1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,480
you know recorded

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,240

to the in the town that's just west of

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,559
me

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,799
yes it was if you need a second career

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,320
but actually now we missed the timer

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,119
right

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,000
it's time to start

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,199
so

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,840
let's do that

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,119
my name is mia clevent i'm the iab chair

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,280
and today russ white is sharing with me

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,680
who is also on the ieb

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,680
and i think we start right away or russ

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,200
do you want to add something

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,079
yeah let me show um the note well uh

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,840
probably you have seen this by by now

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,680
already even so this is an ieb meeting

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,680
it's still a contribution to the ietf so

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,000
you should be aware of the ipr rules and

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,480
all other participation rules um

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,000
especially

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
please notice our code of conduct and

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,320
the anti-harassment procedures um which

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,280
are also uh linked here on the slide

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,240
um

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,920
i don't think we had problems in this

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,760
meeting but it's generally important to

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,760
be friendly to each other to respect

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,920
each other to provide constructive

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,040
feedback to be welcoming newcomers

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,560
so in that sense hopefully we can

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,960
provide uh some good contributions in

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,560
this meeting as well so please keep that

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,799
in mind also not only when you speak up

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,479
but also everywhere and also in the chat

37
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,798
okay

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,200
yeah so we have always have this like

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,799
what is ib open because it's kind of

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,040
still relatively new um but it's not

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,560
that new anymore more we do it for

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,200
nearly two years now um so this is

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,040
really an organized session by the iav

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,720
to focus on some technical and

45
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,040
architectural topics and discussions

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,759
and for two purposes one is to increase

47
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,079
the visibility of what the iap is doing

48
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,399
also to have a forum to to to discuss

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,920
with the community and get feedback from

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,200
the communities that's what we're doing

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,439
here

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,759
um

53
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,040
i wanted to provide a little bit more

54
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,200
information about how to reach the iab

55
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,040
um i usually have this on the slides

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,800
that you can reach the iab directly with

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,200
an email to ib ib.org

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,000
and what we noticed is that not

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
everybody's aware that not only iab

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,319
members are listening to this list so we

61
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,319
have some people from staff also on this

62
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,920
list and hourly source and these kind of

63
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,640
people um so we put this information now

64
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,200
everywhere where you you might look for

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,959
it on the web page and these kind of

66
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,040
things and also want to know people here

67
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,080
about this so everybody's aware

68
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,920

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,959
goes to limited

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,400
set of people

73
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,680
um we have the ib list to reach iab

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,200
we also have some

75
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,040
other lists we have the architectures

76
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,720
discuss list which is really an open

77
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,040
list for community discussion and that's

78
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,239
where all the discussion about

79
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,920
architectural and technical topics

80
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,400
happen and also related to ib documents

81
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
so feel free to subscribe there and free

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,720
to post there and start a discussion

83
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,200
we have just made open mailing this for

84
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,400
programs where the community can also

85
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,720
subscribe and engage in a topic that

86
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,879
into the program you can propose topics

87
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,280
that are related to program scope

88
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,560
and we have this leonardo coordination

89
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,959
coordination mailing it's not a mailing

90
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,920
list it's just an alias basically um

91
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,519
which is relatively new so this is a

92
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,440
direct way if you have any questions

93
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,120
about liaisons

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,720
to reach somebody or to reach the right

95
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,239
person from the iab about that

96
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,480
okay um so um as i said we're talking

97
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,159
about the technical work the iap is

98
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,239
doing here so we will give you a quick

99
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,920
update about um

100
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,480
documents workshops uh programs and so

101
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,760
on and then we have some presentations

102
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,400
so updates we actually have done quite a

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,239
bit of work um

104
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,840
we have published a new document which

105
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,680
is rcm9120

106
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,159
so that was um some

107
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,239
work about um cleanups for apple

108
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,920
basically not too exciting but it's a

109
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
new document

110
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,720
um we have uh one document which is just

111
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,280
out sent out for um

112
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,200
no one document which is already

113
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,920
approved by ib for publication and will

114
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,880
come out as an rfc very soon

115
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,440
and we have still one document that is

116
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,798
under discussion in the ib so it's

117
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,440
already adopted as an document and we

118
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,040
are working on it and you will hopefully

119
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,120
see some progress on that soon

120
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
we have a brand new workshop report out

121
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,360
there which was submitted just um

122
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,160
this week uh on the last workshop that

123
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,919
we organized and wes will tell you about

124
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:36,880
that

125
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,199
and we are running a call for community

126
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,199
feedback about a new document that we

127
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,960
would like to adopt in the iab and start

128
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,720
working on so that's probably the most

129
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,400
important part if you if you want to

130
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,240
provide feedback on this document um

131
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,320
please send it directly to us or go to

132
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,919
the architecture discuss list that's

133
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:52,960
where most of the discussion is

134
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,960
happening

135
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,639
um

136
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,479
i just got a note that my audio and

137
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,240
video is a little bit shoppy is that

138
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,120
true for everybody

139
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,080
because then i turn off my videos

140
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,560
right now we can

141
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,320
it's not horrible but

142
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,440
yeah you're definitely on the edge

143
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,479
okay

144
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,000
maybe this is because my partner is

145
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,360
sitting in the other room also having

146
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,080
video calls as you have it today

147
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,680
so if you don't hear me just read the

148
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,440
slides right it's the same

149
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,880
um

150
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
okay so program updates we have an

151
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,880
update later on on the edm program so i

152
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,400
will not say much we have a second

153
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,240
technical program running and which is a

154
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,800
model t program uh there was an iab

155
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,560
review there was a little bit of silence

156
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,240
recently and there was just a new

157
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
discussion and started right now to

158
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,280
figure out how this group could like

159
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,440
get rescued or continue some work so

160
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,440
probably there will be a meeting on

161
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,120
september 2nd that you might want to

162
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,800
join you can also join the mailing list

163
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,240
or find further information in the data

164
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,280
tracker

165

russ do you want to add something about

166
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,758
the model t program

167
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,759
no no i think that's about right um we

168
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,199
do need to get it moving because it's

169
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,639
interesting work and we just need to

170
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,720
like figure out how to

171
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,039
push

172
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,120
yeah so watch out for that meeting and

173
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,000
subscribe to the list

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,880
um

175
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,120
and then

176
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,039
one more program which is you know not

177
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,520
the classical iab technical program uh

178
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,199
it's it's a special case here because it

179
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,720
works more like working group like a

180
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,800
community um program but you might or

181
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,400
might not be aware of this program it's

182
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,000
the ioc future editor development

183
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,960
program

184
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,199
and this program is working on a new

185
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,680
model for the rfc editor and effectively

186
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,240
it has concluded most of its work and

187
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
there is one document one draft that is

188
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,759
really defining this new model and the

189
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,599
working group last call the program last

190
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,319
call ended last friday so there are

191
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,880
still a few issues to clear out but

192
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,120
nothing big anymore the model as it's

193
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,479
described here in the slide kind of

194
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,520
steps

195
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,039
and there is still an opportunity to

196
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,560
provide more feedback there will be more

197
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,240
community calls before we actually

198
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,400
publish this so please look at the

199
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,720
document not right now read it provide

200
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,680
feedback um to the program mailing list

201
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,520
um and you can also probably join the

202
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,880
next end of our meeting we had a meeting

203
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,120
yesterday and there were not we're still

204
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,280
a few open issues but so we might need

205
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,880
another interim but it's it's nothing

206
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,720
big left so this is really coming to an

207
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,120
end now

208
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,880
and then um iab workshop so another part

209
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,560
of the technical work we're doing and so

210
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,440
we had a workshop on measuring internet

211
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,319
uh internet measuring network quality

212
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,479
for end users uh in september and that

213
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,520
was really uh uh quite well visited we

214
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,560
had a huge amount of um contributions

215
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,400
and very a lot of people in the workshop

216
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,319
i couldn't join but wes will tell you

217
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,319
more about this later and as i said the

218
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,080
report is just out of first version the

219
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,319
first start version um but you might be

220
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,599
able to already find some information

221
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,440
there that's interesting for you

222
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,879
and then we have another workshop that

223
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,720
we will organize end of november and

224
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,840
that workshop isn't analyzing ietf data

225
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,759
so here the idea really is to look at

226
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,080
the data that we provide the metadata

227
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,240
provided drafts and in the data check

228
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,520
about for example authorship

229
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,840
participation and so on and figure out

230
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,680
if we can learn something from it if we

231
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,080
can see trends and what we can analyze

232
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,759
and effectively there's a bunch of

233
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,759
researchers who are already looking into

234
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,120
this so we thought it's good to have

235
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,200
everybody in the room and talk to them

236
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,479
and tell them what we would be

237
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,919
interested in and see if we can learn

238
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,000
something from it and you know how our

239
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
community looks like and how it involves

240
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,839
and how we can improve things in in the

241
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,760
process and in the community so that's

242
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,480
coming up uh and uh

243
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,560
we will uh push the recordings afterward

244
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,080
and i will probably report back at the

245
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,279
next ietf meeting

246
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,279
and with that um

247
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,920
we go properly to the next presentation

248
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,680
except so as i said there will be a

249
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,279
presentation from the

250
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,279
edm program and there will be a

251
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,000
presentation from the last workshop

252
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,600
and i forgot an s here so the

253
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,200
representation the workshop presentation

254
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,630
is not given by we but by width

255
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,040
[Music]

256
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,000
so

257
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,600
you know if there's no agenda bashing or

258
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,480
any questions about what i just

259
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,000
showed we can move on with tommy

260
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,440
but if anybody wants to jump in the

261
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,160
queue it's your time now

262
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,959
or if you want to add something

263
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,600
so i stopped sharing and tommy is coming

264
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,320
up that's great

265
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,440
all right that's going to share slides

266
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,000
thank you

267
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,240
all right so um

268
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,480
i'm tommy pauly one of the leads for the

269
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,079
edm program

270
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,560
my co-lead david is not here he is the

271
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,720
one who has the light up suits that go

272
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,440
well with the edm theme um i can only

273
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,160
give you this slide i apologize

274
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
um anyway so this is our technical

275
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,560
program on evolvability deployability

276
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,320
and maintainability

277
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
everyone is free to join the mailing

278
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,000
list please do it if you're interested

279
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,200
as a quick status update we've had two

280
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,680
calls since the last ietf meeting and

281
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,040
the last iab open

282
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,320
one of those was to wrap up on draft ib

283
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,560
use it or lose it

284
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,600
which

285
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,680
was uh mainly authored by martin

286
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,600
thompson and then we kind of completed

287
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,360
it in the working group

288
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,959
that is currently in the rfc editor

289
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,160
queue and should be published soon so

290
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,240
really happy that we can get that moved

291
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,519
along i think that's going to be a very

292
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,320
useful contribution

293
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,680
so now we're essentially moving on to

294
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,640
starting up some new efforts

295
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,240
there's another existing draft that

296
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,680
we're looking at

297
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,600
but the thing i want to talk about today

298
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,240
is what we had our last meeting on

299
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,760
which was discussing how we track

300
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,360
protocol implementations and

301
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,440
deployability

302
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,399
all right so

303
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,240
why does this matter why are we talking

304
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,200
about this

305
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,800
in an ib program why in this program

306
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,640
i mean overall

307
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,279
running code is how we determine

308
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,720
deployability before we ship our

309
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,200
protocols it's a very important part of

310
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
our process here

311
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,120
and as we're looking at

312
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,600
the evolvability of protocols and how

313
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,200
well they can be deployed

314
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,959
understanding

315
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,880
kind of the practical aspects of how our

316
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,200
implementation's working

317
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,440
helps us get a clearer and more

318
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,240
practical view

319
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,320
so

320
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,720
tracking the implementations is also a

321
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,440
way to help implementations do interop

322
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,240
testing we see a lot of uh success in

323
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,680
working groups that are able to do a lot

324
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,279
of interop

325
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,320
testing and that helps them um

326
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,480
validate that their protocol is working

327
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,160
and will be deployable

328
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,639
on the internet uh dealing with middle

329
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,079
boxes and understanding where

330
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,599
ossification has already happened

331
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,200
um also you know looking long-term

332
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,920
towards the maintenance of protocols

333
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,320
it's important to understand how

334
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,360
features have been adopted which ones

335
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,200
are like what extension points are

336
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
actually working which ones are

337
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,959
successful and

338
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,880
understanding how protocols are being

339
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,440
used helps us get a feedback into that

340
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,839
loop

341
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,639
so uh

342
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,120
charles eckel uh wrote

343
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,279
a quick draft just to spark that

344
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,480
conversation and that's what we talked

345
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,800
about the last meeting

346
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,680
is the edm find code draft

347
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,600
it summarized some of the current tools

348
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
that people have to talk about

349
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,920
implementation status um

350
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,680
there's an implementation status section

351
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,240
of drafts that's defined that gets

352
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,200
removed before publication

353
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,360
so that's one way people can approach

354
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,120
this problem

355
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,639
and some working groups use it some

356
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,800
don't

357
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,680
you have github repos and wikis to track

358
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,920
implementation status and of course

359
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,399
there's itf hackathon events and

360
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,160
associated wikis and those are all very

361
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,560
successful

362
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,920
but part of the problem is that this is

363
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,839
not

364
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,000
necessarily very discoverable

365
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,480
and there's a lot of variety and so

366
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,920
we're wondering if there are ways to

367
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,720
help

368
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,519
uh

369
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,120
working groups that want to do this type

370
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,399
of thing

371
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,880
have a really easy way to

372
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,040
start doing this and

373
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,120
get their

374
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,480
draft authors and implementers involved

375
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,000
so some of the ideas the draft puts

376
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,279
forward

377
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,199
is that you could have essentially links

378
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,720
to your running code or implementation

379
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,440
status or interop test matrix

380
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,240
that you could get too easily

381
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,399
from places like your data tracker or

382
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,399
from your working group github or even

383
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,480
through the metadata that's associated

384
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,680
with drafts and rfcs

385
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,000
so in order to understand what would be

386
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,240
useful here the first thing we've done

387
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,040
is

388
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
send out a survey

389
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,320
to all the working group chairs to

390
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,639
understand what's currently being done

391
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,160
so here's just a little example of some

392
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,320
of the stuff we're asking

393
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,639
this was sent out i think a week and a

394
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,480
half for two weeks ago we've had some

395
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,959
responses if you are here and you are a

396
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,399
working group chair

397
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,920
and you have not filled out the survey

398
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,279
yet

399
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,800
please look at your email and fill out

400
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,240
the survey we'd love to hear from you

401
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,399
so we'll talk about this at our next

402
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,839
actual meeting

403
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,680
but just some of the initial

404
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,920
stats when i looked at this earlier this

405
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,279
week

406
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,199
you know most of the working groups

407
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,800
slightly over half are tracking

408
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,600
implementation status in some way

409
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,800
i think we definitely see different

410
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,040
trends in different areas of the ietf

411
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,240
and the methods are inconsistent

412
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,000
but almost all of the working group

413
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,279
chairs said that they would like to have

414
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,959
the information about their

415
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,240
implementation status be more

416
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,399
discoverable for people who are coming

417
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,079
into their working groups

418
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,519
and most of them also express that they

419
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,880
would like to be able to track this

420
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,800
implementation status in a

421
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,040
consistent way after rfc publication

422
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,519
which is something that the current

423
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,680
guidance around an implementation status

424
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,160
section of a draft does not provide

425
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,839
so i think there's interesting stuff to

426
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,040
discuss here

427
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,639
and we'll be discussing this more at our

428
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,920
next meeting

429
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,240
amongst other topics and we'll probably

430
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,959
report back to iab open as well

431
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,160
so if there are any questions or

432
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,880
thoughts love to hear them

433
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,120
pete

434
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,279
am i here yes i am here yay

435
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,880
uh first first hooray yes this is great

436
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,959
thank you this is this is absolutely

437
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,000
brilliant

438
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,120
um

439
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,360
i wonder how much

440
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,160
the um isg has talked to you about this

441
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,480
and whether this could be folded into

442
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,199
the moving along the standards track

443
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,240
stuff that we've done a lousy job with

444
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,120
for i can't remember how many years

445
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,399
um

446
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,759
this seems like it would fold in

447
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,480
brilliantly and if it became sort of

448
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,680
something that

449
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,000
working groups just did it would make

450
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
that whole question much easier

451
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,399
yeah i i think you know the isg is

452
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,720
aware of this topic but we're definitely

453
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,920
going to be talking to them more as

454
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,920
especially as we get some feedback here

455
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,279
can you elaborate just a little bit more

456
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:41,920
on

457
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,759
how how are you imagining that could

458
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,399
work just so i understand for now

459
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,600
so i i mean ideal world my my thought

460
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,639
would be

461
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,000
um

462
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,759
you know all working groups would just

463
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,920
sort of do this as a matter of course it

464
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,759
would be the thing you do when you're

465
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,160
working on something you put it into the

466
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,360
implementation pipeline at that point

467
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,160
you know we used to have this just

468
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,959
horrible time convincing people to move

469
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,400
things along the standards track which

470
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,559
is why we went you know got rid of draft

471
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,160
standard um this to me just

472
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,480
and and people still are not great about

473
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,720
moving things to full standard if this

474
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,679
was just widespread people would i think

475
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,439
sort of fall into it and say oh sure

476
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,520
yeah if we've got all the data to show

477
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,320
that we're widely deployed and and

478
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,280
you know implementations are

479
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
interoperable they would just do it and

480
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,200
we'd have a lot more stuff

481
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,799
getting a standard

482
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,520
yep yeah totally and it would also yeah

483
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,280
and it would also reduce the temptation

484
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,520
to stay at proposed standard forever and

485
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
have the entire internet run on proposed

486
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,400
standard

487
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,640
um which kind of

488
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,039
sort of reduces the utility of calling

489
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,039
things standards in the first place so

490
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,720
this all seems great

491
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,160
yeah yeah and you know certainly i think

492
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,480
we can have the view that

493
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,480
okay the yeah the label between proposed

494
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,919
standard and standard you know i've

495
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,280
heard it expressed that yeah that's just

496
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,440
kind of a vanity label but

497
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,200
exactly it actually means something and

498
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,640
be related to

499
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,240
the fact that we know

500
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,480
that this actually is being used could

501
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,120
make it more meaningful again

502
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,840
yeah

503
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,679
thank you so yay team yay team

504
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,360
cool

505
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,960
all right any other questions or

506
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,720
thoughts

507
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,559
and i see that

508
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,760
charles has dropped the link to the

509
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,240
survey in so anyone who wants to fill

510
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,200
that out fill it out

511
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,080
all right thank you

512
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,360
tommy

513
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,600
uh and then we go to wii u

514
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,520
do you want to join us here

515
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,559
you got my name wrong so you know

516
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,039
a little bit of flock

517
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,440
um do you want to request sharing

518
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,310
yeah i'm gonna check

519
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,829
[Music]

520
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,910
[Music]

521
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,960
i naturally closed the

522
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,400
viewer rate is the raise again you can

523
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,280
use this um share preloaded slides

524
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,360
button right next to the hint button and

525
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,640
that will just give you the slides from

526
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,320
the data tracker but you have to press

527
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,240
it yourself

528
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,480
it's true

529
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,440
we don't see mine

530
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,039
under your name you have the joint

531
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,640
button and then there's this kind of

532
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,280
page thing

533
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,000
let's do it with the other button but

534
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,799
you can also use that one

535
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,678
all right you see those

536
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,159
[Music]

537
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,640
see the slides i assume okay

538
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,080
uh so i'm going to talk about the ib

539
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,679
workshop for measuring network quality

540
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,919
for end users which we just held we had

541
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,919
three chairs for it a very large program

542
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,600
committee and as you'll see in a minute

543
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,559
a

544
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,039
large quantity of participation too

545
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,559
which was awesome

546
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,159
uh so a little bit of background you

547
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,240
know the world connectivity has gotten

548
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,400
much much better i think you know the

549
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,320
the prevalence of increased bandwidth

550
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,559
everywhere has been fantastic we

551
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,480
actually now can do video chats that was

552
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,840
not possible just a few short years ago

553
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,600
but you know everybody still experiences

554
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,240
local outages and issues that uh that

555
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,039
cause issues as myria noted earlier she

556
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,200
had sort of connectivity issues earlier

557
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,600
in this this meeting alone

558
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,840
and certainly we all have those at times

559
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,280
and you know there's a lot of inner

560
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,840
application resource competition too uh

561
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,080
there's there was video discussions i

562
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,640
think in map rg this week about

563
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,440
what happens when multiple video streams

564
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,200
are trying to compete for

565
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,880
for competition and which one wins and

566
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,240
examining the differences between

567
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
different uh platforms you know

568
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,840
they're not all equal

569
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,559
so

570
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,640
the goal was you know what what how can

571
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,520
we identify problem spaces in this area

572
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
what what is a good user experience

573
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,360
users often don't know this themselves

574
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,360
and and if if users don't know how can

575
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,520
we measure it and then how can we

576
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,679
communicate these measurements uh can we

577
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,240
do it in a standardized way and are

578
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,919
there measurements that we can

579
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,240
do that users can actually understand or

580
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,240
at least be able to report other than

581
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,360
some things were not working

582
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,080
the

583
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,679
this is a graph from

584
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,480
david reed who attended the the workshop

585
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,880
and presented this slide and was one of

586
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,600
many fantastic presentations that shows

587
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,480
the fcc's longitudinal trend for you

588
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,280
know

589
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,360
load over data cable over over time and

590
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,200
you can see that it's getting

591
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,640
better so there's latency on the

592
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,320
left-hand side and latency is just

593
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
generally decreasing over time

594
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,480
um which is fantastic that's kind of one

595
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,200
of the metrics that we want to see

596
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,880
but still

597
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,919
this is from lucas perdue who who had

598
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,840
you know when you start thinking about

599
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,320
where the problems are right there's

600
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
there's a huge number of potential

601
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,080
problems including one of the ones that

602
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,760
was discussed a lot during the workshop

603
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,440
because it was humorous and because it

604
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,000
was a good um a good example of you know

605
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
my mom was microwaving a potato and it

606
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,840
caused you know the wi-fi connection to

607
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,880
go bad

608
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,799
um and you know you can imagine trying

609
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,400
to get those predicted by the average

610
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,799
end user as to what exactly is causing

611
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,320
the problem all they know is something's

612
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,080
not working they don't necessarily know

613
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,080
why

614
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,559
so we held a workshop on this on

615
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,720
september 14th to the 16th we hold it on

616
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,000
webex and we had three days and it was

617
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,440
four hours a day

618
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,919
and there was an hour set aside you know

619
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:08,960
or

620
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,280
plus there was an hour afterwards where

621
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,960
people just hung out afterwards and and

622
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,039
talked for an additional hours beyond

623
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,000
just the

624
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,919
the four hours a day so it was it was

625
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,520
neat that we had some side channel

626
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,679
discussions and breakout rooms happen as

627
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,640
well

628
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,559
there was 90 different attendees total

629
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,000
when i finally looked at the logs and

630
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,320
counted them all when we were taking

631
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,919
notes we noted that there was at least

632
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,000
76 at one particular time

633
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,600
but at least 90 different people

634
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,679
participated over the course of of the

635
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,919
three days uh which is a fair amount for

636
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,600
a workshop that's not a that's that's a

637
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,520
fairly large ieb workshop and certainly

638
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,279
if we held it in a physical in a

639
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,720
physical room that couldn't have

640
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,799
happened so there's some benefit to

641
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,320
virtual meetings uh because you can

642
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,559
actually certainly take in a lot more

643
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,640
people

644
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,240
every the way that we had structured the

645
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,679
workshop between the chairs and the

646
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,200
program committee is we had three to

647
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,440
four five minute presentations with

648
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,919
clarifying questions afterwards and then

649
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,919
we allowed for a lot of discussion time

650
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,520
and that format seemed to really work

651
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,320
well

652
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,559
the discussion times were were never

653
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,159
blank there was always you know people

654
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,520
wanting to talk and discuss things so

655
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,679
we aimed for discussion and that worked

656
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,440
quite well

657
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,240
we broke the workshop down into details

658
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,200
so after reviewing a lot of the short

659
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,039
papers that were submitted

660
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,720
we realized that they sort of broke into

661
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,240
a number of categories so we had

662
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,279
introduction and background

663
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,039
presentations about you know where are

664
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,120
we today or you know what's what's the

665
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,520
current status and and how does what

666
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,960
metrics uh

667
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,200
you know are being used today followed

668
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,000
by

669
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
considerations of what metrics you know

670
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,520
we should actually be

671
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,960
thinking about or concentrating on or

672
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,240
what's broken with current ones and

673
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,440
things like that

674
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,120
and there's a lot of discussion around

675
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,240
cross layer in other words how do

676
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,000
you know multiple things interact and

677
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,080
there's there's multiple aspects of of

678
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,400
cross layer which i i think i have a

679
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,600
little bit more detail on the later

680
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,159
slide but consider wireless versus wired

681
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,320
consider you know multiple layers of of

682
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,960
the osi stack and all of these types of

683
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,880
things it's that's one of the things

684
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,120
that makes it hard right is you you need

685
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,200
to be able to measure stuff you know not

686
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,760
just at one place because that's not the

687
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,440
only place if anybody's ever studied

688
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,799
ping or trace route you know they're

689
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,240
very different applications and even

690
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,360
traceroute which has a lot more

691
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,360
information does not tell you exactly

692
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,840
where the problem is on the path

693
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,919
and then finally a synthesis of people

694
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,600
that were offering sort of bigger

695
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,240
solutions or or more global views was

696
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,840
sort of the concluding

697
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,000
of the four sections and then we

698
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,720
we did offer a a conclusion discussion

699
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,480
at the very last hour which i'll go over

700
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,360
next but uh so the goal was to to go

701
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,120
from you know background through

702
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,200
thinking through you know

703
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,279
sort of solutions as the workshop

704
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,360
progressed

705
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,400
so we took 30 minutes at the end to

706
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,159
allow people and this was sort of an

707
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,640
experiment that i i kind of came up with

708
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,799
to allow people to

709
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,880
uh just make statements that they

710
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,799
thought everybody might agree with right

711
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,640
what were conclusions that kind of came

712
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,159
out of all of the discussions over the

713
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,279
course of three days uh that people

714
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,600
thought were were

715
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,880
statements that everybody else would

716
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,960
stand up behind and so 24 sentences were

717
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
written down and we asked clarifying

718
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,559
questions about them only as this was

719
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,159
going on and then we took another 30

720
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,520
minutes to you know where people could

721
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,880
actually say wait a minute i disagree

722
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,080
with that one that one's not under

723
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,600
consensus

724
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,520
after that we actually only eliminated

725
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,679
five is really not achieving consensus

726
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,080
consensus out of 24 which um that ratio

727
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,400
to me surprised me um as as we know in

728
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,720
the atf we like to debate uh

729
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,360
everything right but so you know a good

730
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,279
percentage of them actually came out is

731
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,960
generally accepted

732
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,400
and then i later grouped them and

733
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,360
documented into the internet draft

734
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,679
so you can go read them i edited them a

735
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,279
bit for context and added more

736
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,799
information some of them were shorter

737
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,039
and you know they were

738
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,400
really well understood by people that

739
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,240
attended the group more than anything

740
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,360
else

741
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,120
so i'm going to go over them in general

742
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,880
and i group them into a number of

743
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,000
different sections and i added bold

744
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,840
words where i think you know you might

745
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,520
find the most interesting you know

746
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,279
points coming around one of the nice

747
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,559
things that kind of came out is there's

748
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,120
a number of short term statements

749
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,159
that

750
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,679
that i think describe the state of of

751
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,080
network quality today right bandwidth is

752
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,960
necessary but not alone sufficient

753
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,480
um one of the things that i think has

754
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,240
been pushed heavily i should say the

755
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,600
workshop really thought has been pushed

756
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,760
heavily in the past decade has been we

757
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,200
just need more speed more speed more

758
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,279
speed and that's that's not sufficient

759
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,279
and that's not you know alone what you

760
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,520
need uh i think gamers know that well

761
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,640
that they need better bandwidth and

762
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,880
better latency and game gaming was

763
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,039
talked about a lot because it's a

764
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,520
low latency desired application

765
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,200
so you really need better bandwidth

766
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,440
right you need you know not just more

767
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,960
bandwidth but you need better bandwidth

768
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,919
how can we make it better and

769
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,600
in order to really figure out if that's

770
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,919
working you need both active and passive

771
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,520
measurements you need the ability to do

772
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,799
pings and trace routes and things like

773
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,399
that that i just mentioned but you also

774
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,520
need to be able to do passive

775
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,880
measurements and how much bandwidth is

776
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,440
going by or um you know what sort of

777
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,200
applications are

778
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,279
using data across the network and and

779
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,440
how can i use what i see in order to

780
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,200
measure it

781
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,360
but even active and path measurements

782
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,600
aren't useful if you can't compare

783
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,120
things over time

784
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,000
so you need archivable and queryable

785
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
metrics as well so that you can look at

786
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,840
trends over time like the graph that i

787
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,919
showed previously you know you need to

788
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,679
be able to to see are we trending the

789
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,240
right direction or what's getting worse

790
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,240
i think anybody studying academic papers

791
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,919
knows that you know longitudinal papers

792
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,200
are often the most interesting because

793
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,120
they really show trends over time

794
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,559
but a meaningful metric for users is

795
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,559
is this network going to work for me

796
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,480
will my application the thing that i

797
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,440
want to do is it going to work

798
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,840
and and this is where we get down to how

799
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,679
do you measure stuff for end users in a

800
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,000
way that they will understand and you

801
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,760
know quite frequently it's does my

802
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,840
application work or is my network

803
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,679
insufficient do i you know do i have the

804
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,120
right sufficient characteristics in a

805
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,200
network or not

806
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,919
and

807
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,159
one of the other important takeaways is

808
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,799
measurements are useless if you don't

809
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,559
actually make change if you don't

810
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,480
incentivize goodness

811
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,799
right so metrics that are measured

812
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,480
should be actionable can we make

813
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,120
decisions based on measurements

814
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,880
and are they you know are they

815
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,240
actionable to the point where we can

816
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,679
improve things

817
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,080
or make changes to a network in order to

818
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,279
to

819
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,799
to improve things

820
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,720
and one other thing that came out was

821
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,760
you know

822
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
we in the ietf and and of course in the

823
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,120
ib workshops

824
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,039
the the goal should be to benefit all

825
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,880
end users and just

826
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,440
segmenting a a

827
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,000
solution into something that is just for

828
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,240
a small section of the internet is

829
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,480
not exactly ideal right we should come

830
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,840
up with technologies that benefit

831
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,480
everyone everywhere

832
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,840
there's a bunch of more specific

833
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,039
statements and i'm not going to read

834
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,720
each one of these quite as much as i did

835
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,559
the generals but

836
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,480
one metric that was thrown around a lot

837
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,640
is round trips per minute it's a useful

838
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,640
and consumable metric i think on the

839
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,399
server side that's been used for a long

840
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,320
time but it's also useful on the on the

841
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,000
user side as well of

842
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,640
of how many transactions can i can i do

843
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,880
or something like that per minute um but

844
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,480
it's you know you need to consider the

845
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,279
full communication path from client to

846
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,520
server and back and uh you know how many

847
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,840
times can you can you do that cycle it's

848
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,840
not just a one-way trip for example

849
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,520
applications you know are really needed

850
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,760
that are new that can report good

851
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,600
measurements in order to identify

852
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,080
insufficient points in network access so

853
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,840
this is this is i think one of the

854
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,279
largest things that we're missing today

855
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,080
is i know that my my network is broken i

856
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,120
know that

857
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,360
uh my somebody on the other side has

858
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,880
taken a measurement of my video quality

859
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,000
and my audio quality and uh you know and

860
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,080
told me that it's not good right and

861
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,519
which reminds me i hope that it's still

862
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,880
good because i could just be talking to

863
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,120
myself i have no way of knowing right i

864
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,559
have no way of actually understanding

865
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,519
whether my uh my video and audio is

866
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,200
actually getting out okay

867
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,720
until somebody interrupts me to say no

868
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,240
no you're still good or nonsense or

869
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,600
something like that like you get in a

870
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,720
room

871
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,840
um

872
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,799
and so we you know we need better um

873
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,480
things that can actually identify

874
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,559
problem points across the whole

875
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,480
you know network from from one point to

876
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,080
another or more likely you know these

877
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,679
days you're actually having network

878
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,279
applications that are reaching out to a

879
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,039
lot of different places and where is the

880
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,159
exact

881
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,159
javascript being pulled down to a web

882
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,360
page that's actually breaking that i

883
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,880
can't get to that little piece as

884
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,720
opposed to everything else that actually

885
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,880
is loading properly

886
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,559
so we need you know simple metrics and

887
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,279
we need metrics per application which uh

888
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,519
users are able to consume and report you

889
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,279
know issues about what is working and

890
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,679
what is not um i was noticing when i was

891
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,679
looking at the data tracker earlier that

892
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,080
that you know i had to click submit and

893
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,320
i didn't get any feedback that that my

894
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,159
submit actually went through right i had

895
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,600
no notion of of yes it is taking a bit

896
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
it is loading because it was loading in

897
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,679
the background and so that's to me i

898
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,039
wasn't sure if it was my network i

899
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,240
wasn't sure if it was the server i

900
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,519
wasn't sure if it was the the

901
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,799
application

902
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:19,919
um

903
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:20,960
one of the other things that we talked

904
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,720
about a lot is the differences between

905
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,320
quality of service versus quality of

906
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,120
experience uh so you know those are

907
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,000
thrown around quite a bit but um

908
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
uh they're they're

909
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,200
they are they are sort of the

910
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,559
quintessential things of how do we

911
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,080
measure quality of service and how do we

912
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,440
measure quality of experience when

913
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,039
they're not quite equal right how do we

914
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,279
measure what the user is actually doing

915
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,600
or experiencing

916
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,960
we also looked at some problem

917
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,360
statements and concerns so

918
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,200
some of the the statements that were

919
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,440
made during the conclusion section were

920
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,279
related to

921
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,559
things that we

922
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,960
we had issues with latency mean and

923
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,799
medians or distractions

924
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,000
is one

925
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,840
you know the interesting thing is if you

926
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,120
i think most people know that if you

927
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,720
look at gaussian curves or all sorts of

928
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,200
other you know metrics for

929
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,799
trying to determine

930
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,200
uh you know some statistical average

931
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,880
about something that if you just look at

932
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,080
the mean in the media and you're missing

933
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,600
a whole lot of information right a mean

934
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,519
and a medium can be great uh but the

935
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,440
standard deviation is so large that you

936
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,039
know you end up with a lot of brokenness

937
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,960
well beyond the mean and median for just

938
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,799
as an example

939
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,200
um and the second bullet there is

940
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,640
actually kind of similar to some some

941
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,559
things that we said before some of these

942
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,080
statements actually did have a lot of

943
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,399
overlap but it's frustrating that you

944
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,159
know if you can only measure stuff but

945
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,240
you can't simultaneously improve them

946
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,760
right we should be able to improve them

947
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,039
as well

948
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,440
and we need to figure out a way to

949
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,919
motivate those improvements right so we

950
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,840
need to come up with incentives for

951
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,679
public network access

952
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,440
that will motivate them and again this

953
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,679
is similar to you know if if you just

954
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,919
measure it then that's not uh that's not

955
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,200
very helpful

956
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,480
and there was some discussion about the

957
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,960
ecological impact of you know one

958
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,640
interesting aspect of measuring network

959
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,480
quality is not just how well it works

960
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,000
but how well it's damaging the

961
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
environment or how how well

962
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,760
um everything is

963
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,960
in the long run we could have great

964
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,800
networks that you do lots of bitcoin

965
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,960
mining that's fantastic but you know is

966
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,719
that is that a long-term

967
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,639
uh goal or will it actually you know

968
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,560
cause later issues that will

969
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,320
eventually erode our networks for

970
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,679
example

971
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,960
um

972
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,040
and you know there's there's not

973
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,918
evidence that any single metric is more

974
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,359
important than others and one of the

975
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,119
hard things that that i

976
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,399
don't think that the workshop came to a

977
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,480
complete conclusion about is

978
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,480
how do you do prioritization across

979
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,839
multiple metrics how do you find the

980
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,679
right metric for the right time

981
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,280
for the right component of a um

982
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,599
of a network right how do you know

983
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,679
there's not anyone that is perfect and

984
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,119
some are better than others and how do

985
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,079
you

986
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,520
manage to put them all into one

987
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,440
situation or one evaluation and get a

988
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,400
concrete solution out of it

989
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,720
so in terms of future work we want to

990
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,119
document the the workshop um the draft

991
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,599
iab and and that is the

992
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,680
uh that acronym is yet horrible but i

993
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,200
figured we're good at horrible acronyms

994
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,720
so i just included but it's measuring

995
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,240
network quality for end users because it

996
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,680
was too long to fit in the draft name so

997
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,000
i shortened it to an acronym that i

998
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,920
don't think had been used until i put it

999
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,520
into the draft

1000
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,920
it is in the um ieb uh the internet

1001
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,160
architecture github repository people

1002
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,760
are welcome to do it

1003
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,160
there is the url that takes you to the

1004
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,119
workshop itself all of the workshop

1005
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,760
discussions were actually held in uh on

1006
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,680
recorded videos so they're all in

1007
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,920
youtube and there's links to them as

1008
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,240
well as all of the papers from that that

1009
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,400
link that's a it was fascinating to

1010
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,079
listen to it in fact i still want to go

1011
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,440
back and re-watch it all before we

1012
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,760
finish publishing the entire report

1013
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,920
um and then there's discussions about

1014
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,760
where to go next right so we need to

1015
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,800
bring the work forward uh there is some

1016
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,960
tasks that likely can be delegated to

1017
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,560
existing atf working groups if there's

1018
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,640
immediate work to be done and there was

1019
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,400
general you know interest in where do we

1020
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,240
take longer term stuff and i think that

1021
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,920
the the takeout is really we should take

1022
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,480
research tests to the irtf uh there was

1023
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,920
a little bit of discussion of do we need

1024
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,160
an ieb program for this um i think the

1025
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,720
general consideration is

1026
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,480
this is probably not program worthy at

1027
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,079
this point but um

1028
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,760
we have enough breakdown between iutf

1029
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,079
working groups and irtf research groups

1030
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,200
that were

1031
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,040
were probably okay so

1032
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,680
that is it for slides i think i took it

1033
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,000
almost exactly ten minutes is there any

1034
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
questions or discussion on this

1035
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,409
[Music]

1036
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,359
is there any discussions for the

1037
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,200
microphone

1038
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,560
yeah maybe people want to bring it to

1039
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,079
the microphone somewhat

1040
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,440
yeah

1041
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,960
i will say you know there's so much

1042
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,119
information in that workshop it was hard

1043
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,760
to um there's no way to summarize it all

1044
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,760
and there was it was a very dense

1045
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,320
working workshop uh which was fantastic

1046
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,160
to participate in but i was you know

1047
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,000
looking at writing the draft going i

1048
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,599
don't even know how to summarize all

1049
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,000
that so

1050
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,240
yeah i think the the discussion in the

1051
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,920
chat is is actually a little bit about

1052
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,400
metrics and there's also a draft in iqp

1053
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,640
i'm talking about random times per

1054
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,720
minute as a different metric to use for

1055
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,920
example

1056
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,440
um i guess there was also a lot of

1057
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,040
discussion at the workshop about metrics

1058
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,000
right

1059
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,320
yeah i mean to throw out the ippm our

1060
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
working group is the most likely place

1061
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,880
for for follow-on work to go but

1062
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,560
trying to be generic and not pigeonhole

1063
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,520
it exactly there

1064
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,360
okay

1065
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,119
[Music]

1066
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,880
in that case i will turn it back to you

1067
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,440
guys i think

1068
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,280
yeah i mean

1069
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,800
people can still join the queue if they

1070
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,760
want to

1071
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,280
have more discussion because that's why

1072
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,480
we're here

1073
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,520
um we don't have any other agenda item

1074
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,720
we

1075
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,280
have the usual mic spot so people can

1076
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,880
also just join the queue for any other

1077
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,320
questions they have to the iep if they

1078
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,640
want to

1079
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,200
and maybe to um i mean we we have the

1080
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,599
technical plenary which was already um

1081
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,800
last week

1082
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,520
and

1083
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,359
usually in the not in the technical so

1084
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,880
we had the administration then already

1085
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,800
last week already so usually we try to

1086
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,760
concentrate on more of the

1087
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,320
administrative questions at that plenary

1088
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,680
um so this this open mic is really more

1089
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,320
for technical questions um

1090
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,240
based on any kind of workshop any kind

1091
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,000
of documents working on workshops or

1092
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,480
programs or even if you want to raise a

1093
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,000
topic that you think the ib should be

1094
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,040
aware of

1095
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,759
that's your chance

1096
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,920
and we have martin

1097
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,920
i just want to

1098
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,240
say what i said in the chat which put in

1099
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,320
a plug for ippm next session which is

1100
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,320
going to have a a draft about rpm

1101
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,839
okay i mean if there if there's nobody

1102
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,440
who wants to speak up has any questions

1103
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,200
or any comments we can actually close

1104
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,480
the session here but i'm feeling a

1105
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,920
little bit bad if i would close the

1106
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,200
session now while they're still

1107
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,680
discussing going in the chat

1108
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,640
um

1109
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,760
so i give you a few more minutes to

1110
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,839
take the chance and speak up in the mic

1111
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,480
chance

1112
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,640
yeah i had a quick question for uh

1113
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,480
actually for tommy on the survey is

1114
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,599
there a

1115
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,440
deadline or perhaps we should set a

1116
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,760
deadline for when responses are

1117
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,359
requested there so people know if that's

1118
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,640
something they need to kind of quickly

1119
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,160
do this week or

1120
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,760
i think we'll get more responses if we

1121
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,359
put a deadline everyone's deadline

1122
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,440
training

1123
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,960
yeah yeah you've

1124
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,160
gotten a fair amount of responses um

1125
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,040
i've been pretty happy with that so far

1126
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,560
i'm hoping that you know this reminder

1127
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,880
and maybe i'll send a ping to the list

1128
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,359
uh today just to tell people hey

1129
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,960
here's the link again

1130
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,720
go fill it out

1131
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,680
but

1132
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,599
i i imagine after

1133
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,119
just kind of naturally after like a week

1134
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,880
or so anyone who's going to respond will

1135
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,640
respond um

1136
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,760
something necessary it's a deadline but

1137
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,480
yeah probably you know by

1138
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,680
you know

1139
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,599
certainly by december i'll just say okay

1140
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,119
here's the results and we'll go look at

1141
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,280
it as a program

1142
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,079
okay

1143
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,680
and then uh you know one other thing i

1144
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,520
put in the chat just kind of more of a

1145
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,640
comment is

1146
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,560
uh you know my personal interest with

1147
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,800
the fine code draft is also a bit

1148
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,119
broader than implementation

1149
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,760
uh status and funding yeah the

1150
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,760
interoperability aspect which is super

1151
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,160
important and i think a goal

1152
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,319
as well but i'm also very interested in

1153
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,079
just any code related to it like some of

1154
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,119
the code that we've done in the

1155
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,359
hackathon and it kind of helps you with

1156
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,960
understanding a protocol or maybe

1157
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,560
implementing it or

1158
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,440
or viewing traffic on network or you

1159
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,040
know any kind of test tools those types

1160
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,520
of things too are super helpful just to

1161
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,920
get people help people to um to

1162
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,520
implement some of the standards that

1163
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,040
we're

1164
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,640
specifying in these drafts so i'd be

1165
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,640
interested in that as well

1166
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,920
yep

1167
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,160
thank you

1168
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,359
and we have spent any queue

1169
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,079
um

1170
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,440
i

1171
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,560
i wanted to thank the uh

1172
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,760
the ieb for doing the uh

1173
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,880
public

1174
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,720
viewing of it uh of ib meetings

1175
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,400
uh and for one specific reason uh which

1176
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,000
was um

1177
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,640
the iab has been doing

1178
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,000
uh

1179
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,040
reviews of research groups uh on an

1180
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,920
ongoing basis for as long as i as long

1181
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,720
as i have known about

1182
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,200
and they have not tended to be very

1183
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,640
public

1184
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,160
i had the opportunity to

1185
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,119
watch

1186
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,119
not participate in but watch the pen rg

1187
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,040
review that the iab did fairly recently

1188
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,040
and having that be benefited and

1189
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,520
viewable as you know as it was happening

1190
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,720
and things like that was super uh useful

1191
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,839
for

1192
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,359
me and i

1193
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,119
hope other

1194
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,520
research group participants will take

1195
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,160
advantage of that when the iab is uh

1196
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,079
reviewing reviewing their research

1197
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,920
groups

1198
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,079
thank you all for doing that

1199
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,920
thank you for the feedback so um yeah

1200
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,599
you're right that these reviews haven't

1201
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,560
been

1202
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,640
that much public because usually we used

1203
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,280
to do them during the meeting week um in

1204
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,119
one of our breakfast meetings and those

1205
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,599
are not as public as our calls usually

1206
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,520
are and given the circumstances we now

1207
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,440
have integrated them into our frequent

1208
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,920
calls so we can scan them anytime and

1209
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,680
those calls are actually open for

1210
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,480
observers so you can join any any ib

1211
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,280
call and listening

1212
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,720
rust if you want to editing or are you

1213
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,319
just here to say goodbye

1214
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,599
no i think i'm good i would encourage

1215
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,440
people to join the ib

1216
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,520
that the calls that they can join other

1217
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,160
than executive sessions as an observer

1218
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,520
we have a lot of good technical stuff

1219
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,359
going on right now and

1220
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,960
we actually have a lot of drafts and

1221
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,000
stuff we could use help with

1222
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,040
yeah i mean

1223
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,280
check out the iv webpage and try to find

1224
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,200
the agenda there it's there's actually a

1225
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,640
direct link on the front page on the on

1226
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,920
the right side

1227
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,160
um and you can see that we not only have

1228
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,000
those boring iab calls where we talk

1229
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
about administrative matters we now have

1230
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,359
actually calls that we label as

1231
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,960
technical discussions where we only

1232
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,720
discuss one technical topic so this

1233
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,640
could be interesting for you as well

1234
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,040
um if you want to check out but also as

1235
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,400
you just said documents i just want to

1236
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,880
remind people please review um the past

1237
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,400
english document which where we have the

1238
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,359
call for feedback um out there right now

1239
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,200
and and

1240
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,640
check out the other work we are doing in

1241
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,480
the programs and now we have more people

1242
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,599
in the queue so robin is next

1243
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:51,680
robin we i think we heard you already if

1244
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,040
you say something

1245
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,480
okay uh in fact i my this the

1246
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,640
my some this the

1247
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,560
one who has some of these comments on

1248
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,560
this is the drought that's the past

1249
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,200
signal yeah because you know that's the

1250
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,240
this time we have this the the epm work

1251
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,040
and we propose that's the solution

1252
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,960
that uh incu

1253
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,560
including the

1254
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,960
data plane encapsulation and also this

1255
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,079
is the uh control plane and this is the

1256
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,480
young model for this work so this will

1257
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,280
be helpful to understand this one yeah

1258
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,200
but you know that's the

1259
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,200
from my point of view so you'll notice

1260
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,040
there's also

1261
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,480
also there's the

1262
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,280
discussion about the open internet and

1263
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,119
the limited domain

1264
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,160
and according to our this the discussion

1265
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,079
about this the

1266
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,200
apm work so we can feel this

1267
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,599
so we can feel this that possible

1268
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,800
difference even for this the past signal

1269
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,359
and also the eating work seems

1270
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:54,160
uh

1271
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,400
similar that's the

1272
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,440
application and the networking that's

1273
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,480
this

1274
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,760
integration but you know that's for the

1275
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,000
for the apm worker that is the limited

1276
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,359
domain so you can use only use available

1277
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,000
this is the package header information

1278
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,520
to map to some of this the uh api id

1279
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,680
but you know that's if this is a pass

1280
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,800
signal so this is maybe that means this

1281
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,599
the signal information can be directly

1282
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,280
derived at the host and the application

1283
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,640
that is maybe more specific because it's

1284
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,280
very clear about what's the user and

1285
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,200
what's the application

1286
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,520
so from my point of view so that when

1287
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,880
for this the

1288
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,119
for this drop from my point of view you

1289
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,280
to

1290
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,200
you should be thinking about the

1291
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,200
possible difference between the open

1292
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,200
internet and the limited domain

1293
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,960
so um if you remember i think at the

1294
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,200
last iab open meeting we actually had a

1295
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,960
presentation about this draft and we had

1296
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,800
a bit of discussion there and got a lot

1297
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,400
of input that was really good and i

1298
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,040
think a similar comment was made um so

1299
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,640
the last revision of this draft we

1300
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,280
actually updated it to add a little bit

1301
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,880
more text about this

1302
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,640
um you you should probably just read it

1303
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,400
yourself but um i think the

1304
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,079
considerations i personally think and

1305
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,319
i'm an author of that draft um i think

1306
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:17,680
the considerations are not that

1307
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,200
different for limited domains you need

1308
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,119
security also limited domains you have

1309
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,160
to protect um about you know unknown

1310
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,079
attackers that attack your network so i

1311
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,160
don't think there's a huge difference um

1312
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,520
and that's what we're mentioning in the

1313
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,520
draft but i mean please have a look and

1314
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,520
provide more feedback um and start a

1315
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,440
discussion on the architecture discuss

1316
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,240
mailing list i think

1317
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,920
okay

1318
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,119
thank you

1319
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,440
wes

1320
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,280
thanks i just wanted to follow on a

1321
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,040
little bit about uh russ's great comment

1322
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,160
of the iab meetings are all open except

1323
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,440
for executive session and that's the

1324
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,280
part that i wanted to talk to talk about

1325
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,040
we have almost nothing in executive

1326
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,480
session and i know i talked to somebody

1327
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,800
a year or two ago that thought you know

1328
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,559
we always go straight into executive

1329
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,640
session and that is that is we spent

1330
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,040
like maybe five minutes and it's only

1331
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,800
when we're looking at background

1332
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,480
information for people we're going to

1333
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,559
appoint or comments that you know when

1334
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,040
we collect public feedback that is about

1335
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,920
it uh we're we've actually had almost no

1336
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,839
executive sessions for the past

1337
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:18,880
three years that i've been on the

1338
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,760
interview yeah i can assure you that if

1339
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,280
you if you're missing the executive

1340
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,720
station you're only missing the boring

1341
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,440
stuff so no worries there

1342
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,079
spencer again

1343
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,040
i don't think you're supposed to say

1344
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,760
that in front of the uh iab members and

1345
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,359
potential iab uh nominees

1346
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,079
but but but it is true um

1347
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,480
the uh

1348
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,839
the question i was going to ask is

1349
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:49,440
probably uh

1350
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,000
for something that russ was uh

1351
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,559
mentioning about uh

1352
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,040
having documents that the ib would like

1353
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,480
to have help on

1354
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,880
and

1355
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,880
i i'm a little curious about uh two

1356
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,559
things one is kind of

1357
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,400
uh how we would know that uh and number

1358
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,200
two is is there a is there an obvious

1359
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,359
time for us to

1360
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,400
try to be helpful

1361
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,119
you know like often the often the

1362
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,559
notices i will see are

1363
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,839
for ib

1364
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,640
call for comments on adoption

1365
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,960
or something like that i mean but i'm up

1366
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,720
a little vague on

1367
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,920
how we

1368
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,319
how the people could who could help

1369
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:37,760
would know that

1370
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,040
they

1371
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,640
should be helping and should be helping

1372
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,879
now

1373
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,079
and maybe so i mean i think your

1374
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,440
question is really good but maybe i also

1375
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,760
want to preamble this so when we publish

1376
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,520
the document on the ib stream it's also

1377
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,200
kind of an opinion piece from the iab

1378
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,960
right so we're looking for a lot of

1379
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,960
input because the iab has some smart

1380
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,480
people but we don't know everything and

1381
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,920
and we don't want to miss important

1382
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,920
stuff right but at some point it's it's

1383
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,079
also um you know what the ib thinks is

1384
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,680
the right advice to the community russ

1385
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,280
you wanted to say something

1386
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,520
yeah i was just going to say yeah and

1387
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,440
you know if you attended some of the

1388
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,880
technical sessions you'd see some of the

1389
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,880
stuff we were working on and maybe get

1390
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,800
involved a bit sooner than when it's

1391
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,839
published

1392
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,760
and i don't really know of another good

1393
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,960
way of

1394
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,040
um or just look at the meeting minutes

1395
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,559
from the old meeting minutes and look at

1396
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,079
some of the stuff we're working on you

1397
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:27,119
don't have to attend the meeting

1398
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,280
necessarily just say oh yeah i see the

1399
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,839
ib talked about blah blah blah they

1400
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,520
might be doing a document there let me

1401
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,079
go find out

1402
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,000
so um just from the process point of

1403
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,920
view for a couple of years already we

1404
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,440
have two steps where we actually reach

1405
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,680
out to the explicitly we reach out to

1406
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,680
the community one is before we adopt a

1407
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,400
document as an ib document that's what

1408
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,400
what the passing document is right now

1409
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,839
so this is an early stage and this is a

1410
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,200
really good point to provide a lot of

1411
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,960
input because that's where we can still

1412
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,960
scope and change the document and the

1413
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,720
other one is very very late just because

1414
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,800
before we um start want to publish the

1415
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,000
document so that's the point where the

1416
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,079
document is basically done and if you

1417
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:05,680
have a severe concern we might still

1418
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,040
consider it but we're not planning to

1419
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,040
change the document but we do have these

1420
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,280
two points in the in the process where

1421
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,880
you can easily engage

1422
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,559
and between those two points or even

1423
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,319
before that first point we try to

1424
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,079
actually bring it to this meeting here

1425
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,920
because that's where we have discussion

1426
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,800
time with the community

1427
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,720
thank you all

1428
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,759
have a great itf

1429
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,440
uh robin

1430
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,839
in fact you know i'm not sure that if

1431
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,520
you have this talk to the community uh

1432
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,079
about the point or not in fact i think

1433
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,520
that's the ib meeting that is open and

1434
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,200
now that's the uh every month the uh the

1435
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,400
fourth

1436
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,800
week we will have a

1437
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,800
dedicated meeting for the technical

1438
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,440
discussion we wish that the community

1439
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,599
members can bring that's an interesting

1440
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,200
topic to the ib so that we can help

1441
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,680
to schedule this wow we can have some

1442
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,240
the discussion in the ib this is the

1443
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,960
meeting open meeting so that's that's my

1444
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,440
suggestion okay

1445
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,040
yeah definitely if you if you have

1446
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,559
topics and that's another purpose of

1447
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,240
this meeting if you have topic that you

1448
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,400
think the iab should consider please

1449
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,960
bring it to us

1450
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,800
so and now i think we actually reached

1451
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,480
the end of the queue and we can just

1452
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,160
stop a few minutes early here i don't

1453
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,079
think anybody would be too sorry about

1454
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,280
that

1455
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,480
um

1456
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,800
so in that thanks thank you everybody

1457
