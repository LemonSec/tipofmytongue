[Music]

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,960
i think you've seen this thing i'm not

27
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,960
going to bother reading it

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,240
out to you

29
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,920
and this is the other half so

30
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,240
and here's the new thing

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,640
living with this coc we're not going to

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,240
read that one out to you either but um

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,320
we've been asked to

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,920
all working roof chairs have been asked

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,640
to

36
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,320
display these things

37
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,799
at the start of meetings this is not any

38
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,880
commentary on

39
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,960
the dynamics of this particular group

40
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,479
which we think

41
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,720
are just fine

42
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,840
so

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,200
hopefully you've read this and if not

44
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,000
please do so now

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,800
and follow it

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,920
so

47
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,980
with that we can proceed to the agenda

48
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,290
[Music]

49
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,440

and as for jet prescribe we usually

58
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,760
don't need those in

59
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,840
virtual meetings but just in case i am

60
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,319
following the jabber room so

61
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,599
if you

62
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,519
want anything relayed in

63
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,400
on the

64
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,720
well room mic whatever that means here

65
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,840
and just prefix it with mick and we will

66
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,400
read it out

67
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,680
so

68
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,800
um

69
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,480
we'll have the

70
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,840
um

71
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,319
traditional document update and followed

72
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,239
by presentations for dta node id ari

73
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,239
integration subdomains

74
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,400
and then if we have time any other

75
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,680
business

76
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,560
any agenda bashing

77
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,319
okay not only

78
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,879
not in the job room either

79
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,120
so

80
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,760
with that we can go to document update

81
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,959
so

82
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:49,920
we have

83
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,599

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,880
sections whereas it was just

105
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,520

the list that one review but well buy a

118
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,520

120
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,320

two updates of dtn node id

123
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,240
we have ongoing discussions with roman

124
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,639
and they have a presentation so

125
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,800

131
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,680

anything i missed

136
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,080
okay

137
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,000
and with that we can go to the

138
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,360
presentation

139
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,280
hey yo i just wanted to kind of repeat

140
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,960
our working plan

141
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,440
we have one of the tn auth documents the

142
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,199
auth token documents and last call we

143
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,960
have the other one through last call but

144
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,120
we've had it parked now for a number of

145
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,319
months waiting for the other one so when

146
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,440
the

147
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,919
when uh when the authority token draft

148
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,919
drops out of itf last call i'll be

149
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,440
batching both of them and bringing them

150
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,240
to the isg

151
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,280
okay

152
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,880
so

153
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,120
with that it's time for the dtn node id

154
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,600
draft and

155
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,100
i should have written

156
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,639
[Music]

157
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,080
who's doing them

158
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,000
right i guess yeah

159
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,680
so uh

160
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,000
could you uh do you want to

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,280
control the slides by yourself

162
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,919
you can if you click the little paper

163
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,758
icon you can there you go you did it

164
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
perfect

165
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,319
i think someone needs to authorize oh

166
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,639
there it goes

167
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,960
great

168
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,520
um this is uh gonna be short which is

169
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,840
good

170
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,400
and

171
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,240
so there were

172
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,039
two

173
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,840
updates two document updates but one set

174
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,919
of updates

175
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,919
since the last ietf and version04

176
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,160
and they're mostly related to the

177
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,240
profile that this

178
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,680
validation method is supporting the

179
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,199
certificate profile

180
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,599
so the dtn's tcpcl document

181
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,199
is now

182
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,759
almost in the off 48 state

183
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,560
and thanks to russ

184
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,800
hussley and others

185
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,560
we were able to

186
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,240
get that document into a

187
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,560
a good state with um

188
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,080
a new

189
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,000
um

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,639
subject alternative name uh oid

191
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,479
allocation

192
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,560
and that is now reflected in the acme

193
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,919
draft so before where it was using the

194
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,160
uri san form it is now using a specific

195
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,680
bundle eid

196
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,039
san

197
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,879
and um

198
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,360
so that was really a search and replace

199
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,599
in the the acme document just using a

200
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,919
different certificate field and using a

201
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,199
different

202
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,759
acme identifier name to relate to that

203
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,519
field

204
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,519
then there was another change that was

205
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,360
made to clarify multi-perspective

206
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,200
validation

207
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,719
to really make it

208
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,039
a first class

209
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,680
use of this validation method

210
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,519
in the same way that

211
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,399
the htp and dns allow multi-perspective

212
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,480
validation and provide some guidance

213
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,360
about

214
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,880
how to do that and requirements about

215
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,640
what must be done in that case

216
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,560
there was a clarification of the the

217
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,080
node id definition to be able to uh

218
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,399
just make sure that the acme server is

219
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,480
doing the right

220
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,560
logic in the right places

221
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,680
and uh

222
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,560
cleaning up client inputs

223
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,600
and then

224
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,760
the one structural change

225
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,360
was that

226
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,680
the previous version of this document

227
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,760
updated a 2b rfc from the dtn working

228
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,519
group and those updates have been now

229
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,360
moved into a separate document that's

230
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,240
awaiting the dtn working groups

231
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,440
adoption

232
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,120
uh that will be discussed uh tomorrow

233
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,240
actually

234
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,279
and

235
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,399
so

236
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,560
this acme document now is purely uh acme

237
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,360
and it's also at the experimental level

238
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,920
just because this is new behavior

239
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,240
whereas the other updating document is

240
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,560
at the

241
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,399
standards level

242
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,640
and then there still are three remaining

243
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,080
typo level

244
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,600
issues in the document

245
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,399
that i was waiting on

246
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,920
after the itf

247
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,519
one of them is a must not accidentally

248
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,800
change to a must that was a search and

249
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,720
replace problem

250
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,800
trying to claim the document

251
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,320
there still are two

252
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,800
uses of the uri name in the iana

253
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,720
registrations that that need to be

254
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,560
replaced by bundled eid

255
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,399
that's a simple fix also

256
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,880
and then the example bundles in appendix

257
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,760
b

258
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,040
this is a very minor knit that

259
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,600
they should use a different encoding

260
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,880
form

261
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,519
for um the array a definite versus

262
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,079
indefinite form in sibor terms

263
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,760
which is also it doesn't affect the

264
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,000
interpretation it just affects the

265
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,160
encoding form so it's very minor and

266
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,200
then one last open question this is just

267
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,240
in terms of the acme document um

268
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,120
for

269
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
for acme purposes

270
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,560
uh right now

271
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,160
the term dtn node id is used

272
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,880
but

273
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,240
in the parlance of of dtn itself it's

274
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,000
just called a node id

275
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,160
um this

276
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,399
is a little bit different than

277
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,839
the bundle endpoint id eid

278
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,920
so it's just an open question of

279
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,600
uh what makes the most sense for

280
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,200
understanding what's happening dtn node

281
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
id makes it more clear that

282
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,000
it's

283
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,839
a dtn term

284
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,399
but it could potentially be confusing

285
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,600
because

286
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,200
a node id can actually have two

287
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,120
different uri forms an ipn uri or a dtn

288
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,800
uri so dtn

289
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,920
is a little overloaded in that

290
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,959
represents

291
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,240
both the

292
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,560
broad

293
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,800
topic area the working group and a

294
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,880
specific uri form

295
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,040
um i don't have really strong feelings

296
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,560
about this either way it's it's purely a

297
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,079
terminology and

298
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,079
making sure that people understand what

299
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,000
is being referred to

300
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,839
other than just saying node id

301
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,720
and that's all i have

302
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,360
on this topic

303
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,639
so

304
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,639
questions

305
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,920
how are you planning to resolve the last

306
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,079
one

307
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,519
uh

308
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,120
for the moment uh

309
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,279
leaving it as is just calling it a dtn

310
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,639
node id so it's it's just qualifying

311
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,320
dtn as in

312
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,120
the working group in the topic area not

313
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,560
anything else

314
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,160
i just noticed that

315
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,800
in other cases the eid is called a

316
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,160
bundle eid and this is where uh

317
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,360
the reason why it came up is because i

318
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,040
was looking at the

319
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,240
um

320
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,800
uh the the challenge types and

321
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,760
like

322
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,360
the other challenge types aren't really

323
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,240
qualified in the same way the email

324
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,480
challenge type is just called email that

325
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,720
the dns is just called dns

326
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,519
um

327
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,320
so

328
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
this one's a little bit

329
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
different in that the name is qualified

330
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,880
dtn node id and not just

331
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,800
node id

332
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,040
but it makes no difference other than

333
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,760
extra characters

334
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,890
[Music]

335
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,839
anything else anyone joining the

336
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,880
queue eric

337
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,440
but as i was reading this draft and

338
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,120
providing feedback on things like the

339
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,279
multi-perspective it was

340
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,360
very helpful to me to have

341
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,680
dtn node id every single time it's just

342
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,399
like right it's just you that i as an

343
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,920
acme person don't need to fully

344
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,279
understand

345
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,360
like i i could sort of encapsulate it

346
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,639
and so that

347
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,199
that nomenclature worked well for me for

348
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,680
whatever that's worth

349
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,920
okay so i'm reading from um

350
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,760
roman in the chat that um

351
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,600
assuming everything is

352
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,720
resolved and fixed it could be

353
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,519
in the chat as soon as december 2nd so

354
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,839
so i think that's for the

355
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,320
for the star drafts

356
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,639
yeah that's right that was my comments

357
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,440
you're exactly right yeah or for the

358
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,160
authority token draft so the etn

359
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,839
after we get this straightforward thing

360
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,440
resolved thank you for all the edits

361
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,160
brian uh we can go last call and so

362
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,760
that's that's gonna be at least two week

363
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,519
delay so i haven't looked at the

364
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,600
calendar i think the december

365
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,399
16th telechat is more realistic

366
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,040
yeah that's fine

367
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,839
good um so we might even have another

368
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,480
rfc by

369
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,279
by next itf

370
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,920
the the only thing that would uh hold up

371
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,560
the final approval is that

372
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,959
this document now relies on the dtn

373
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,560
working group document which has not yet

374
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,320
been adopted so they would end up

375
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,519
needing to be in the same cluster

376
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,959
in the editor's

377
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,770
queue

378
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,040
[Music]

379
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,120
well yeah clusters in the editors queue

380
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,279
are

381
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,839
a known

382
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,650
issue so that's the only complexity

383
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,800
[Music]

384
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,320
okay

385
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,519
so there's nothing else and

386
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,120
thank you

387
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,800
and

388
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,120
next up is aaron with the ari

389
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,160
can you

390
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,880
do the sharing thing

391
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,759
um i think the slides are up

392
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,759
yep yeah

393
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,360
awesome fantastic uh so

394
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,399
this

395
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,519
draft is uh completely new from acme or

396
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,720
from ietf 111 i did give a presentation

397
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,880
about it at the interim but i think we

398
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,519
had a slightly smaller group there

399
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,639
uh so

400
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,800
hopefully folks have have read this

401
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,880
draft i'm not gonna be going over the

402
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,759
entire thing like i did at the interim

403
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,519
uh

404
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,440
since that acne interim i've published a

405
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,920
new version version zero one of the

406
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,680
draft uh

407
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,279
i'll go over what's in that in just a

408
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,480
moment uh we've deployed an initial

409
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,959
server implementation in let's encrypt

410
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,959
staging environment so

411
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,160
uh code which implements uh this draft

412
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,839
spec is

413
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,519
uh written and deployed it's not

414
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,680
particularly intelligent yet but it does

415
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,040
work and it does abide by the draft

416
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,399
and an initial client implementation

417
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,959
in cert bot has been has

418
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,480
been begun

419
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,000
but is not yet actually landed in cert

420
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,800
bot uh trunk so

421
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,799
that piece is still in progress

422
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,760
uh

423
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,400
changes since uh

424
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,959
version 0 that was presented at the

425
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,720
interim uh

426
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,520
the

427
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,359
based on feedback from that interim

428
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,559
meeting the renewal info url is now

429
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,720
directly constructable from the

430
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,480
subscriber certificate i'll go over that

431
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,559
in more detail in just a minute other

432
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,079
smaller changes

433
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,160
uh get is now the only supported

434
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,320
protocol the majority of the acme

435
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,600
endpoints uh require post as get uh even

436
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,960
for item potent get like things

437
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,840
but we don't have to follow that with

438
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,080
new extensions to the acme protocol with

439
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,640
with new endpoints being added and

440
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,400
practical experience has shown that

441
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,840
that's actually kind of a pain because

442
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,480
it makes caching really difficult and so

443
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,919
for things that don't require any

444
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,400
authentication there's no need to carry

445
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,880
that forward and so this says hey

446
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,799
we're only going to use get

447
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,679
um

448
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,600
i've added small pieces of clarifying

449
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,280
behavior for

450
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,799
how clients should behave in certain

451
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,799
circumstances for example

452
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,640
if they don't get a ari response at all

453
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,320
if they get a malformed

454
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,720
ari response

455
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,280
if they get a response that doesn't mesh

456
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,240
nicely with the frequency at which the

457
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,160
client tends to wake up because as we

458
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,320
know many clients are implemented as

459
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,760
cron jobs not as long-running demons

460
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,919
and a bunch of small formatting cleanups

461
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,400
that are barely worth mentioning

462
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,400
um so the renewal info url

463
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:38,780
uh

464
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,080
[Music]

465
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,400
it used to be in draft zero zero

466
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,360
that

467
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,720
a

468
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,919
finalized order object in addition to

469
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,160
having a here's where you should go

470
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,720
download your certificate from url would

471
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,799
also have a and here's where you should

472
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,799
check for your renewal info url in it so

473
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,600
a acme client would

474
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,520
finalize an order

475
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,400
save that renewal info url

476
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,720
locally somewhere cache it write it to

477
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,960
disk something like that and then would

478
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,160
query that url over and over again um

479
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,200
however feedback that we got said

480
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,080
a caching that url is kind of a pain for

481
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,640
certain kinds of clients and also

482
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,280
external monitoring services would like

483
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,440
to be able to construct these urls

484
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,520
directly and external monitoring

485
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,760
services obviously don't have access to

486
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,200
order objects

487
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,400
so

488
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,600
we've changed it so that the order

489
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,080
resource is now completely untouched and

490
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,360
unchanged

491
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,919
instead we've added a

492
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,000
new field to the directory uh renewal

493
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,640
info listing the base url for the

494
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,080
renewal info resource type so any client

495
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,559
can fetch the directory and see where

496
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,600
renewal info will be surfaced

497
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,919
and then the remainder of the renewal

498
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,600
info url

499
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,480
which is just a

500
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,120
a path blob effectively it could be

501
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,640
query parameters or something like that

502
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,280
but we're going with a path blob for now

503
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,799
uh is constructed from case insensitive

504
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,960
hex encodings of

505
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,000
the sha one hash of the issuer key the

506
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,640
sha1 hash of the issuer name and the

507
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,520
certificate serial number

508
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
these are the same components that we

509
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,559
use for ocsp and in particular mandating

510
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,600
sha-1 hashes is the

511
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,799
uh

512
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,120
oh i'm forgetting the name of the rfc

513
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,520
now but it's the uh

514
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,200
ocsp for resource constrained or for

515
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,880
high volume environments where it

516
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,039
mandates sha-1 instead of

517
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,520
allowing the the client to

518
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,559
specify what hash it's using uh when it

519
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,720
hashes the issue or key an issue or name

520
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,600
so

521
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,520
any client that is capable of requesting

522
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,760
ocsp is capable of constructing these

523
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,320
three parameters and we have

524
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,919
industry-wide acceptance that these

525
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,320
three parameters are sufficient to

526
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,400
uniquely identify a certificate and

527
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,440
therefore

528
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,600
that's what we're going with

529
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,679
for uniquely identifying a certificate

530
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,840
for this renewal info as well

531
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,280
so you make a get request to the renewal

532
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,360
info base path from the directory

533
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,919
concatenated with these three path

534
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,640
elements computed like ocsp

535
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,360
and you get back the same

536
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,240
uh

537
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,840
renewal info

538
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,720
uh

539
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,080
object that the initial draft zero zero

540
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,200
had

541
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,590
um

542
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,360
[Music]

543
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,919
there's still some open questions uh

544
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,240
obviously more questions might arise as

545
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,039
the

546
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,520
initial client implementations are

547
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,720
written and deployed but right now the

548
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,000
known open questions that i would love

549
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,400
feedback for at some point

550
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,440
um

551
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,480
are

552
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,440
one

553
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,280
pulling semantics

554
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,559
right now

555
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,080
as you can see in this response

556
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,120
the renewal info response comes with a

557
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,320
retry after header saying hey

558
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,080
i've given you the renewal info please

559
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,280
don't check back for at least this long

560
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,320
um

561
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,760
but that only gives us half of the

562
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,400
semantics that we actually want we want

563
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
to both say hey please don't check back

564
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,039
for at least for example six hours but

565
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,919
then we also want to say but please

566
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,159
check back as quickly after six hours as

567
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,760
you can because part of the point of

568
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,919
this is that we want clients to be

569
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,799
checking in frequently so they know

570
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,480
instantaneously

571
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,159
if their renewal info suggested renewal

572
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,320
window has been updated

573
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,919
um

574
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,200
so

575
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
thinking about changing the semantics of

576
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,720
this

577
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,080
whether we want to continue doing it

578
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,840
with a header or whether we want to

579
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,360
incorporate

580
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,960
the suggested

581
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,600
polling window into the renewal info

582
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,760
response whether we want to incorporate

583
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,919
it into like the meta section of the

584
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,880
directory or something like that

585
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,760
um so if people have feedback on that i

586
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,559
would love to hear it um

587
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,240
yes i see in chat i see there's been

588
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,039
some discussion in chat i will read that

589
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,000
in more detail momentarily but yes uh

590
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,640
not quite instantaneously but

591
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,440
quickly as quickly as is reasonable

592
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,720
we've been talking about things like on

593
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,200
the order of six hours or one hour

594
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,080
um

595
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,280
the second

596
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,799
consideration is a larger change um

597
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,159
we've been thinking about the idea of

598
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,559
there being a callback endpoint uh

599
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,880
basically a way for clients to say

600
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,320
uh

601
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,480
hey you told me that i should renew this

602
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,240
cert at this time

603
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,400
that's done now

604
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,830
um

605
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,559
[Music]

606
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,720
one reason this would be helpful is

607
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,279
because in the use case that is one of

608
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,960
the motivating use cases for this

609
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,240
extension uh in the use case that is a

610
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,159
ca believes that it is about to revoke a

611
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,200
cert

612
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,159
and it wants to give a subscriber an

613
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,640
opportunity to renew that cert and have

614
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,720
continuity of business before that

615
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,440
certificate is revoked uh

616
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,279
having this sort of callback endpoint

617
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,200
would let the client

618
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,000
say

619
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,159
yes it is safe to revoke this cert now

620
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,200
or would let the ca determine yes i know

621
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,799
it this cert has been replaced it is

622
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,799
okay for me to revoke it now

623
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,120
um

624
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,200
we're still just really thinking about

625
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,960
this we don't know if we definitely want

626
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,240
to do it we don't know what we want it

627
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,159
to look like but i would love discussion

628
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,880
and feedback on how people think this

629
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,240
should look and whether it's worth

630
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,159
incorporating as well

631
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,360
and then

632
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,559
finally

633
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:54,920
uh

634
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,799
[Music]

635
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,120
i don't know how call for adoption works

636
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,400
this is the first

637
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,559
document that i've brought to oregon

638
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,080
group ever uh but after the acme interim

639
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,039
we did have one very kind and generous

640
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,279
soul on the mailing list saying that

641
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,200
they supported a call for adoption and

642
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,240
so i sort of wanted to put that out

643
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,200
there because i don't know how it

644
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,480
actually works

645
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,559
um but yeah that's it for me i would

646
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,120
love to take questions and i will catch

647
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,360
up on the chat over here on the side

648
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,240
so anybody queuing up with questions

649
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,840
yes rich

650
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,000
hiya uh welcome to the itf

651
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,520
um

652
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,320
the uh

653
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,120
recommendation and it can be handled

654
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,919
once if the working group adopts us and

655
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,120
makes changes right just so you know

656
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,039
adoption is means this document's a

657
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,960
starting point right so obviously it's

658
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,679
not frozen

659
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,080
um i don't see any reason not to just

660
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,640
completely lose exactly and calculation

661
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,039
is used for ocsp

662
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,200
uh everyone's got an ocsp thing

663
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,799
particularly in places like let's

664
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,360
encrypt where there's no revocation so i

665
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,840
really strongly encourage that but again

666
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,760
that's more for a post-adoption thing i

667
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,279
think this is nice the document is

668
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,200
pretty well readable

669
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,080
and you did a good job thank you

670
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,240
thank you

671
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,479
yes anyone else

672
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,039
do we want to pull how many you read the

673
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,279
draft

674
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,760
other than which

675
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,949
[Music]

676
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,240
okay so rich read it and michael read it

677
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,840
and i think they considered it right in

678
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,159
the chat right so if you've read it

679
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,279
yeah

680
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,480
chat

681
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,200
rather than running a real poll

682
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
and yeah

683
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,679
so um

684
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,320
i think that's now that it's

685
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,120
been

686
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,760
presented in a real working group

687
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,360
meeting

688
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,799
we can

689
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,320
ask for uh

690
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,640
people to read it today on the

691
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,200
on the list and then do a proper

692
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
adoption call rather than

693
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,840
start it now

694
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,679
[Music]

695
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,080
yeah i'm definitely willing to put

696
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,120
forward a new email on the list

697
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,159
opening

698
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,080
list-based discussion for these two open

699
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,000
questions and then one for adoption as

700
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
well

701
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,760
um

702
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,799
it's good that

703
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,840
people are seeing this

704
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,280
um

705
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,520
[Music]

706
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,919
the chairs will handle the adoption call

707
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,760
you don't have to do that

708
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,120
right

709
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,360
of course

710
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,320
okay

711
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,440
so

712
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,279
if there's nothing else

713
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,080
we can move to owen

714
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,840
all right thank you

715
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,000
thank you

716
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,039
it's actually here

717
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,559
okay

718
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,520
a little paper document thing you can

719
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,559
run your own slides

720
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,600
on your little icon thing there's a

721
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,720
little thing that looks like a piece of

722
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,559
paper

723
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,440
now like the filing old

724
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,200
windows 3 or something

725
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,399
should be up at the top layer

726
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,799
yeah next to the hand icon between the

727
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,480
hand icon and the screen icon

728
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,279
oh you mean just okay so

729
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,799
just click on it here okay i gotta get

730
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,559
so share me on slides you should just

731
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,120
like oh sure okay yeah okay okay yep

732
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,679
i mean it's been there since last time

733
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,919
but it actually works today

734
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,159
okay

735
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,600
this would be really really quick

736
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,320
so draft five of acme integrations

737
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,159
the only changes in stratfor um

738
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,240
russ provided feedback on the mailer for

739
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,159
draft four that was a major issue with

740
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,480
um which we knew we knew about but we

741
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
hadn't addressed um

742
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,960
with roc 70 30 sees our attributes gap

743
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,760
we relied on using that for the

744
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,480
um ra to tell the client

745
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,679
what subject or sound to include um our

746
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,080
c730 doesn't actually allow that so

747
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,640
there is a draft that rich or that might

748
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,480
be presented at lamps

749
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,360
um earlier on this week that will

750
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,559
update rfc 7030 to

751
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,200
specify how csr attributes can be used

752
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,080
by an ra to tell a client

753
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,320
attribute values that it expects to see

754
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,279
included in the csr request

755
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,559
and so

756
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,399
so the integrations draft is now

757
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,480
pointing to the draft and eventually

758
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,240
allow us to

759
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,880
specify how to handle um specifying a

760
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,279
csr attributes value

761
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,120
and terminology change

762
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,640
i just updated some of the terminology

763
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,760
to align more with the rfc

764
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,000
8499 dns terminology draft rather than

765
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,919
to see a browser forum terminology the

766
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,240
reason for that being that this draft

767
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,279
isn't

768
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,320
um

769
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,799
limited to web pki or ca browser use

770
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,159
cases alone

771
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,480
and so it makes sense to align with the

772
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
rfc terminology rather than the ceo

773
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,360
browser technology

774
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,760
and that is it

775
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,519
that's the only update

776
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,600
so we just need some more reviewers

777
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,200
and now that we've addressed one major

778
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,519
issue we can probably well the one major

779
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,039
issue will be addressed once the lamb's

780
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,320
draft progresses

781
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,440
and we'll just ask the group for some

782
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,559
further

783
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,600
reviewers that's it

784
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,120
right so

785
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,360
yes

786
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,399
uh so i think we're gonna see

787
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,080
speedy progress on on that uh csr

788
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,600
attributes uh document but

789
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,399
this one's kinda stalled until we know

790
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,320
what that one's going to say because

791
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,760
right now there's a bunch of

792
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,240
placeholders in that document as opposed

793
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,519
to a full

794
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,039
update right

795
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,919
so my assumption is that that we're

796
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,000
we really can't do a full review of this

797
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,720
until that one uh

798
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,840
gets done

799
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,679
is that right yeah

800
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,000
that's fair yeah the um

801
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,080
and the last draft is a very drafty

802
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
draft

803
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,360
yes

804
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,440
like something needs to go here

805
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,159
drafty yes yes

806
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,880
okay thanks

807
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,480
a minute before we can really do another

808
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,200
discover that it sounds like

809
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,039
well like it is just one section like

810
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,519
there is it's there's one section in the

811
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,559
integrations drafts that refers to csr

812
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,159
attributes draft but i think the rest of

813
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,279
the document the power of that one

814
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,880
section can be reviewed

815
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,320
okay anyone else

816
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,840
okay so

817
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,240
we'll send a message to the list that uh

818
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,039
we really want people to review this

819
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,200
and um

820
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,000
next up is also you so you can switch

821
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,200
here

822
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,039
okay so you can just switch it without

823
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,519
there you go

824
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,279
again this will be a very short update

825
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,840
so it's been changed since

826
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,159
um the previous draft has been adopted

827
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,159
um we've made some terminology additions

828
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,600
not terminology changes we've just

829
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,120
referenced we've included the rrc 8499

830
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,039
and we've also fixed up some editorial

831
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,799
units i think was iron provided a bunch

832
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,960
of knits um on the mirror a while back

833
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,140
we fixed up all those

834
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,159
[Music]

835
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,279
and

836
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,960
the big change really the big thing i

837
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,360
want to discuss really is um

838
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,120
and i think was martin thompson provided

839
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,200
some feedback on the adoption call

840
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,440
mirror and you said well why are we

841
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,720
using

842
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,799
why are we using domain space the name

843
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,480
domain name space and not sub domains

844
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,919
and actually the reason why we changed

845
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,640
that initially was because there was

846
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
um some feedback on the meter that

847
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,640
something means was a bit confusing but

848
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,600
uh

849
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,320
so we changed to domain namespace to be

850
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,760
more prescriptive but it was based on

851
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,918
the ceo browser definitions and i think

852
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,440
similar to active integrations acting

853
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,639
sub domains is not restricted to web pki

854
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,599
or ceo browser use cases so i think it

855
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,679
probably makes sense to um align with

856
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,639
the rfc8499 definitions

857
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,119
and and therefore probably makes sense

858
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,040
to change the

859
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,879
field names in the json objects back to

860
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,239
what you originally were and back to

861
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,639
align with rfc 84.99 so that's that's

862
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,839
the biggest thing that i'd like to

863
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,839
discuss we don't need to discuss it here

864
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,000
um but just some consensus on the mirror

865
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,560
as to which terminology set to lean

866
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,599
towards

867
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,199
i think i'm actually leaning towards rot

868
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,359
84.99 not to see a browser stuff

869
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,599
and that is it that's the last slide

870
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,680
very very quick update the the biggest

871
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,960
so there's no substantive changes

872
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,240
the only thing you need to close on is

873
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,879
terminology

874
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:12,640
[Music]

875
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,760
so i know this is a newly adopted thing

876
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,880
but it's actually a pretty old graph

877
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,720
just stayed

878
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,800
individual for a long time

879
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,240
how far do you think it is from

880
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,560
completion

881
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,720
um

882
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,160
i don't think it's far from for

883
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,760
completion at all

884
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,040
um

885
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,200
it's it's it's it's very close uh like

886
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,480
there's been a lot of discussion on the

887
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,240
mailer over and back

888
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,520
it's been very bursty but a lot of

889
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,640
discussion on the meter about the

890
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,320
details of the draft over the last 18

891
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,280
months

892
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,640
um

893
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,760
so i think it's actually close to

894
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,440
completion but just the terminology is

895
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,200
the one thing that you close on but

896
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,040
leaving the terminology aside i think

897
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,720
the structures of the

898
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,160
the structure of the protocol

899
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,440
enhancements the actual fields we're

900
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,359
adding to the json i think is is pretty

901
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,560
close to complete

902
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,240
we haven't got any substantive feedback

903
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,440
that needs to be changed or what's

904
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,040
currently there apart from maybe

905
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,079
changing terminology

906
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,320
good so

907
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,000
any

908
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,359
anyone else getting in the queue

909
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,000
no okay so um

910
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,359
thank you all

911
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,078
okay thank you

912
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,920
if you stop shining yeah then i can go

913
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,760
back to the

914
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,160
chair slides and i think we're done with

915
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,640
our agenda

916
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,560
okay

917
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,460
so

918
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,320
[Music]

919
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,720
so then the question is do you want to

920
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,759
talk about um

921
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,800
uh what do you call those things

922
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,000
milestones

923
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
that one that's the one

924
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,240
let's start with the if there's any

925
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,040
other

926
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,200
of the business and then real aob okay

927
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,119
we've got 25 minutes so we're probably

928
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,280
going to have time so

929
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,200
anything else please get in the queue

930
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,239
[Music]

931
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,760
okay

932
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,079
it seems like

933
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,240
nothing and nobody

934
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,520
uh there's

935
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,320
one thing about the client certs and we

936
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,280
tried to stir up interests and

937
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,720
well

938
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,839
there was just nothing on the list

939
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,640
it seemed like you were asking for me to

940
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,720
speak with that so um

941
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,040
i have been working with a few people

942
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,520
off list and there should be some text

943
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,760
contributions to expand

944
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,720
the use cases um or i'm sorry not the

945
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,960
use cases the challenge types

946
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,920
for a code signing certificate effort

947
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,920
that has been

948
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,040
um

949
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,599
i guess it was announced um

950
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,839
a few months back but they used their

951
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,079
own method instead of acme and so this

952
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,400
would allow them to switch over to acme

953
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,880
and so not to create yet another

954
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,200
automated certificate

955
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,040
protocol that vendors would have to

956
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,119
support so you should see some more to

957
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,520
come on that and um and this was just

958
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
raised in napa as well one of their use

959
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,359
cases they were trying to figure out a

960
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,079
way to solve um because that effort has

961
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,520
very short uh the code signing cert

962
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,680
effort has very short-lived certificates

963
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,680
like in the matter of seconds

964
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,240
um so that they can only be used once

965
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,960
and um that might work for gene app too

966
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,480
but that's we'll have to see what

967
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,400
happens so you might see more

968
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,560
and and we'll see um

969
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,920
you know obviously the draft should only

970
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,440
go forward if there is real interest but

971
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,119
it seems like

972
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,400
um a widely used effort in the linux

973
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,200
consortium

974
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,440
they are looking to switch over and

975
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,440
extend this draft and use acme as a

976
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,839
result

977
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,400
so that would be a big implementation as

978
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,440
well with many vendors

979
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,680
okay thank you

980
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,760
yep thank you

981
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,200
um

982
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
so now we

983
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,320
i'll stop sharing the slides and

984
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,440
start sharing the milestones

985
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,550
yes

986
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:31,409
[Music]

987
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,119
okay

988
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,640
so um

989
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,280
yeah that's the milestones that we have

990
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,760
and uh

991
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,280
obviously um

992
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,520
all of the milestones that are not

993
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,720
marked as done are marked with uh

994
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,280
dates that are in the past

995
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,319
so

996
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,880
should probably fix the uh

997
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,960
april 2021 of uh delay one network

998
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,280
and

999
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,880
the acme integration

1000
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,680
[Music]

1001
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,560
as for the user client and code signing

1002
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,680
well

1003
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,640
we

1004
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,720
neither submitted it to the isg nor

1005
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,400
abandoned it so

1006
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,920
it's kind of uh

1007
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,359
awaiting uh adoption still

1008
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,640
so

1009
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,560
um

1010
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,319
roman d teddy

1011
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,599
say what you think we should do with

1012
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,760
this

1013
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,720
can we just have people that are

1014
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,240
authoring the drafts pick dates

1015
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,160
that's the kind of recommendation i'd be

1016
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,040
looking for

1017
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,079
[Music]

1018
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,520
yeah i mean i think dpn is uh really

1019
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,670
might as well pick december and uh

1020
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,680
[Music]

1021
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,970
as for the integrations

1022
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:08,400
[Music]

1023
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,720
maybe next march

1024
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,400
and add the subdomains on top of that

1025
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,720
um

1026
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,000
and integration drafts aren't linked

1027
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,400
together are they

1028
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,040
uh no they're not

1029
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,720
so you could do sub domains in

1030
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,839
the spring it sounds like the

1031
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,599
integration draft has a little bit to go

1032
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,359
with the lamps draft

1033
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:34,900
in tandem

1034
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,920
[Music]

1035
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,280
and then maybe

1036
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,839
well it's too early to add them

1037
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,319
a milestone for ari because we haven't

1038
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,839
decided that we want it still but

1039
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,880
um that might be the next

1040
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,319
just before the next itf

1041
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,720
so what um kathleen do you have a date

1042
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,560
when you would expect to see the client

1043
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,160
or code signing thing solidified

1044
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,640
i would expect before the next meeting

1045
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,960
cycle i'm supposed to get texts within

1046
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,720
the next week or two

1047
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,560
from this other effort

1048
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,640
and um

1049
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,240
and i can sync up with the gene app

1050
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,240
folks pretty easily to it to see if

1051
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,680
it works for them once they have a

1052
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,400
little bit more time to review

1053
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,160
uh so i i think by the next meeting we

1054
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,599
should be ready for working group last

1055
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,880
call if there's uh traction and it gets

1056
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,280
used for these use cases

1057
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,359
some might as well set it to july 2022

1058
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,880
yes

1059
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,040
you may as well hopefully

1060
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,560
yeah hopefully we can overshoot it

1061
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,960
because the code for um

1062
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,480
for that other effort is is coming soon

1063
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,880
it's underway so um

1064
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,119
yeah

1065
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,240
okay that sounds like a plan

1066
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,240
i mean are these milestones more than

1067
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,920
just like sticking your finger in the

1068
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,760
air and

1069
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,520
making a guess i mean

1070
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,119
what happens when you i mean obviously

1071
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,440
we've missed them so

1072
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,599
oh you just reset them but i mean you

1073
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,200
try

1074
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,440
um that's why i'm i'm saying i'm hoping

1075
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,200
for working group last call by the next

1076
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,200
meeting but um

1077
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,800
i guess uh

1078
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,839
you have has had experience that says it

1079
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,839
should go longer so

1080
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,040
whatever you want to do is fine i'm

1081
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,880
going to try to overshoot it

1082
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,160
yeah when

1083
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,920
the master is first submitting to the

1084
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,000
isg so that obviously takes a little

1085
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,280
more time than

1086
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,760
just the um

1087
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,280
the work the working group last call

1088
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,200
so

1089
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,319
unless i'm mistaken i think this is all

1090
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,599
we have

1091
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,240
for today

1092
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,760
so

1093
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,760
asking one more time is there anything

1094
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,839
else

1095
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,720
going once going twice

1096
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,800
thank you all for attending the meeting

1097
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,480
and i'll hopefully see you next time

1098
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,520
unless do you want to have an interim

1099
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,640
um that's a

1100
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,079
tough question

1101
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,200
um

1102
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,200
only if we have something very specific

1103
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,480
to discuss

1104
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,760
in the intern

1105
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,400
like if there's a lot more client

1106
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,040
content or something really new about

1107
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,680
aeri that comes up in

1108
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,520
in a potential adoption call

1109
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,439
okay

1110
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,839

1111
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,640
