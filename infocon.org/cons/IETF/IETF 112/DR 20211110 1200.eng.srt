okay

19
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,879
let us get started good morning

20
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,879
everybody or good afternoon where you

21
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,920
may be

22
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,480
uh welcome to idr for

23
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,040
ietf 112. uh before we get ourselves

24
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,959
started we see that sri rama's uh

25
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,800
showing his hand up in the virtual

26
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,000
no hand cue

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,879
did you have something to add

28
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,480
it was by accident

29
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,840
it's okay you've proven your microphone

30
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,599
works

31
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,800
okay so

32
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,480
we are working off of the pre-shared

33
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,319
slides so hopefully this will be nice

34
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,239
and stable

35
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,560
a few quick administrative points early

36
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,959
this morning uh you know the ietf note

37
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,480
well this is something that each of you

38
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,760
have agreed to

39
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,080
as part of participating in iatf you

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,840
will see this uh not only as part of

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,519
your conference materials

42
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,440
but ideally as part of every one of our

43
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,800
slide decks

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,319
um

45
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,599
if you're looking for

46
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,280
you know details about what each of

47
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,120
these things mean now here are some

48
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,599
links to each of the individual bcps

49
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,440
covering these things you are bound by

50
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,560
them

51
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,159
a specific thing

52
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,000
that we are getting a little bit of

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,400
additional emphasis on as part of this

54
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,280
ietf is the iesg has

55
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,040
requested that we remind everybody that

56
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,519
ietf does have a code of contact and

57
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,959
specifically it also has an

58
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,879
anti-harassment policy

59
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,360
and if you find that for some reason

60
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,599
that you are experiencing inappropriate

61
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,560
behaviors in ietf uh please contact you

62
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,599
know the itf chair or ideally one of the

63
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,280
ombudsmans

64
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,480
um

65
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,000
in general the the things that we

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,480
emphasize are what a friend of mine used

67
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,599
to call kindergarten skills we expect us

68
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,159
to treat everybody with respect

69
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,640
ideally speak slowly and limit used to

70
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,879
slang we're very international community

71
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,560
and english is a terrible language

72
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,120
please make sure that you use good logic

73
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,238
dispute arguments no with no reason

74
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,680
use good engineering judgment and

75
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
ideally look for solutions that are best

76
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,880
for the whole of the internet

77
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,560
so

78
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,040
quick status for the working group

79
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,680
uh since ietf 111 we've received

80
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,160
published several rfcs a couple of them

81
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,080
on bhp ls

82
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,360
specifically the segment routing

83
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,199
extensions

84
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,520
extension specifically for egress pure

85
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,639
engineering

86
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,520
and also the extended attribute groups

87
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,919
we also published the optimal reflection

88
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,560
uh rfc this is a document that has taken

89
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,240
a long time for us to get out and you

90
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,400
know happy to see it actually hit rfc

91
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,600
status

92
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,160
and we also published the flowspec

93
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,199
guidelines for basically relaxed

94
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,120
verification of addresses this is

95
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,440
commonly used at service providers and

96
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,840
it was a very important thing for us to

97
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,160
do a thing that happened outside of idea

98
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,080
but very relevant to our work is the

99
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,479
routing working group i published the

100
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,880
ietf yang policy module this will be

101
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,600
heavily used by the bgb yang module that

102
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,680
we're working on

103
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,360
thank you everyone who actually you know

104
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,120
did that work it was a very tricky bit

105
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,759
of modeling

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,360
so

107
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,560
specifically adopted recent work we have

108
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
draftly srv6 this is work that will be

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,680
getting done under the

110
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,479
umbrella of flow spec v2 based on our

111
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,919
prior discussions

112
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,919
and draft dollar

113
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,639
pgp ls service segments has been adopted

114
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,800
as well

115
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,479
other documents that are of interest is

116
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,039
bhp open policy has been submitted isg

117
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,520
for publication and is working through

118
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,240
iatf last call stuff i do see that we

119
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,120
have

120
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,560
some response back and forth that we

121
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,360
need to do with the ads on the things

122
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,960
um

123
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,639
77-52

124
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,080
you know bhp ls is going through biz and

125
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,240
ketan has responded to you know my

126
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,600
shepard comments

127
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,479
uh we're at the process of quickly

128
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,960
iterating as itf week is progressing and

129
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,560
hopefully we'll have that resolved by

130
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,319
end of week

131
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,280
the srte policy module is uh waiting for

132
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,880
a shepherd write up

133
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,759
and full spec rpd similarly is finished

134
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,160
with the least working group last call

135
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,400
i was waiting on a consensus call on

136
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,440
write up

137
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,280
care i think you had that one but what

138
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,000
is the status in rpd

139
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,039
and here we see your microphone lip at

140
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,199
no voice

141
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,000
sorry about that can you hear me

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,639
oh super um having some audio problems

143
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,039
at my end um it has finished up the

144
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,960
working group last call and it's waiting

145
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,599
for the shepherd writer right

146
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,599
okay so consensus has been declared then

147
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,599
thank you

148
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,160
okay and the last of the list here is

149
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
that the bhp extended community registry

150
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,000
has uh you know finished as working

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,720
through ietf last call and i don't think

152
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,840
we're seeing much in the way of comments

153
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,759
there hopefully that will be published

154
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,319
very quickly

155
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,039
so we had a couple of interim meetings

156
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,840
uh september 27th we had a intro on

157
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,440
flowspec v2

158
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,960
and the

159
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,440
pattern of that was we discussed the

160
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,120
functional contents for the upcoming

161
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,639
flowspec v2

162
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,720
spent some time discussing the problem

163
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,800
space for incremental deployment

164
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,440
and we also got a presentation on this

165
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,120
or v6 that we were talking about in the

166
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,800
prior slide

167
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,639
um the next set of actions that we'll

168
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,479
have there is to complete a first

169
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,520
revision of the flowspec v2 document and

170
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,599
resume discussion the mailing list

171
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,000
there's also some discussion about uh

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,680
doing an interim some time later we'll

173
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,400
talk about that in a moment

174
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,800
we had scheduled a interim specifically

175
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,440
for the bhp class will transport and

176
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,520
colorware routing proposals

177
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,759
this got cancelled due to conflicts by

178
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,360
the document authors

179
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,559
and we're hoping to reschedule that

180
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,120
auto configuration did have a

181
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,719
interim and we review the configuration

182
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,399
design team requirements

183
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,880
uh robert brescia did a

184
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,160
presentation on auto discovery when ixp

185
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,440
and

186
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,959
turned out to not be necessarily

187
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,480
appropriate for data center context but

188
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,959
it did extend on our work that we know

189
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,120
that auto configuration state

190
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,760
will pop up in many other contexts as we

191
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,839
start pushing it forward as a feature

192
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,720
so it was a good presentation to have

193
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,000
in the

194
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,640
layer two space we had a presentation of

195
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,519
the l3dl proposal by randy bush that was

196
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,480
a review of the prior proposal

197
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,680
we also had an

198
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,560
updated proposal from shiva from juniper

199
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
for draft minto

200
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,519
and uh is a non-auto-discovery feature

201
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,440
since we had time during the interim

202
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,320
aishwaren uh did a review of the current

203
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,120
the forum of epnrf and uh

204
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,240
company would

205
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,640
absolutely uh love to have no feedback

206
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,760
on the mailing list about their proposal

207
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,480
our next step for auto configuration is

208
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
that we are probably at the point of

209
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,440
beginning protocol selection discussion

210
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,959
uh although there's again some

211
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,200
discussion about perhaps having

212
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
additional interims to maybe advance the

213
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,040
work a little bit further

214
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,680
we currently have a interim scheduled

215
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,399
for december 6th and december 13th i

216
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,080
believe sue has also recently added a

217
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,800
possible option for november 30th

218
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,079
these are dates that are all just

219
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,680
getting them into the idea of you know

220
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,519
calendaring system

221
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,240
uh the topics that we're looking to have

222
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,000
interim discussions about to try to

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,480
advance the work out of the ietf meeting

224
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,800
cycle you know specifically the beach

225
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,959
bct and car

226
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,240
we're definitely in need of working

227
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
group discussion on these topics since

228
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,600
they're going to be no important things

229
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,440
for the industry

230
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,440
clearly we have the existing work for

231
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,519
flowspec v2 and autoconf

232
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,600
and no this also gives us opportunity to

233
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,360
discuss things uh

234
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,440
as part of just simply advancing things

235
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,000
outside of ietf meeting cycles

236
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,760
we'll be you know doing coordination

237
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,200
with the document authors to find

238
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,760
acceptable dates uh we do realize that

239
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,839
end of year is a challenging time in

240
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,399
terms of people's holiday schedules

241
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,519
so

242
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,040
we'll be doing what we can to you know

243
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,160
be most accommodating

244
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,920
a uh brief status update uh is

245
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,880
on the php yang module uh mahesh did

246
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,560
manage to get know some advancement of

247
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,920
the work you know since uh the last ietf

248
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,399
so please take a look at the diff there

249
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,480
um

250
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,079
just checking to see if mesh was joined

251
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,320
he does not appear to be uh the authors

252
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,160
are intending to try to actually push

253
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,920
you know for functional completion of

254
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,079
the document by your end this has been

255
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,240
tricky work just simply getting you know

256
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,399
the contents of bgp in there being you

257
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,480
know a large protocol with a number of

258
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,680
extensions

259
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,320
and a lot of need for

260
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,880
you know maintainability the work

261
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,360
the stuff that's going in the bhp module

262
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,600
not only heavily leverages things based

263
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,480
on

264
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,399
you know as an example the routing

265
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,800
configuration module and the policy

266
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
module that's been recently published

267
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,120
but we'll also be providing the

268
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,959
fundamentals for things like several of

269
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,880
the vpn models to use later on and

270
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,240
extend

271
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,760
things like maintenance extended

272
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,440
communities

273
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,000
there is a open github on this uh the

274
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,240
authors do welcome you know contribution

275
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,240
towards working on the issues

276
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,160
uh and that said we're just hoping to

277
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,480
have this done by end of year

278
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,639
we are going to need help for impartial

279
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,560
reviewers because you know over the

280
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
lifetime of the document everybody that

281
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,240
has been asked to help work on it has

282
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,680
become a working chair and we'll need to

283
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,040
get other people to take a look at it

284
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,959
a topic worth flagging individually

285
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,160
is the bgb multicast work

286
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,600
we're seeing a number of documents

287
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,800
crossing a number of working groups

288
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,000
that are

289
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
overlapping from our perspective at

290
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,480
least no bgp and multicast type

291
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,639
technologies

292
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,519
these

293
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,200
you know things are crossing between

294
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,240
primarily you know bess and ivr although

295
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,160
some of the work now reaches into no

296
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,360
beer

297
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,000
spring and uh you know

298
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
motivated in many cases by no work that

299
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,600
started the pym group you can see a list

300
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,800
of some of the documents on the right

301
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,959
hand side

302
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,120
there is procedural overlap you did see

303
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,000
a recent post from jeffrey jung from

304
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,480
juniper no mentioning why his specific

305
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,360
document is targeted for its idr

306
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,440
versus some of the work that's in best

307
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
uh the mess and ivr chairs are in

308
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,920
communication about this and

309
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
also with ads and trying to figure out

310
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,760
how we best motivate review and

311
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,560
coordination on the documents minimally

312
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,399
we'll be having cross-working group

313
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,040
review you know and exactly which group

314
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,800
ends up adopting a specific piece of

315
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,880
work is you know the thing that we

316
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,279
figure out as we go along

317
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,240
one of the things that makes this a

318
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,120
little bit challenging is that spring is

319
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,720
not chartered to do multicast work

320
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,320
really

321
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,480
so this is to some extent

322
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,839
pushing some of the work outside of

323
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,160
spring

324
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,839
so that is the

325
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,160
cherished content we are currently still

326
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,000
on time

327
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,760
we'll pause just a moment here to see if

328
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,839
we have any agenda bashing before we

329
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,279
proceed with our first presentation

330
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,800
which will be on

331
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,240
sr policy extensions for ifit

332
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
and joel points out on chat that spring

333
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,600
is not chartered to modify bgp

334
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,120
and many of us are thankful for that

335
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,240
okay

336
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,760
okay so let us move on to our first

337
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,240
presentation scheduled for no five

338
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,320
minutes

339
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,519
hello everybody come here me

340
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,000
we can hear you okay good

341
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,880
um

342
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,600
yeah this is a quick update about the

343
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,320
dgps policy extensions for repeat so

344
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,639
next slide

345
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,800
just

346
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,560
just a recap on background and

347
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,800
motivation so i think refers to uh data

348
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,560
plane on patellar techniques

349
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,240
specifically

350
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,639
in c2im and alternate martin are the

351
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,399
relevant methodologies we are

352
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,920
discussing here

353
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,279
um

354
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,920
you know that anademic informed about

355
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,320
candidate part by using bgp there is the

356
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,240
relevant document in ibr

357
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,399
the segment routing key policy document

358
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,000
that

359
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,600
you also explained that

360
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,320
is

361
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,000
in

362
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,040
publication phase so it's quite advanced

363
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,880
in itf

364
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,519
and these documents simply complement

365
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,320
the segment routing key policy

366
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,040
draft in order to add the extensions to

367
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,839
distribute as a nasa policy carrying

368
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:38,839
ifit

369
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,279
information this way

370
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,199
data plane particularly can be enabled

371
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,120
enabled automatically

372
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,600
that's why

373
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,920
yeah just a few words about the lattice

374
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,040
changes

375
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,839
we

376
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,120
specify the application to

377
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,759
control a domain this is a strong

378
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,240
requirement that was also discussed

379
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,759
in other working groups like six months

380
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,440
about because the

381
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,839
data plane

382
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,800
documents uh

383
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,720
such as the alternate marketing document

384
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,959
inversion c2i and document

385
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,120
and the this application is done

386
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,440
according to

387
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,399
rfc8799 that

388
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,839
for

389
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,240
this kind of application it is suggested

390
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,480
it is recommended to limit the

391
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,720
application to control a domain

392
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
and we also improve the security

393
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,360
consideration sections

394
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,279
based on

395
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,600
this kind of requirement of this kind of

396
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,440
recognition

397
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,800
about the limited administrative domain

398
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,319
application so next

399
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,360
yeah this is about how

400
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,240
dfit attributes are encoding in the sr

401
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,320
policy so

402
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,839
starting from

403
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:56,720
the

404
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,160
segment routing t policy draft

405
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,759
we simply add the ifit attribute that

406
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,319
that can be attached at the candidate

407
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,599
that level as a subtilis and we define

408
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,799
uh five subtleties for

409
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,160
uh in bandwagon c2im for alternate

410
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,599
marking

411
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,240
next slide

412
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,839
in this slide you have the list of the

413
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,000
subtleties for in c20m

414
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,280
of course they are done according to the

415
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,640
relevant in c2im uh document

416
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,520
that is also progressing in ippm next

417
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,840
slide

418
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,520
and this is about the

419
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,840
subtleties for alternate marking this is

420
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,160
also done according to the relevant data

421
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,840
plane document such as one in six man

422
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,039
that is in isg evaluation

423
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,240
uh next slide i think is the last one

424
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,960
yeah so this as uh as i said this

425
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,600
document simply complements the

426
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,799
sr policy operation described in segment

427
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,280
rounding key policy draft by adding the

428
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,039
effect attributes

429
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,559
since the segment routing t policy

430
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,200
document got working group consensus and

431
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,640
this

432
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,400
we're waiting for right up so we can

433
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,720
also consider to progress with this

434
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,559
document as well since

435
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,679
it is strictly related to the other one

436
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,799
so

437
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,840
that's all

438
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,600
welcome question comment thank you

439
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,960
okay we're ending on time and have a

440
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,320
time for a couple brief questions if

441
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,559
there's any

442
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,080
okay there appear to be no questions

443
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,360
thank you giuseppe oh actually one

444
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,799
moment

445
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,120
okay

446
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,760
i'm sorry guys joining for the next

447
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,919
presentation again thank you

448
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,919
okay

449
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,200
hello can you help me

450
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,840
we can hear you

451
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,679
okay thank you this is janka from huawei

452
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,039
my topic is bgp as a policy extension

453
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:39,760
for

454
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,280
template

455
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,559
next slide please

456
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,400
as we know bgp can be used to propagate

457
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,880
the asset policy candidate path to the

458
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,360
head and the nodes in the network

459
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,480
and the bgpsr policy encoding structure

460
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,559
is as follows

461
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,280
in in this structure the basic

462
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,440
attributes of the kind of candidate

463
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,360
paths are defined

464
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,760
in this draft

465
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,960
next slide please

466
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,159
but in application the head note routers

467
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,799
may need to enable many features on the

468
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,240
candidate path

469
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,960
for example in this scenario

470
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,840
there are there are two candidate passes

471
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,559
in this sr policy

472
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,559
one path is

473
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,080
to be used as the primary path pass

474
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,600
and with the with the preference 100

475
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,559
the other path is to be used as a backup

476
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,760
backup pass and has a preference

477
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,960
200

478
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,400
and the the features for the two parts

479
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,919
are different

480
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,400
for the primary parts

481
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,600
we need a backup backup as needed

482
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,120
seamless

483
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,120
bad direction or forwarding detector

484
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,280
needed and the bfd minimum transport

485
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,159
transportation interval is 10 sec 10

486
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,679
milliseconds

487
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,320
and also the traffic statistics is

488
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,760
needed but for the backup path

489
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,280
the bfd

490
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,039
minimum transfer transfer interval is

491
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,960
20 milliseconds

492
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,159
so it's the tool path has the different

493
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,080
features

494
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,120
now we can use the template to describe

495
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,840
these features

496
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,799
so there are this is the benefits

497
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,159
to use the

498
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,840
template first

499
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,919
some features are only meaningful to

500
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,559
controller and head and nose bgp

501
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,120
protocol known in the two nozom

502
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,840
so we used use the template can show the

503
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,440
information

504
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,000
that bgp no need to know

505
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,039
second features maintained if frequently

506
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,520
template can be used to avoid the bdp

507
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,159
protocol changes too frequently

508
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,840
and

509
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,039
so the different as a policies with the

510
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,919
same feature can use the same template

511
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,120
thus can

512
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,960
simplify configuration and improve

513
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,760
maintainability

514
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,960
next slide please

515
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,640
so we use we can use a template for

516
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,320
example

517
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,280
we can configure two templates on the

518
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,440
router and then

519
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,520
we can use the controller to download

520
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,480
the uh to deliver the b to deliver the

521
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,320
sr policy with different template id

522
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,200
so

523
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,000
template is to be defined as a group of

524
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,679
features for as a policy candidate pass

525
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,720
and it can use an identifier which is

526
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
meaningful to the head and the node of

527
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,280
sr policy

528
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,320
and also template can be configured with

529
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,799
template id and the template contents

530
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,640
like this

531
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,760
so then the bgp protocols can carries

532
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,120
the template id in sr policy candidate

533
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,840
pass attributes

534
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,039
after the hand node of as a policy

535
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,480
receives the

536
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,240
the bgp protocol candidate pass

537
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,039
it can find the contents of the template

538
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,080
using template id and then set up paths

539
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,000
with the features defined in the

540
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,760
template

541
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,039
next slide please

542
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,640
so

543
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,120
in order to uh fulfill fulfill the

544
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,760
template we need the two uh site we need

545
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,880
some extension for bgp for bgp as a

546
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,480
policy protocol uh first we need the two

547
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,279
updaters as a policy

548
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,559
encoding

549
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,159
encoding

550
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,720
with updated template idtl variator like

551
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,679
this

552
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:58,799
and

553
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,880
the format of the template id sub twa is

554
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,799
like this and

555
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,600
here the type the type of the template

556
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,880
id is to be defender and the length is a

557
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,360
fixed value of six

558
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,360
we also use a flag flags trv button now

559
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,000
are defined at this stage

560
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,559
then it it's the value of the template

561
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,480
and it is a four percent value

562
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,600
next slide please

563
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,200
that's all welcome questions and

564
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,480
comments thank you

565
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,480
thank you for presentation we do have

566
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,320
people asking questions

567
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,120
srihari you have the mic

568
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,440
hello

569
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,799
we can hear you

570
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,039
okay question so are you proposing this

571
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,279
template id to be a

572
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,080
globally uh coordinated number how do

573
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,200
you how do you coordinate across

574
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,840
multiple routers

575
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,440
uh

576
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,080
okay the the template id

577
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,919
can be can be

578
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,559
just defined in the device

579
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,520
and

580
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,480
the

581
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,440
the controller can know the template id

582
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,760
uh using

583
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,960
netconf or yarn

584
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,840
also also we can configure

585
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,200
a range of a range to be used as the

586
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,880
timeline default controller the

587
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,320
controller can

588
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,200
allocate to the template id

589
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,840
so what if you see a template id that

590
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,399
conflicts

591
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,400
your document doesn't have to work in

592
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,799
those scenarios

593
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:43,840
okay

594
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,640
if

595
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,400
uh

596
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,840
if there is i think for the the template

597
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,600
id is only to be used in the device and

598
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,799
if

599
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,080
we

600
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,880
we can configure a template

601
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,600
with a template id if the controller

602
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,480
downloads the same template id maybe the

603
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,919
attributes

604
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,600
can be overread

605
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,880
by the

606
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,360
controller the terminator contents can

607
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,480
be overread and updated

608
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,400
okay i'm not sure whether this is going

609
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,240
to be adding value but i'll let others

610
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
take over

611
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,440
thanks jeff

612
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,919
okay essentially we can we can talk

613
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,600
later

614
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,960
offline so next person for the

615
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,640
microphone we have about two minutes

616
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,880
left is andrew

617
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,799
yeah um i just wanted to ask um

618
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,440
in in thinking about this

619
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,440
how you see this working in the case of

620
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,640
where policy is being sent via

621
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,600
reflectors etc because there are cases

622
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,919
where policy is being reflected provided

623
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,279
that you've got

624
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,919
correct communities etc to ensure that

625
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,520
it's accepted

626
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,480
um

627
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,720
when you introduce this templating does

628
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
that not kind of require that the

629
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,480
templates are

630
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,120
globally synchronized within the within

631
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,720
[Music]

632
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,480
you mean

633
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,799
the template how to get the template id

634
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,640
well i mean if if i'm reflecting policy

635
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,960
and it's got a template id then surely

636
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,360
the routers that are accepting

637
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,880
this all have to have the same id

638
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,240
otherwise things are going to get very

639
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,320
messy which means that your template id

640
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,559
kind of has to be unique

641
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,440
um and properly configured across the

642
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,120
entire domain

643
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,640
otherwise the reflection is going to

644
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,880
break surely unless i'm misunderstanding

645
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,760
something

646
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,000
oh oh oh okay i think the the template

647
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,240
id and its content

648
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,640
may just

649
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,080
may just to be identified in the hard

650
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,799
end of the asa policy and no need no

651
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,880
need to be unique

652
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,000
in the whole network

653
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,159
it is only

654
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,480
only used in the

655
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,559
in the head and of the sr policy

656
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,840
okay

657
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,159
we're down to 30 seconds

658
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,559
email

659
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,399
okay i'm up

660
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,279
then

661
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,039
um

662
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,720
i was just gonna say something from

663
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,240
cisco i was just gonna say you know with

664
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,000
the policy we already have one level of

665
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,760
abstraction

666
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,840
and we've been using uh templates and

667
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,399
management uh

668
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,039
platforms for decades

669
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,919
to do variations of a similar similarity

670
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:50,799
you know

671
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,200
objects that are similar to the template

672
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,320
i see no advantage at all of pushing

673
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,200
this

674
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,279
into the protocol

675
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,320
and and in fact i think uh

676
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,000
in this case the

677
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,760
the feature is work

678
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,799
is much worse than any possible benefit

679
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,399
in terms of the problems that people

680
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,919
have been bringing up and those are just

681
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,360
symptoms of this whole thing this is

682
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,240
just a bad idea

683
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,360
okay ac i'm going to ask that uh your

684
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,440
comment uh shraddha we have time for a

685
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,320
very brief comment

686
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,159
uh yeah my comment was very similar to

687
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,720
what ac was talking about so

688
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,440
uh what you could do is uh you can on

689
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,440
the router you configure the template

690
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,240
and

691
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,640
um you can say you can configure another

692
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,480
policy to say

693
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
all sr policies with

694
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,200
having read in their name

695
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,360
would use a red template and something

696
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,520
of that sort and that solves the problem

697
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,640
i i i agree with ac that we i don't

698
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,880
really see the benefit of advertising it

699
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,320
in the protocol

700
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,720
thank you

701
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,360
thank you charlotte okay thank you

702
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,240
thank you

703
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,720
uh please check the chat there's a lot

704
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,799
of comments there and it sounds like we

705
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,799
have good topics for email list

706
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,720
discussion

707
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,120
our next presentation thank you

708
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,960
you're welcome

709
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,120
our next presentation is going to be hp

710
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,600
extensions

711
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,799
we can hear you

712
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,080
okay

713
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,720
and this draft is about pgp extension

714
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,880
for as i'm pure as entropy label

715
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,919
position

716
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,480
next slide please

717
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:42,080
ifc8662 proposes to use entropy labels

718
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,520
for sr and pos networks as described in

719
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,320
it determine the best place for eli and

720
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,039
eo label pulse may not be an easy

721
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,080
decision

722
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,799
multiple criterias may be considered

723
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,919
such as the eild of the nodes along the

724
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,200
path and the msd of the header node and

725
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,240
the bindings in the node and limitations

726
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,080
like segment type

727
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,440
maximum

728
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,159
maximalizing number of lsrs that we

729
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,519
already balanced may also be considered

730
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,159
next slide

731
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,760
this figure shows an inter-demand

732
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,679
scenario the end

733
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,159
end to end pass from node a to node e is

734
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,360
calculated by a centralized controller

735
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,559
along this path load balance is required

736
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,880
the header node in domain 1 may not be

737
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,519
able to get the information of the nodes

738
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,880
or c's in command 2 for example the eiod

739
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,760
of each node in this case it's difficult

740
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,080
for the header node in domain 1 to

741
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,320
decide the best place of the entropy

742
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,360
labels

743
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,279
another choice is to

744
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,519
perform the computation of the entropy

745
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,919
label position along this path by the

746
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,120
controller

747
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,159
and after computation the sr path with

748
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,640
the entropy label position information

749
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,200
can be learned by the header node via

750
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,600
different mechanisms such as pcp or btp

751
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,000
and this document proposes extensions

752
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,880
for bgp to indicate entropy label

753
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,039
position in the segment list

754
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,279
when distributing as a policy can either

755
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,519
pass using pgp

756
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,080
next slide

757
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,480
and if lag is introduced in the flag

758
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,760
field of segment-less sub-tree to

759
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,640
indicate the presence of the eoi ear

760
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,880
label pairs which are inserted after

761
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,159
this segment

762
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,279
it is applicable to srn pos segment

763
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,240
types

764
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,559
and whether to insert the entropy label

765
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,320
pairs is decided by the ingress note

766
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,879
next slide

767
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,279
and here are the summary of main updates

768
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,399
of the draft

769
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,519
it has been presented in itf or

770
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,960
110 and comments from the main list are

771
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,159
appreciated from jeff and robin

772
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,840
and we add more descript

773
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,760
and the cloud classification and

774
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,960
clarifications in the new version based

775
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,559
on the comments

776
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,399
the centralized controller would be

777
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,600
useful to compute both sr paths and the

778
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,720
placement of entropy labels especially

779
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,799
in the entertainment scenario

780
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,480
and this draft follows the

781
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,960
considerations for entropy label

782
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,840
position in ifc 8662

783
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,000
the values of entropy labels are still

784
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,279
calculated by ingress node as specified

785
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:39,420
in

786
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,640
[Music]

787
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,799
ifc

788
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:45,840
6980 and ifc862

789
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,559
other mechanisms are out of scope and

790
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,480
more text is added about how the

791
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,120
controller get the information needed to

792
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,880
calculate the entropy

793
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,279
entropy label position validating the

794
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,799
existing work

795
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,360
next slide

796
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,039
and we request feedback on feedbacks and

797
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,200
comments and would like to ask for

798
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,440
considering adopting all these drives

799
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,839
that's all

800
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,639
we have time for a brief question if

801
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,800
there any

802
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,520
okay i do not see any hands raised in

803
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,679
the mic queue i do suggest you take a

804
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,199
look at the comment from shihar in the

805
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,040
chat asking about how we actually

806
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,960
determine this

807
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,239
i believe you are also the next

808
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,879
presenter

809
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,760
yes

810
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,199
and okay and

811
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,480
this draft is about bgp extensions of sr

812
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,839
policy for pass protection next slide

813
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,720
it is introduced in the sr policy

814
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,520
architecture that kennedy pass

815
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,000
may be used for pass protection

816
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,880
and the backup kennedy pass provides

817
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,520
protection only when all the segment

818
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,680
lists in the active candidate pass are

819
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
invalid

820
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,680
and scenarios like load balancing may

821
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,560
need the segment lists for protection

822
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,280
for example candidate pass

823
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,480
one is active can it pass the flows are

824
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,720
load balanced between the segment list

825
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,160
one and two

826
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,520
and cb2 will only take place

827
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,040
uh when both at least one and list two

828
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,480
are invalid

829
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,119
and in some scenario we may want to

830
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,800
protect this one so after list 1 fails

831
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,119
flows can still be load balanced between

832
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,720
list 2 and the backup list of list 1.

833
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,440
and the relation and the protection

834
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,520
relationship between segment lists

835
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,359
should be flexible

836
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,119
and there's already a working group

837
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,320
document in pc that proposes extensions

838
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,599
to pcp to provide backup segment lists

839
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,920
for protection based on the above

840
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,320
considerations this document many

841
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,960
proposes extensions of bgp

842
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,359
in order to provide pass protection

843
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,760
using segment lists when delivering sr

844
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,800
policy

845
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,839
next slide

846
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,560
and this slide shows the bgb extensions

847
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,680
for sr policy if the b flag in the

848
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,880
segment list sub tov is set it indicates

849
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,560
that the segment list

850
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,040
act as in backup path

851
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,760
and this identifier subtree is used to

852
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,760
identify the segment list

853
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,720
and it contains an optional subject this

854
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,200
protection theory it carries the

855
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,400
protection relationship of segment lists

856
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,960
next slide

857
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,480
and this draft also proposes extensions

858
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,320
of bgp os the tlsp distribution draft

859
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,960
describes a mechanism to collect the

860
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,800
hazard policy information that is

861
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,440
locally available in the node and

862
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,640
advertise it into bgb os updates

863
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,200
it includes kennedy parts site tlv and

864
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,800
segment list tov the s flag and b flag

865
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,200
are originally defined in kennedy past

866
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,240
state tlv and two new flags of similar

867
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,079
meanings in segment list here we are

868
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,920
defined in this draft

869
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,400
the s flag indicates the segment list is

870
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,680
in administrative short state and the b

871
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,680
flag indicates a segment list is a

872
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,760
backup password set

873
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,320
next slide

874
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,839
and this draft has been presented in idr

875
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,599
in itf 109 and received suggestions from

876
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,200
carton and joe

877
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,920
that since this draft is related with

878
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,960
high policy it's better to progress work

879
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,119
first in spring before bringing up

880
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,000
protocol mechanism for adoption

881
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,359
and this draft has been presented in

882
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:10,720
spring in ita 411 next slide

883
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,160
considering that we got to know

884
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,400
objection about the idea from the spring

885
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,280
and

886
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,800
similar mechanism in pc has been adopted

887
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,599
we would like to ask for considering for

888
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,599
working group of doctor that's all

889
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,440
okay we do have caitanya in the queue

890
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,320
kate any other mic

891
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,160
uh

892
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,560
thanks for this uh presentation update

893
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,040
uh i just wanted to clarify on my

894
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,079
comment

895
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,960
and the previous idr presentation

896
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,839
uh

897
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,680
the proposal here is to change the

898
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,839
semantics of segment list

899
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,440
from a load balancing ecmp construct

900
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,800
to a active and backup construct

901
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,520
i believe that something that should be

902
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,720
kind of reviewed and updated uh in the

903
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,320
spring working group

904
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,480
before this protocol extension is done

905
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,839
so

906
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,599
what's this what you're proposing here

907
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,599
is a change to the sr policy

908
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,599
architecture and you know it's it's fine

909
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,160
to do so but i would suggest to do that

910
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,040
first in spring

911
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,400
uh to

912
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,440
i was suggesting that we should

913
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,200
first update the hazard policy

914
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,839
architecture

915
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,560
yes because

916
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,880
semantics

917
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,119
of load balancing right so segment lists

918
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,960
are for load balancing

919
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,359
and they do not have the active backup

920
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,839
construct

921
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,240
okay uh

922
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,480
i think that since there are

923
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,400
already many

924
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,000
draft update

925
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,720
adding some attributes and

926
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,079
some changes as our policy architecture

927
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,359
uh yeah how we will collect more we can

928
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,760
we can discuss on this yeah we can

929
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,839
discuss on spring mailer perhaps yeah

930
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:06,960
thank you

931
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,839
okay sure thank you

932
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,720
and uh thank you

933
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,040
we'll make sure to capture that point in

934
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,800
the minutes and uh you know coordinate

935
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,200
with spring you know and use uh

936
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,480
when this work should move forward in

937
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,960
bgb

938
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,880
our next presentation is point to

939
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,960
multi-point policy woman you have to

940
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,560
mike

941
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,880
thank you very much uh if we can go to

942
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,839
the next slide please

943
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,960
uh can can you folks hear me

944
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,680
hello we can hear you fine

945
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,720
oh okay sorry uh i have some audio

946
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,359
problems so uh if anywhere i drop my

947
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,520
colleague andrew will take over and

948
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,200
finish the presentation

949
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,960
uh with that said i just wanted to give

950
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,720
a little bit of update with regard to

951
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,319
all the draft that

952
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,800
we are out there for point-to-multipoint

953
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,000
policy

954
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,400
um as you can see there is two mother

955
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,359
and father drafts there is a replication

956
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,319
segment

957
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,640
and then there is a point to multi-point

958
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,598
policy under

959
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,800
so we do seem to be experiencing those

960
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,440
audio problems

961
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,680
and the next hops on the data path the

962
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,079
point to multi-point policy uh to make

963
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,920
it very short and sweet are the

964
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,480
candidate paths there can be

965
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,319
two or more candidate paths and the

966
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:35,760
candidate pad with the highest

967
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,000
preference is the active

968
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,319
and then under those candidate paths we

969
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,400
have what we call path

970
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,240
instances and the path instances are

971
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,440
really used for global

972
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,400
optimization of a candidate pad itself

973
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,440
uh moving forward obviously for services

974
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,440
we need signaling uh via mpbgp which the

975
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,119
mvpn evpn sr point to multi-point policy

976
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,200
draft is all about

977
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,400
and

978
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,240
also there is

979
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,839
a yang model

980
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,400
and then there is this

981
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,079
idr

982
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,800
draft which uses the

983
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,079
bgp

984
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,319
point to multi-point srte policy if you

985
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,160
will to download

986
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,359
the

987
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,319
instructions from controller to each one

988
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,200
of the routers or nodes to set up the

989
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,839
data path from the root all the way to

990
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,000
the leaf which we'll talk about there is

991
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,280
a pce draft which accomplishes the same

992
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,240
thing through the pce uh

993
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,640
there is an adoption call going on

994
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,440
and i think the deadline for that is

995
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,280
november 25th

996
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,240
and last but not least there is the ping

997
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,440
draft

998
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,160
uh which is really because the point to

999
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,400
multiple point policy is

1000
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,200
all about the controller and the pce

1001
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,079
uh

1002
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,720
the ping draft actually provides some

1003
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,119
oem functionality on the data pad to

1004
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,520
make sure that the tree is functional

1005
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,400
from the root to the leaf so it is very

1006
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,880
important uh one point i want to put on

1007
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,200
the table here with regard to the ping

1008
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,800
as of now that ping draft is for mpls

1009
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,760
only and for srv6 we need to have

1010
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,400
another draft depending on how the

1011
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,160
conversation for srv6 oem pans out in

1012
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,839
the spring uh

1013
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:30,880
later

1014
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,760
next slide please

1015
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,359
uh so going quickly over i already

1016
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,040
talked about some of these concepts of

1017
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,440
the point to multiplying policy so again

1018
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,760
it's very similar to unicast we are

1019
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,839
using canada paths you can have many

1020
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,400
candidate paths with the active canada

1021
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,040
pad being the

1022
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,160
being the one with the highest

1023
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,319
preference you can engineer your

1024
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,119
candidate paths based on the controller

1025
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,839
and download them as a sr lg separate

1026
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,280
from each other you can do all these

1027
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,359
tricks with each one of the candidate

1028
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,319
paths a candidate pat in a multicast

1029
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:10,000
domain is really identified via a root

1030
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,920
and a tree id

1031
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,359
and there are multiple multiple ways to

1032
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:16,720
build these

1033
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,760
trees

1034
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,480
and the canada paths if you will uh you

1035
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,920
know there could be pcc initiated uh

1036
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,440
where you use the mvpn procedures

1037
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,079
to discover the leaves throughout your

1038
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,920
network and uh somehow the controller

1039
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,480
needs to

1040
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,400
start listening to this

1041
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,000
bgp

1042
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,920
ad routes going back and forth from the

1043
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,480
leaf and the root and discover these

1044
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,440
leaves and based on that we can use this

1045
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,480
srte point to multiply as rte draft to

1046
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,079
download the instructions to the router

1047
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,599
with the same token you can go on the

1048
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,119
controller itself and program the tree

1049
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,839
manually from the root to the leaves and

1050
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:02,880
then

1051
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,720
the instruction will be downloaded via

1052
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,079
this draft

1053
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,960
next slide please

1054
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,800
so here's a visualization of what i just

1055
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,240
talked about sometimes you know a

1056
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,400
picture speaks a thousand words

1057
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,520
so again at the root you have the canada

1058
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,440
paths as i said you can have multiple

1059
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,839
candidate paths uh the one thing i want

1060
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,720
to stress here is the instance

1061
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,920
ids or the instance paths uh basically

1062
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,440
the instance paths are the lsps the

1063
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,240
point to multi-point lsps itself as i

1064
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,119
mentioned each canada path can have

1065
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,119
two at least two uh instance path

1066
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,280
and the reason for that is

1067
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,720
because we want to have a global

1068
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,400
optimization so

1069
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,480
if for whatever reason the controller

1070
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,560
decides that it wants to optimize a

1071
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,960
canada path it downloads a second point

1072
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,880
to multi-point lsp uh via the instance

1073
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,359
pad number two and then we do mbb

1074
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,599
procedures from one instance pad to

1075
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,839
another instance pad on the candidate

1076
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,520
path itself and then you have the

1077
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,599
replication seats which are the

1078
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,240
replication points and obviously these

1079
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,520
replication seats can be steered

1080
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,839
via unicast

1081
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,280
sr policy

1082
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,200
and they can be connected via unicast

1083
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,800
segment routing

1084
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,319
throughout the network so it's a very

1085
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,560
powerful concept

1086
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,040
you only do the replication at the

1087
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,760
points that you desire

1088
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,160
uh anywhere else we can use all the

1089
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,720
goodies of unicast as our policy that

1090
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,160
our art out there currently including uh

1091
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,280
fast reroute ecmp et cetera et cetera

1092
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,160
next slide please

1093
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,359
so uh we made some changes uh with

1094
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,040
regard to the

1095
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,319
bgp nlri and route type

1096
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,040
as of now there is a single nlri as you

1097
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,480
can see in this picture and there are

1098
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,280
three different route types so one rod

1099
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,200
type is for the point-to-multipoint

1100
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,599
policy itself to download the canada

1101
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:06,560
paths

1102
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,119
and then we wanted to make sure that

1103
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,400
this draft

1104
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,599
is mimicking the unicast

1105
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,720
policy as a policy very closely and as

1106
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,599
such

1107
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:18,560
we

1108
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,160
change the route types for the

1109
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,400
replication segment which is the the

1110
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,520
instructions to program the data path on

1111
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,240
each node so we came up with a route

1112
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,240
type which is a binding seat

1113
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,079
the binding stick is really the ingress

1114
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,920
label coming into the node which

1115
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,400
identifies the replication segment

1116
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,800
and on the egress

1117
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,920
we came up with the outgoing interface

1118
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,280
route type so that's oif route and

1119
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,240
basically what it is is it downloads

1120
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,200
each

1121
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,920
single outgoing interface as an

1122
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,040
individual object if you will and

1123
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,720
doing so it makes it very much in par

1124
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,520
with the unicast sr

1125
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,960
policy

1126
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,160
draft that is already in the idr so

1127
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,720
by downloading each oif it's as if like

1128
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,200
you're downloading a unicast

1129
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,240
uh for one of the branch of the trees

1130
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,640
and it really becomes in very nicely

1131
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,040
with what we already have on the unicast

1132
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,240
side

1133
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,440
for the sr policy in in the idea

1134
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,319
next slide please

1135
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,960
so i'm not gonna go too much into this

1136
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,760
this is the point to multiply policy for

1137
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,160
the candidate path itself as you can see

1138
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,079
we download each candidate path uh

1139
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,400
individually and then you have the path

1140
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,400
instances which i already explained that

1141
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,760
are used for

1142
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,359
make for

1143
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,559
for optimization of each canada path uh

1144
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,880
there is an optional leaf list that's

1145
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,839
just for debuggability if it's a

1146
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,160
control initiated three then you can

1147
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,720
download this leaflets to the router as

1148
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,040
well just so that the if you have a show

1149
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,040
command or if you have a

1150
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,280
event uh the router can actually say

1151
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,640
that here are my uh remote uh leaf list

1152
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,559
uh that's the only reason that we

1153
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,480
download those leaflets as such their

1154
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,160
option nexus slide please

1155
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,839
so here's the the point to multipoint

1156
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,079
and i think i made a mistake here this

1157
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,319
is not the policy this is the oif the

1158
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,480
outgoing uh interface again the point

1159
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,720
here was we wanted to make this very

1160
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,000
uniform with the unicast as our policy

1161
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,559
and as such we are downloading it the

1162
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:41,839
uh

1163
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,880
one outgoing interface at a time rather

1164
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,160
than downloading the entire replication

1165
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,720
segment with all the oifs

1166
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,599
downloading a single oaf at the time

1167
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:54,480
will

1168
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,400
allow us to

1169
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,640
download a segment list just for that

1170
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,920
oif and we use the same concepts of

1171
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,359
unicast which is the ecmp per weight and

1172
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,280
we also added the protection in there

1173
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,839
which was your previous presenter kind

1174
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:13,200
of presented the concept of unicast uh

1175
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,760
sorry for uh the concept of protection

1176
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,400
for unicast we do have such a concept

1177
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,040
for multicast as well next slide please

1178
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,960
so uh obviously as always comments are

1179
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,800
welcome uh we would like to beef up the

1180
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,440
draft and we have already done the ipr

1181
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,240
call that was done on the last uh

1182
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,040
ietf and uh we are asking for adoption

1183
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,400
again in this itf uh to go for

1184
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,720
thank you

1185
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,319
okay we do have time for some questions

1186
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:50,079
we are actually doing very excellent on

1187
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,760
our scheduling

1188
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,319
we have jeffrey jung in the microphone

1189
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,559
queue jeffrey

1190
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,599
um hi i just want to comment that

1191
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:00,800
there are

1192
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,960
another way to set up the srp20p

1193
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,520
even using bgp

1194
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,800
and so and that is not listed in that

1195
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,119
list of the traps in one of the earlier

1196
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,359
slides i just want to point out that

1197
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,160
there is another option and that is

1198
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,079
actually what uh

1199
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,839
jeff was talking about earlier that

1200
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:22,880
there are

1201
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,400
uh there are uh discussions ongoing on

1202
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,319
where the work should take place and

1203
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,599
things like that

1204
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:30,480
um

1205
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,400
so just want to point out but that

1206
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,559
there's another option to do it to do

1207
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:35,599
the same

1208
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,839
thank you

1209
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,240
okay why mo you have the microphone

1210
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,760
yeah can you hear me

1211
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,200
we can

1212
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,839
good

1213
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,599
and we are no longer hearing you coibo

1214
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,960
yeah can you upload the slides

1215
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,200
ah you're in for next presentation sorry

1216
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,559
just want to make sure if you're having

1217
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:09,839
questions of the current presentation or

1218
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,078
not

1219
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,200
okay one moment

1220
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,599
hello everyone today i'm going to talk

1221
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,960
about the bgp for bt pass

1222
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,599
next page

1223
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,000
so this draft is about a bgp

1224
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,680
to distribute

1225
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,839
a ba t pass

1226
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:53,359
to the increase of the pass

1227
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,559
so we know bgp

1228
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,520
has already been extended

1229
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,480
to

1230
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,760
distribute different type of

1231
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,440
point to multiple intermolecular

1232
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,280
policies

1233
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:07,860
using

1234
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,119
[Music]

1235
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,400
pmsi partner attributes

1236
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,760
for example

1237
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,839
rfc

1238
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,079
6514

1239
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,160
defined

1240
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,160
a new tunnel type a new tunnel type

1241
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,720
which is called

1242
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,359
rsppte

1243
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,240
p2mp tunnel pass

1244
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,400
to distribute

1245
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,119
t p to p multiples

1246
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:35,360
to

1247
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,640
[Music]

1248
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,240
a in the in

1249
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,079
in the pgp

1250
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,720
so another example is that

1251
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,880
rfc

1252
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,599
58556

1253
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,559
define a new tunnel type

1254
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,720
for beer

1255
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,599
so use this tunnel type

1256
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,040
distribute

1257
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,079
beard

1258
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:59,200
pass

1259
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,440
in the bgp

1260
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,319
so it's very straightforward and easy

1261
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,559
to extend the bgp

1262
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:10,480
to distribute a bte pass

1263
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,800
so so we

1264
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,599
define a new tunnel type

1265
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,920
for brte

1266
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,359
under

1267
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:23,599
pmsi turner attribute to

1268
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:26,319
a bat path to the ingredients of the

1269
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,558
past

1270
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,440
so in addition

1271
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,000
we also

1272
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,240
describe another option

1273
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,440
which is

1274
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,920
define a new tunnel type

1275
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,680
on the tunnel

1276
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,559
encapsulation attribute

1277
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:47,760
to distribute a penalty a distributed

1278
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,359
batte path to the inverse of the pass

1279
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:54,160
so next page

1280
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,440
so

1281
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,720
under

1282
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,440
psmi tunnel attribute

1283
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,400
which is

1284
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,760
attribute type 22

1285
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,920
so we define

1286
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,160
a new tunnel type

1287
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,200
for

1288
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,559
bht blte

1289
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,839
so for vit

1290
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:21,599
pass it will contain

1291
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,440
a pass id

1292
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,920
and the number of subtlety of these

1293
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,000
the pass id

1294
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:28,880
or

1295
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,720
password identifier

1296
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,799
consists of

1297
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:35,839
sub domain id

1298
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,599
bfr id

1299
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,760
of the english node

1300
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,599
and the panel ids

1301
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,280
and the past numbers

1302
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,359
so these four combined

1303
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,799
will identify or uniquely identify

1304
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,559
a bft

1305
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,240
path

1306
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,240
so the subq

1307
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,280
will con

1308
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,079
will include

1309
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,319
a pass

1310
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,720
a a t pass

1311
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,400
subtle v's

1312
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,319
so this subtle v

1313
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,799
will encode

1314
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,480
the

1315
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,599
explicit vat path

1316
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:14,960
in addition

1317
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,920
the subtlety of e may contain

1318
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,920
a b t pass name subtrees

1319
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,880
which

1320
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,520
indicates the name of the blte path

1321
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,000
the next page

1322
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:38,880
so this is similar so we extend bgp

1323
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,160
under

1324
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,200
terminal

1325
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,200
income attribute

1326
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,720
so on this

1327
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,319
attribute we define new type for bat

1328
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:49,280
task

1329
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,480
so this

1330
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,319
under this

1331
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:53,200
type

1332
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,440
will include sub as a number of

1333
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,880
subtitles

1334
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,559
so subtree will include

1335
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,240
bat pass

1336
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,640
subconvey which includes the pass

1337
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,599
and then the name trv which is indicated

1338
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:08,960
the name of the path

1339
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,920
and then the path id subtrees which i

1340
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,240
then uniquely identify

1341
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,000
plt pass

1342
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,799
so next page

1343
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,720
so we describe two options

1344
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,520
to for bgp

1345
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,240
to distribute the bht plus to ingress of

1346
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,280
the past

1347
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,640
so both

1348
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,520
options are straightforward so uh we

1349
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,799
would like to

1350
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:40,000
ask comments and also we would like to

1351
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,160
request

1352
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,520
or drop shares thank you

1353
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,680
okay we have jeffrey john at the

1354
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,760
microphone

1355
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,319
um so why won't you talk about the two

1356
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:56,400
options here um

1357
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,040
it's not clear to me whether you are

1358
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,599
going to use one of the options or are

1359
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,520
the two options going to be used for

1360
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,280
different purposes

1361
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,760
and another comment is that

1362
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,359
here you're just talking about the

1363
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:10,960
encodings

1364
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,680
but exactly how they're going to be used

1365
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,079
i assume they will be talked about in

1366
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,240
another working group or

1367
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,720
is it in best or in or in beer

1368
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,160
you're referring to the first question

1369
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,480
uh so two options i think we just

1370
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,599
because

1371
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,240
this is uh uh

1372
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,480
we just proposed two options i think

1373
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,839
both options uh will be work will be

1374
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,280
equivalent from my point of view looks

1375
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,559
like the first option uh is a

1376
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:44,079
is preferred i think that

1377
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:45,760
in the finally

1378
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,880
well one option will be will be selected

1379
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,119
so that's wha we're gonna first of all

1380
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:52,799
uh question so

1381
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,119
the second question is about the

1382
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,359
application of this one i think in the

1383
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,520
in the draft or in the first

1384
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,559
presentation in the nasa master idea i

1385
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:04,640
think we describe

1386
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,480
how to apply these uh

1387
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,319
extensions basically my understanding is

1388
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:14,400
to your question is that how do we

1389
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,839
distribute the

1390
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,000
the equal part at the past to the

1391
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,319
english is that your question so you if

1392
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:22,319
that's your question and then we

1393
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:25,599
describe the more details

1394
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,160
um so

1395
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,040
my comments here is that

1396
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,720
first we should

1397
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,440
pick why which way to go and then then

1398
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,799
we can uh

1399
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:39,119
adopt it and

1400
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:43,119
i i haven't uh read that draft yet uh

1401
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,640
so i assume that uh either this draft or

1402
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,480
another draft that does talk about the

1403
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,760
use case

1404
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,200
and typically a

1405
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,839
that that it will be

1406
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:58,880
adopted in a working group

1407
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,000
that where the use cases for for example

1408
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,040
the uh pnz tunnel attributes was

1409
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,119
initially uh

1410
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,000
designed for mvpn and that was in the in

1411
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:10,720
the

1412
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,240
best working group

1413
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,400
and here you are if you are to go in

1414
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,440
with the

1415
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,880
uh uh pimzi uh tunnel uh uh

1416
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,359
attributes uh uh option

1417
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:23,839
i assume this is going to be used in in

1418
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:26,559
some uh application applications like

1419
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,559
map or evpn

1420
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,240
and seems that

1421
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,240
the best working group would be a better

1422
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,598
place to adopt

1423
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,359
yes regarding the application and then

1424
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:44,480
we can so this is the multicast tunnels

1425
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,520
so

1426
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,400
you can use it in the for mvpn and also

1427
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,640
it can be used to just uh

1428
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,640
carry the market traffic right

1429
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,799
so are you is this not limited to one

1430
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,040
applications uh or one application

1431
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,920
scenarios or cases

1432
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,160
is this useful

1433
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,240
this this is sue

1434
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,760
just a minute jeffrey um

1435
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:16,240
some of your logic is is not necessarily

1436
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,680
uh

1437
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,000
um

1438
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,079
necessary for where you're going to

1439
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,160
place the document some of the things

1440
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,200
have to do with what specifications they

1441
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,559
modify

1442
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:32,799
so don't worry about the working group

1443
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,040
this is going to be

1444
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,240
reviewed in in cases where you're

1445
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,720
changing the tunnel

1446
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,760
uh

1447
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:45,040
encapsulation draft

1448
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:45,920
and

1449
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,520
uh changing multicast functionality

1450
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,359
odds are this would be one of those

1451
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,680
drafts which would need to be reviewed

1452
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,079
by both best and idea

1453
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,160
where it starts out

1454
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,240
it would have to be reviewed and

1455
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,039
probably approved by both so

1456
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:07,599
let's not focus on where the draft

1457
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:10,319
ends up and let the chairs deal with

1458
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:14,319
that as we're trying to deal with with

1459
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:16,160
the other portions of the multicast

1460
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,960
let's take today's discussion

1461
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,039
and focus on the questions on the

1462
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:25,200
technology would that be okay jeffrey

1463
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:29,520
definitely yeah it is okay um but like

1464
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,480
to go back to my earlier question

1465
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,920
is this for this setting up a tunnel

1466
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:36,720
or

1467
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,720
to announce how the tunnel is going to

1468
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,640
be used

1469
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,680
yeah this is about a distributed tunnel

1470
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,119
to the ingress

1471
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,280
so just like those uh

1472
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,520
for example distributed panel

1473
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,920
as i mentioned that there are already

1474
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,240
extensions there

1475
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,920
to do the similar work to distribute the

1476
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,039
panel

1477
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,920
in pgp right this is a straightforward

1478
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,920
extension

1479
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:07,599
the the reason i'm asking is that

1480
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,440
when we are using the

1481
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,880
uh pmc timer attribute that is

1482
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,119
that is to announce

1483
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:17,280
what kind of tunnel to use

1484
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,400
so depending on the on the use case of

1485
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,599
of your

1486
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,200
of your draft

1487
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,760
you will you will have have bearing on

1488
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,760
which option to go

1489
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,200
so

1490
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:33,200
yeah i think this one uh for blt tunnel

1491
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,200
looks like a straightforward so we just

1492
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,559
because uh

1493
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:38,720
i just had gum in my mouth

1494
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,400
and then we just did the tunnel to the

1495
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,359
ingress

1496
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,920
so just like for example similar for the

1497
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,359
sr policy

1498
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:47,599
so just they have sr tunnel and then

1499
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:49,440
send it to the english node of the

1500
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,119
timeout and that's all

1501
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,960
this is very simple straightforward

1502
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,599
yeah i guess we can take it offline but

1503
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,280
obviously the first

1504
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,359
first thing is that to determine which

1505
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:04,240
option to go with

1506
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
yeah that we can discuss in the main

1507
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,079
list and then just select one options

1508
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,559
because this is just a start point and

1509
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:15,039
also on the

1510
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:16,880
there's a starting point and then with a

1511
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,720
couple of options it's okay and then

1512
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,359
finally we finalize the to one option

1513
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,359
right

1514
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:34,559
okay uh we also have driven them like

1515
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,839
thank you

1516
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,160
yeah thanks jeff uh jeff my comment was

1517
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,400
not related to the slide per se but

1518
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,240
since we have little bit time on the

1519
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,960
agenda i wanted to discuss maybe

1520
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,960
to the chairs and the ad

1521
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,880
looking at the agenda today like you

1522
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:49,680
know

1523
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,000
all the six presentations that were

1524
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,960
presented so far have a similar

1525
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,880
work happening in pc working group as

1526
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,200
well and as a pc working group chair i

1527
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,880
haven't discussed this with my co-chair

1528
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,960
yet but i just this thought came to my

1529
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,440
mind i wanted to discuss what could we

1530
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,720
do better so that the coordination

1531
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,880
between these drafts happened a little

1532
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,880
bit better because i've seen like there

1533
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,640
have been cases where things have been

1534
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,720
missed a flags have been missed and now

1535
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,960
we are writing extensions in pc working

1536
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,000
group to add those flags back and stuff

1537
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,160
like that so what can we do so that the

1538
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,480
work which is common

1539
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,160
don't miss things out there is still

1540
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,400
coordination between them should we do a

1541
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,440
wiki

1542
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,440
should we ask authors to

1543
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,200
commit that yes they have reviewed the

1544
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,520
document other draft and made sure that

1545
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,000
things are aligned so i wanted to check

1546
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,160
like what thoughts like maybe you have

1547
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,000
or we can discuss this later but

1548
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,920
something that i wanted to discuss

1549
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,520
further thank you

1550
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,799
okay and before sue speaks uh based on

1551
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:53,520
what we have left in the scheduled queue

1552
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,359
uh if it's okay with sue and k or i'd

1553
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:57,119
like to reserve at least 15 minutes for

1554
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,640
you know this discussion

1555
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,480
i know it's near and dear to alvaro's

1556
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,599
heart as well

1557
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:05,240
so please go ahead

1558
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:09,200
drew if we should get together as chairs

1559
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,160
but also put a wiki on the

1560
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,119
apart on the idea wiki for you to tell

1561
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:18,400
me which drafts need to be reviewed

1562
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,640
so if you look at the idea or

1563
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,480
uh wiki you'll find a place for it

1564
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:29,280
right and adding to sue's comment

1565
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,400
uh

1566
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,160
we've had some general discussion as we

1567
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,359
mentioned at the beginning of the

1568
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:36,000
session that uh the best and idr chair

1569
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,079
is already starting to discuss this

1570
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:39,920
and a significant portion of the work

1571
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,760
you're seeing in the first portion of

1572
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,799
the presentations was organized because

1573
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:46,960
of exactly these sorts of issues

1574
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,599
we want to be able to have good you know

1575
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:51,359
cross-working group coordination for

1576
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:53,520
features we know that technologies are

1577
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,720
reaching

1578
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,400
across boundaries considerably more

1579
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,039
these days and bgp is a

1580
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:00,559
somewhat generic bit of transport

1581
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,160
plumbing for some of these mechanisms

1582
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,359
especially for

1583
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,200
tunneling

1584
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,240
is something that we end up

1585
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,480
rendezvousing at i think you're seeing

1586
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,440
something very similar in pce that pce

1587
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,359
has a programming mechanism for

1588
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:14,480
ingresses

1589
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,640
has to coordinate as well so we're

1590
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,920
looking at

1591
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,960
it's the usual combination of you know a

1592
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,160
place of where we want to place state

1593
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,160
initiated either at the head end

1594
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,359
transported around the network and

1595
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,960
routing protocols

1596
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,599
and result in forwarding behaviors

1597
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:34,000
and alvaro has discussed that

1598
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,680
we do need some level of a coordination

1599
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,160
mechanism but hasn't given us a specific

1600
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:42,279
set of requirements at this point

1601
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,160
good that we are thinking about it and

1602
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,400
let's get together and figure out a plan

1603
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,079
thank you

1604
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:52,319
thank you dad roof uh jeffrey you have

1605
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,640
the cue

1606
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:58,880
question for drew um i'm just curious uh

1607
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,960
the pce working group

1608
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,640
is it's uh

1609
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,119
specifically for the psap protocol or is

1610
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:06,160
it for

1611
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,839
or does it also include the general

1612
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:13,200
pcea ae pcc a architecture that when

1613
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,640
peace peace particle is not used

1614
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,520
no we are only for extending the psa

1615
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,839
protocol our architecture belongs in

1616
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:24,839
teas

1617
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:28,880
the last sentence uh the architecture

1618
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,960
belongs to what

1619
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,359
the pc architecture belongs in teas

1620
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,359
working group and we do the extension

1621
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:36,479
work

1622
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,640
i see the protocol extension

1623
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,560
okay so when it comes to srp20 tunnel

1624
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,600
setup

1625
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,479
there are there is a uh

1626
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,319
psap extension

1627
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:51,520
and then um to to to to set up the

1628
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,839
tunnel using the pc protocol and then

1629
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:58,238
there are two uh uh bgp proposals uh to

1630
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:01,279
set up using using bgp

1631
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,560
so the the presentation that the woman

1632
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,920
did earlier is specifically about using

1633
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,880
uh one way of using bgp to set up the

1634
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,319
the the srp

1635
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:17,359
tunnel but indeed when it comes to srp

1636
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:18,399
to mp

1637
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:20,799
there are uh uh there are different ways

1638
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:25,278
uh uh to set up including the psa

1639
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,439
yeah that's correct

1640
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:28,319
yes

1641
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:29,839
yeah and that's correct we are only

1642
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:32,080
handling the pcp extension part of it

1643
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,759
the actual

1644
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:36,960
sr p2mp policy that all belongs in pim

1645
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,399
and they have a document there which is

1646
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,479
adopted

1647
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:41,520
yes

1648
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,759
yeah thank you

1649
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:45,279
right that's exactly the points we were

1650
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:46,640
talking about earlier at the beginning

1651
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,319
of the session uh alfredo you have the

1652
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:50,799
microphone

1653
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,679
uh good morning or uh good afternoon

1654
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:00,719
whatever you are um

1655
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,080
yeah so this keeps happening more and

1656
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,800
more and and i just posted on the chat

1657
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,040
um that

1658
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,440
uh we keep seeing this

1659
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,320
more

1660
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,800
uh as you guys have already mentioned

1661
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,640
you know that that multicast multi-point

1662
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,239
multipoint

1663
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:20,320
work that's coming up in bass idr spring

1664
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:23,360
there's some pc work as well pim

1665
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,239
beer

1666
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:26,719
etc

1667
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:28,320
we need to

1668
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,040
find better ways of doing this and

1669
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,120
uh martin john and i have been you know

1670
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,640
talking about this

1671
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,120
and uh we don't have a silver bullet to

1672
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,600
be honest on how to solve

1673
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,600
the problem or how to make

1674
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,600
a cross-working group

1675
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,400
work

1676
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,920
better coordinated

1677
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,920
uh it would be really nice if we could

1678
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,600
find a

1679
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,199
consistent way

1680
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:52,480
so that we don't have to reinvent the

1681
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,080
wheel every time something happens or

1682
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,760
every time something comes up

1683
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,800
but so that we have as not just working

1684
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,719
group participants but chairs you know

1685
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:03,520
the ability or the tools to

1686
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,920
to find that better um

1687
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,120
coordination

1688
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,440
so i think uh one of the things for

1689
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,440
example is what you guys mentioned here

1690
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,040
about you know having a wiki with drafts

1691
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,960
etc of course we then need to know how

1692
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,960
to find that wiki and we need all the

1693
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,960
authors to to know that

1694
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,520
um we've been talking about uh and jeff

1695
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,320
mentioned that up in the chat before

1696
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,880
about some type of review team

1697
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:27,760
um

1698
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,080
to try and coordinate things across

1699
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,840
working groups uh some of the things

1700
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,440
that we're seeing is for example based

1701
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:34,880
on the point of multi-point architecture

1702
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,520
and pim there are multiple solutions my

1703
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,120
opinion personal opinion is that

1704
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,280
multiple switches around is really bad

1705
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,239
but we need to coordinate them um and if

1706
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:45,520
we're going to have multiple solutions

1707
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,600
we need to just you know make sure that

1708
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,440
there are there are properly reviewed

1709
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,120
across multiple places

1710
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,040
uh if not

1711
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,960
if if we're going to make the decision

1712
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,320
to not then we also need to make that

1713
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,679
decision somehow

1714
01:11:57,679 --> 01:11:59,360
so um

1715
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:02,159
we need to to figure out um

1716
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:04,159
not just where the drafts are going to

1717
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:06,800
be potentially adopted and last called

1718
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,640
and everything else obviously we're

1719
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,560
doing bgp extension site dr is the

1720
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,239
obvious place to do that

1721
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:15,040
uh but we would need uh of course review

1722
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,719
from other places we need some type of

1723
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:17,840
coordination

1724
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,280
um so

1725
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,280
we've been talking as has been mentioned

1726
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,360
here to a bunch of the chairs

1727
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,520
to try and gather ideas and try to

1728
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,840
figure out what is the the best way

1729
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,320
uh going forward uh this point one point

1730
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,159
thing is you want the one that is i

1731
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:34,000
guess the front right now for us and

1732
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,360
we'll probably try something i don't

1733
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,040
know exactly what yet

1734
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:40,159
um and and maybe that will become the

1735
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:43,040
consistent way uh in the meantime if you

1736
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,280
have ideas

1737
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,960
uh thoughts you know what would work

1738
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,800
better would be easier not just for the

1739
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,719
chairs but for the participants in

1740
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:51,760
general

1741
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,480
to

1742
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,040
to have a way to

1743
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,199
know that something else is going on

1744
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,400
um

1745
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,120
besides waiting for the chance that it

1746
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,640
might come up at the routing area open

1747
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,040
meeting for example um

1748
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,120
and and find out about other things

1749
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,600
please let us know uh talk to me or

1750
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,840
martin or or john

1751
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,760
um

1752
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,440
or all of us at the same time whatever

1753
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,440
you want to do and i will be happy to

1754
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,040
listen to that we're still looking for

1755
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,280
for what is the best way

1756
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,360
um but yes we don't we don't have a

1757
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,679
silver bullet i just want as i said to

1758
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,679
find a consistent way so that uh we

1759
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:29,280
don't have to reinvent the wheel every

1760
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,880
time

1761
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,560
so um

1762
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,960
thank you

1763
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,640
okay uh before we move on to human uh

1764
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,040
waymo you have your audio open were you

1765
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,199
wanting to speak

1766
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:44,880
uh yeah

1767
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,120
yes

1768
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:56,250
[Music]

1769
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,679
okay you're done thank

1770
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:01,719
thank you

1771
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:03,520
human

1772
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,719
uh yeah so just to comment on that until

1773
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,239
now what i've been doing at least uh for

1774
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:12,719
the point to multiply policy absolutely

1775
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:15,600
i i have a slide that i try to update

1776
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,360
every single working group with regard

1777
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,080
to

1778
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,560
where the drafts are uh with regard to

1779
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,560
at least this technology

1780
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,520
um

1781
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,920
but the way i was seeing it until now

1782
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,560
again my two cents you know obviously

1783
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,000
open for

1784
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,040
uh conversations and comments uh the way

1785
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,199
i was seeing it right now is that this

1786
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:39,120
piece is exactly like uh unicast and it

1787
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,840
it has worked been working to some

1788
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,040
extent

1789
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,480
uh that

1790
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,800
you know pim is taking the

1791
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:47,600
uh

1792
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,560
the lead in in the multicast technology

1793
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,520
itself uh and when it comes to all these

1794
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,880
other uh bits and pieces for downloading

1795
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,320
the policies

1796
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,400
uh we've been just going to the

1797
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,560
appropriate working group and explaining

1798
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,159
the multicast technology with the

1799
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:06,480
multicast experts that are already

1800
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,159
within those groups

1801
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,400
and from tracking purposes we've just

1802
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,120
been using that first slide

1803
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,080
uh

1804
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,560
not ideal but i just wanted to make sure

1805
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,480
that you know uh everybody knows you

1806
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,280
know how we've been tracking this work

1807
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,880
at least for the point to multiply

1808
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,840
points

1809
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
and i agree and just sort of adding in

1810
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,800
you know

1811
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,640
sort of a high level discussion

1812
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,080
as alvaro saying there's nothing in

1813
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,640
current ietf process that really

1814
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,320
governs how we should be doing this sort

1815
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,840
of thing so this will be partially

1816
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,520
making it up as we go along

1817
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,800
certainly if people have other

1818
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,840
experience in other standards

1819
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,520
organizations about how

1820
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:47,760
such larger work gets coordinated

1821
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,480
we'd be happy to take it

1822
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,760
probably the best thing that we could do

1823
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,679
is much like you're talking about

1824
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:57,360
and pick up uh some level of

1825
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,520
interested parties that are doing this

1826
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,600
cross-area work and to simply make sure

1827
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,280
that they're all talking to each other

1828
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,120
find a common place to write it down

1829
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,880
certainly the wikis are a place that we

1830
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,360
can do so uh but you know figuring out

1831
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,480
where is

1832
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,840
mostly a matter of preference rather

1833
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,840
than of technology

1834
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,239
and you'll pass that point uh as we get

1835
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:17,840
the people talking to each other and get

1836
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,360
all the stuff coordinated

1837
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,159
maybe some sort of organization will

1838
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:25,120
produce itself from that

1839
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:32,560
okay

1840
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,840
so you had your hand up

1841
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:42,080
as soon as you removed your hand

1842
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,719
okay uh thank you for this useful

1843
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:45,840
diversion we'll make sure this gets

1844
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,360
captured in the minutes and i'm sure

1845
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,360
that part of this topic will pop up but

1846
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,560
as part of the routing area general

1847
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,800
meeting is alvaro saying

1848
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,960
our going back to our next presentation

1849
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,440
item number seven uh jordan talking

1850
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,280
about the bgb ls extensions for flood

1851
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:02,280
reflectors

1852
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,840
can you still hear me there we go sorry

so first off thanks for that time to

1856
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,960
speak today um so while the giraffe that

1857
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,360
we're proposing is a pretty simple vgpls

1858
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,400
extension for isis flight reflectors i

1859
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,920
just wanted to spend a few minutes kind

1860
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:26,640
of

1861
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,800
driving some context behind it next

1862
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,840
slide please

1863
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,960
um so the problem we're trying to solve

1864
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,320
um i think we all know that you know

1865
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,400
flat single area igps come with some

1866
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,400
pitfalls you know lots of flooding every

1867
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,400
node needs to know it lots of state

1868
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,159
every node has to remember and maintain

1869
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:46,560
it and then you know convergence right

1870
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,120
every node has to do the computation and

1871
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,199
this just gets worse as the network

1872
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:52,640
scale but

1873
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,080
there are some

1874
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,600
you know desirable properties for that

1875
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,440
you know especially with deployments

1876
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,000
things like sr

1877
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,719
next slide please

1878
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,760
so just trying to visualize it a little

1879
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:11,280
bit um just a you know example topology

1880
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,760
relatively small flat level two isis

1881
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,159
network you know stable flooding domain

1882
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:18,159
um but as the network grows and grows

1883
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:20,000
scale becomes more of a concern so you

1884
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,520
know again just kind of driving some

1885
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,520
more specificity to what was mentioned

1886
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,880
you know lots of state you know have to

1887
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,640
maintain adjacencies i have to maintain

1888
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,480
a larger lsdb

1889
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,719
lots of flooding to distribute uh all

1890
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:32,400
that link state information and then

1891
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,800
convergence right more runs longer run

1892
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,199
times and that just gets compounded by

1893
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:39,199
the higher resource utilization required

1894
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:40,880
for that

1895
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,600
and next slide

1896
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,080
and what's the solution isis flood

1897
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,480
reflection of course um so there is this

1898
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,960
is based on existing work in lsr it's

1899
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,840
been adopted

1900
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:56,239
um but basically photograph

1901
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:57,760
yeah sorry flood reflectors are a little

1902
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,679
bit like bgp route reflectors and that

1903
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:01,520
we you know we choose a cluster id we

1904
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,280
designate one or more flood reflectors

1905
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,199
and then we designate one or more flood

1906
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,960
reflector clients

1907
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,960
um next slide

1908
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,040
okay so let's kind of visualize and put

1909
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,199
everything together so uh we basically

1910
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:18,719
split the

1911
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:20,800
level two into multiple flooding domains

1912
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,239
and that basically just means we take

1913
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:23,840
level one and level two

1914
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,719
um and we establish flood reflector

1915
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:28,960
adjacencies in level two so we have the

1916
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,320
flood reflectors at the top flood

1917
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,159
reflector clients at the bottom and we

1918
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:33,920
use that level one in the middle for

1919
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:35,040
transit

1920
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,640
one way to do this is

1921
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,280
leaking the l2 routes from tier one into

1922
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,800
level one but there's some other methods

1923
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,480
to finding the draft but the overall

1924
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,159
result is that level one and level two

1925
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:46,880
can now converge independently

1926
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,520
uh next slide

1927
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,080
just a quick kind of before and after i

1928
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,920
just think it helps show you know if you

1929
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,920
consider larger topologies how this

1930
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,320
could you know

1931
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:03,760
how this uh sort of work is beneficial

1932
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,560
uh next slide

1933
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:10,719
and just a real quick thing here um

1934
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:12,159
did we actually improve all the scaling

1935
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:14,960
considerations uh yeah definitely so you

1936
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,159
know if we consider just a simple

1937
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:17,760
topology of six level one level two

1938
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,440
nodes without flood reflection we would

1939
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,600
need you know 15 adjacencies and level

1940
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,600
two but with the flood reflection we uh

1941
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,199
two flood reflectors to the top four

1942
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:27,040
clients at the bottom we only need eight

1943
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,280
and that gets us out of redundancy two

1944
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:32,519
next slide

1945
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:37,280
and while the uh the other factors you

1946
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:40,719
know vary per implementation you know uh

1947
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:43,600
hardware network size etc um we do know

1948
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,600
that you know less links and adjacencies

1949
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,840
mean less lspdues less lspd using less

1950
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,320
flooding and therefore less spf

1951
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,239
computation

1952
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:55,120
and next slide

1953
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:57,120
and finally this point so thanks for

1954
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,040
bearing with me um basically we're just

1955
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,560
asking for

1956
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,679
um some bgpl sclvs from the node link

1957
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:05,520
and prefix and attribute descriptor

1958
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,199
registry just so we can kind of convey

1959
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:09,280
that information about flood reflection

1960
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,520
topologies to the controllers

1961
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,159
um it's pretty straightforward there and

1962
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:17,040
last slide

1963
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,840
uh so what's next so with the existing

1964
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,760
uh the existing flood reflection work

1965
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,520
already being adopted we are asking for

1966
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:28,000
adoption here for this draft

1967
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,480
and while the specific definitions of

1968
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,719
how the tlbs are used are already

1969
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:34,400
identified there we'll do a little bit

1970
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,239
of supplemental additions to kind of

1971
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:39,199
describe how it's used for bgpls

1972
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:43,839
and as always comments are welcome

1973
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,040
that's it okay

1974
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,639
thank you for the presentation we have

1975
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:50,560
plenty of time in the queues do we have

1976
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,239
any questions and while we're waiting

1977
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:54,080
for any hands to go up

1978
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,920
this is a place where i'll note that uh

1979
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,920
you know we have had discussions with

1980
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,560
lsr and you know it's perfectly fine to

1981
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,400
have a separate bgp document you know we

1982
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,120
could also have unified you know bgp ls

1983
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,239
extensions and lsr documents

1984
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:11,520
and it's non-controversial to have no

1985
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,600
feature pop up in bgp after it's already

1986
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,400
been through lsr

1987
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,960
we still have no questions so thank you

1988
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,480
for the presentation

1989
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:27,360
well you're welcome thanks

1990
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,600
this moves us to our last presentation

1991
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:32,960
and since we are remarkably on time this

1992
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,040
session we have room for further

1993
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,560
discussion afterwards if that is

1994
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,639
people's desire

1995
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:41,600
next presentation is going to be

1996
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,840
on extensions for link band with

1997
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,239
extended communities

1998
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,960
hi can you hear me

1999
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,600
we can hear you

2000
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:07,040
uh okay uh here we go

2001
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,239
my topic is the intention of the living

2002
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:15,320
department-wise method studies please

2003
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,120
okay

2004
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,920
there there are some problems in using

2005
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:34,000
pgp link button wise one os is now uh

2006
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,960
encoded again uh you you attended the

2007
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,960
community attribute using

2008
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,960
uh c2 bits of rhodium phonotype

2009
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,360
here we have a brief introduction to

2010
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,600
data type of conversion

2011
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,719
as shown in in the figure in

2012
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:52,320
protein point

2013
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,040
numbers fraction determines the

2014
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,360
precision the size of a number depends

2015
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,320
on

2016
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:02,639
exponents so when the value you see the

2017
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:03,520
the

2018
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:08,639
uh 24 21st part of two it can uh it may

2019
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:11,600
no longer be accurate after conversion

2020
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:15,600
to full of loading points from format

2021
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,159
another place

2022
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,639
okay

2023
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:33,520
the

2024
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,480
implementation of the floating component

2025
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,120
conversion makers some problem and the

2026
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:42,639
way how we had a problem earlier i'll

2027
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:46,320
show you in the figure establish a bgp

2028
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,360
share relationship between rotary and

2029
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,440
router b router

2030
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:55,760
uh configure a uh export policy for bgp

2031
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,880
pl the policy contains said link upon

2032

2059
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:11,679
necessary please

2060
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,040
okay proposal is

2061
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,880
used to use the

2062
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,400
convenience of units and unsigned

2063
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,840
integers to accurately represent the

2064
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,719
banana wise value such as a link

2065
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:34,080
compound wise

2066
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:37,199
you see in bts units

2067
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:38,480
and so on

2068
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,600
uh here we have some simple usage and

2069
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,920
should as shown in the figure routine

2070
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,120
configure

2071
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,320
x

2072
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,280
configure access policy for pgpr the

2073
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,920
policy contains a set of

2074
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,120
uh

2075
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:59,040
incompanies the 1 500

2076

bits per second

2078
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,800
on rotary b the link of analyze value is

2079
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:08,000
obtained directly avoids the problems

2080
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,840
with the floating points of it

2081
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,800
necessary please

2082
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,639
okay

2083
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:20,960
uh welcome convenience and the

2084
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:24,960
discussion that's all thank you

2085
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:31,639
ac you have to make fun

2086
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,520
systems

2087
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,639
uh i um

2088
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:40,560
i've never really liked the floating

2089
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,960
point but i'm wondering

2090
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,159
if

2091
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:46,960
changing it now be i know it was the you

2092
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,520
know the integrated services guys who

2093
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,520
decided it would be a good idea to put

2094
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:54,400
floating point in an rsvp and we've been

2095
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,239
stuck with it ever since

2096
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,719
but i'm wondering if

2097
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:01,280
it'd be a good idea now to change it you

2098
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,639
know it's so we've had it for decades

2099
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:07,199
and this looks really good for like link

2100
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:10,080
bandwidth but once you start using it

2101
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,760
for

2102
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:14,239
re you know things other things like

2103
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:16,400
unreserved or reserved or wherever you

2104
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,639
you know the units you're gonna you're

2105
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:20,320
gonna need

2106
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,159
uh

2107
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:24,159
fractions you know even if you have a if

2108
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:26,639
you have 400 gig to start you know the

2109
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:28,320
pieces of it are going to be different

2110
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,719
units and having all handling all these

2111
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:31,840
units i think

2112
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,400
i think it could get unwieldy i don't

2113
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,320
like like i said i haven't thought about

2114
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,239
it too much and i don't really like the

2115
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:39,760
floating point but i don't know if now

2116
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,719
is the time to change it

2117
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:51,360
so i would actually like to add to and

2118
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,120
add additional things for what ac has

2119
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,360
just said

2120
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,440
floating point as a representation has

2121
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:00,320
been problematic for a lot of reasons uh

2122
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,080
i think my favorite one is that we'll

2123
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:04,159
often get people writing naive

2124
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:05,600
implementations for simple

2125
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,600
software-based controllers and

2126
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,440
they'll stick in something that

2127
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,199
is basically a decimal value so they

2128
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:12,880
keep on trying to use it is something

2129
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,120
that is not floating point

2130
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,080
uh

2131
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:18,400
second problem that i agree with that ac

2132
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:19,440
is brought up

2133
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,440
the floating points that we're using are

2134
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,840
low precision floating points and as a

2135
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,520
consequence sometimes you simply can't

2136
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,199
get a value that correctly represents

2137
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:28,800
what you're trying to do

2138
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,639
and it makes comparisons of things and

2139
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:34,239
elements like policy

2140
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:36,320
very difficult to use

2141
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,880
so there's a lot of bad things about our

2142
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,320
current format

2143
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,080
but the thing i do want to add in is

2144
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,760
that uh

2145
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,320
really two details the first one is that

2146
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:47,760
in your presentation

2147
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,400
you're giving you know many different

2148
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:54,080
types that overlap in terms of behaviors

2149
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,650
forget the correct slide here

2150
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:57,199
[Music]

2151
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:59,360
so as an example uh

2152
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,880
you know as shikhari is pointing out in

2153
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:01,760
chat

2154
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,679
you know part of the question is are

2155
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:06,639
these powers of 10 or you know these uh

2156
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:07,679
you know

2157
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:09,600
closer to standard computer based uh you

2158
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,520
know powers you know 10 24 rather than a

2159
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,520
thousand as an example

2160
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:16,239
but on top of that uh we also have the

2161
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:17,840
detail that

2162
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,920
if you happen to have two bgp

2163
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,840
communities that have overlapping

2164
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,920
semantics just because the units can

2165
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,520
shift around

2166
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,199
you know the generic community code and

2167
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:30,159
most implementations don't know

2168
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:32,320
what they do with that and on top of all

2169
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,920
that

2170
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,840
there's a class of extended community

2171
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:38,560
behaviors that are effectively

2172
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:41,040
singletons you're expected to have you

2173
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,960
know one link bandwidth attached to your

2174
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,880
community as an example and this sort of

2175
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,639
metals the semantics

2176
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:49,120
so i think there's good discussion to be

2177
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,360
had here in terms of can we do better

2178
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,080
for something like link bandwidth

2179
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,760
uh we have to figure out how to answer

2180
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,560
that question as well

2181
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,480
hey see did you have a follow-up

2182
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,159
yeah just one more comment one thing

2183
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:06,320
i've always i've thought many times and

2184
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:09,360
this reminded me of it is

2185
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,199
i think it i think if we're gonna switch

2186
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:12,719
to something it'd be good to switch it

2187
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:14,560
across

2188
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,800
all the places at least in the routing

2189
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,880
area where uh

2190
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:21,520
where link bandwidth is

2191
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:22,320
uh

2192
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,400
encoded in protocols

2193
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,560
and what i what i would use if i were

2194
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,320
gonna if i were if i had the power to

2195
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,719
just you know have a flag day i would

2196
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:34,639
use a 64-bit number that was just bits

2197
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:36,480
per second rather than having all these

2198
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,600
different

2199
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,920
units that i think that that this is

2200
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,440
this is this is

2201
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,280
this is not something that people are

2202
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,679
gonna wanna this wasn't this isn't

2203
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:47,120
something that programmers are gonna

2204
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,960
like i'll put let me put it that way to

2205
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,760
have all the different uh

2206
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:56,120
expression of all these different units

2207
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,199
look andre

2208
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:06,080
that this actually came up in bess

2209
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,920
with when we considered reusing this

2210
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,360
extended community

2211
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:10,480
and

2212
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,560
we ran into very quickly the issue of

2213
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,000
you know specifying

2214
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,159
one gigabit per second or you know unit

2215
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:17,760
gigabit one

2216
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,679
and then uh unit megabit 1000

2217
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:24,159
and uh so in in the the best equivalent

2218
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:25,760
of this actually just normalized to one

2219
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,120
unit

2220
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,800
i think it was megabit per second if i'm

2221
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,719
not mistaken

2222
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:32,400
so the the overlap can actually be

2223
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,800
problematic right so if the

2224
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,440
if the byte value is the same

2225
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:39,040
but or the byte per second value is the

2226
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,639
same but can be expressed in two

2227
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:41,760
different

2228
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:44,320
type comma values then you know what do

2229
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:45,760
you have to define

2230
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:50,199
whether that is a match or not a match

2231
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:03,120
be a good argument for the 64-bit number

2232
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:08,120
of bits per second consistent units

2233
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:21,120
i think our primary consideration from

2234
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,679
not moving to 64 bits at this current

2235
01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:24,719
time

2236
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:26,480
is that people were trying to embed

2237
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,239
these things in extended communities and

2238
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:30,560
had limited space to do so

2239
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,639
so this perhaps moves a different

2240
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:33,920
direction about how do we encode this on

2241
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:37,080
the wire

2242
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,920
okay we can discuss

2243
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,199
overland

2244
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:50,000
as a mail

2245
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,719
i agree and as was pointed out about the

2246
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:54,719
best comment we have

2247
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:56,960
multiple things that are looking at this

2248
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,320
there's a discussion about transitive

2249
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,480
versus non-transitive as well

2250
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,400
so

2251
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,920
certainly thank you for bringing this

2252
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:07,280
draft to idr uh i think it's a good

2253
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,199
conversation to start we're seeing this

2254
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:11,679
again across more than one working group

2255
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:13,440
and perhaps you know this could be part

2256
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,280
of our motivation to do you know better

2257
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:18,920
about linked bandwidth

2258
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:22,480
okay thank you

2259
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,080
okay

2260
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:28,960
we currently have 25 minutes left in our

2261
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,800
time slot

2262
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,639
this is the end of our presentation

2263
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:35,280
materials before i open up

2264
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:36,320
in general

2265
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:39,280
care so did you want to add anything set

2266
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,119
a specific no thing of topic for

2267
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:44,119
discussion

2268
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:52,280
i'm good to go jeff thanks

2269
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,199
okay and sue seems to be having some

2270
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:15,360
difficulties with her microphone

2271
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:18,639
we'll give her one more moment

2272
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,960
i have nothing to add thank you

2273
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,480
thank you

2274
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:29,760
okay uh so that being said uh

2275
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:32,080
we do have open floor time for general

2276
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,840
discussion

2277
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,080
is there a topic that people would like

2278
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,520
to raise to the working group that they

2279
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:38,719
would like a

2280
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:42,920
broader plenary discussion on

2281
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,400
okay well it appears that we have been

2282
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,560
efficient and given that we have people

2283
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:02,080
in many places around the planet that

2284
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,520
would be happier for a little bit of

2285
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,040
extra time off

2286
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:08,080
i move that uh via adjourn our next

2287
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:10,719
scheduled session is for

2288
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:12,080
tomorrow

2289
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:15,119
and it is uh for i believe the

2290
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:17,600
third session of the day

2291
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,679
jeff one other option

2292
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:23,040
just in case since alvaro's here

2293
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,119
did alvaro want to go with his

2294
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:29,360
presentation for tuesday early

2295
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:33,440
alvaro

2296
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:34,960
did you want to

2297
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:38,400
have a little bit more time

2298
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,960
no i'm we're we're fine with going we're

2299
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,639
doing that on thursday

2300
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:46,880
and actually uh yingsan is going to do

2301
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:48,560
the presentation on thursday

2302
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:52,080
okay so we'll then let go i want to i i

2303
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,760
just know sometimes you have a busy

2304
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,000
schedule thank you very much i'll be

2305
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,480
here thank you

2306
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:02,239
okay and our time on thursdays also not

2307
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:04,080
fully scheduled so we should have know

2308
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:07,840
some freedom for discussion as well

2309
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,320
so in that case

2310
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,480
thank you everyone for joining us you'll

2311
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:15,199
pick up again tomorrow

2312
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:19,400
have a good rest of your day for ietf

2313
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,519
