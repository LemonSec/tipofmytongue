00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,640
if you don't mind we'll be

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,720

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,000
okay so we we have uh challenged the

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
network a little bit this time because

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,719
there is some emphasis which is uh

12
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,680
being uh given to the code of conduct so

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,520
let's go through that

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,000
uh as usual your reminder that there are

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,360
number of uh

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,680
not next like previous slide please

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,800
uh as usual you you must be aware of

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,199
the not well of the itf which which

19
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,319

20
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,280
so if you're aware of any ipr

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,640
that that is being discussed in your ipr

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,479
that's been discussed today please

23
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,960
notify the group or the chairs after the

24
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,400

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,960

next slide

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,080

28
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,560
uh the healthy harassment guidelines and

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,280
procedures so uh you as you know we have

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,119
a number of best practices in the ietf

31
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,680
and in particular we care about

32
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,040
respect and respect others and and uh do

33
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,400
not harass

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,040
others as a baseline for the

35
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,040

um

138
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,479
so here is the status we are good on uh

139
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,360
chic

140
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,440
co-op as promised

141
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,840
um

142
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,600
the baseline technologies we have

143
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,800
covered uh laura one and now we have uh

144
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,639
six fox on the work so we're pretty good

145
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,319
um

146
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,440
the data model we appear to be a bit

147
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,639
late

148
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,639
um before we we

149
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,800
decide for another date uh maybe we

150
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,560
should assess the progress and and the

151
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,080
work that has to be done so we'll

152
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,960
discuss with laurent during his talk

153
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,560
and then we have uh lp1 uh chic over sig

154
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,680
fox which which looks in good shape

155
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,840
so juan carlos will tell us about that

156
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,080
next slide please

157
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,240
so that's pretty much where we are as

158
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,319
you can see the uh architecture has not

159
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,039
been worked on and alex will discuss

160
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,600
that but we we plan to to

161
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,039
kick it again

162
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,120
and uh well the other documents are

163
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,960
evolving nicely

164
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,840
next slide

165
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,080
this one is the last one

166
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,319

171
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,759
that everybody will own his own slides

172
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,479
but we uploaded already the slides to

173
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,960
mitico there is this new feature that

174
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,360
alexander is demonstrating right now

175
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,759
um if you look at below your name on the

176
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,160
top left of the screen there there are

177
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,599
there are slides

178
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,440
and the speaker will be uh allowed to uh

179
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,599
if the second button from the left you

180
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,199
you have join q and then you've got this

181
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,000
this page which is kind of

182
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,800
right now about with this you can select

183
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,160
a slide deck within the preloaded slide

184
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,120
decks

185
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,960
and so we'll ask you to select your

186
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,280
slide deck within that and that will

187
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,120
allow you to do the navigation without

188
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
sharing your screen okay we that's the

189
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,360
way we plan to do it and that's exactly

190
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,520
what alexander is doing now with the lp1

191
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,440
architecture which makes under the

192
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,879
believers

193
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,360
yes thank you thank you

194
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,199
and of course if you have any

195
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,680
difficulties with uh actually sharing

196
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
your slides you can just tell tell me

197
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,560
and i'll be changing the slides for you

198
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,520
um so with this one uh and actually

199
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,400
before jumping to the lpn architecture

200
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,370
overview uh i would like to

201
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,960
[Music]

202
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,199
to say a couple of words for our

203
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,479
progress since the last time so uh we

204
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,319
didn't have any we didn't held any

205
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,599
interim meetings and uh of course work

206
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,240
progressed but it progressed at a pace

207
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,240
that's um let's say uh less visible than

208
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,120
uh when we had the interims so this is

209
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,559
why we'll be having interims uh starting

210
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,000
the month of december so there are

211
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,959
already two that have been planned and

212
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,399
more will come

213
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,680
right after

214
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,760
uh so um

215
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,920
we are profiting from this itf to

216
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,399
actually give up give the status of of

217
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,959
uh uh give a little refresher of the

218
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,640
oklahoma architecture

219
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,839
and uh so i think i have a little bit

220
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,600
too much slides for the

221
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,680
a couple of minutes that are left so i'm

222
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,279
just going to go through

223
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,600
like you know the the general

224
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,959
architecture that we have we have the

225
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,480
devices they get the radiogate with the

226
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,519
network gateway and the application uh

227
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,240
server so uh uh this is the architecture

228
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,959
that we have seen the start and just as

229
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,040
a slow as a refresher so we have

230
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,120
different technologies and in each of

231
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,560
the technologies you have like the

232
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,519
specific uh uh terminology per

233
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,920
technology and the the technology the

234
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,160
the terminology that we decided to use

235
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,560
within uh in in the

236
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,440
itf documentation

237
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,600
so this is like a pretty high level

238
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,760
overview uh

239
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,839
of course i'm not going to go over all

240
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,519
the details i mean you have you have

241
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,120
that in the in the slide so you can you

242
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,160
can get back to it to review it but

243
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,000
basically what we

244
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,240
have in this document as of today's the

245
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,440
the point is that we would like to

246
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,120
provide the reference architecture when

247
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,440
we have two modes the one is that the

248
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,200
chic will have the sig device in the

249
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,279
sheet gateway that's like in the in the

250
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,920
more uh traditional iot

251
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,839
setting and then when we have the sheet

252
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,200
peers uh such as in the pvp

253
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,320
uh uh in the ppp document but

254
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,399
yesterday on six law there was this also

255
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,480
this discussion about okay how we how

256
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,399
are we using this uh terminology and how

257
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,800
does that work in mesh networks where

258
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
uh uh there is no uplink and downlink uh

259
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,279
uh uh that is

260
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,680
as clearly defined you know so

261
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,600
these are things that go into this chic

262
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,880
architecture

263
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,800
and of course how

264
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,680
all these things bind together and bind

265
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,760
together with the yang data model

266
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,600
so these are things that are discussed

267
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,040
and that will be discussed more in the

268
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,640
sheik architecture

269
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,399
so uh um

270
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,640
don't be um

271
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,160
also one thing that

272
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,120
uh the authors of the of this document

273
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,880
would like to express is

274
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,600
to not uh to not hesitate to also ping

275
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,560
us to if you have like if you would like

276
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,440
some

277
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,240
issues and some questions treated before

278
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
the other the other ones right because

279
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,920
we also like there is this a lot of

280
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,079
things that we'll need to describe and

281
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,240
um getting some input on what is

282
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
precious for you on the first time is is

283
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,720
of course uh um

284
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,120
quite important for us

285
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,880
so uh yes i mean you have like the

286
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,000
device talking to the network

287
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,760
application how everything works

288
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,720
together

289
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,279
and you know that when

290
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,839
the device talks to the uh to the she

291
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,000
gateway you have the rule manager that

292
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,839
manages the rules and then we have the

293
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,279
the compressor the compressor and the

294
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,200
fragment fragmenter

295
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,560
refragmenter

296
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,680
and we have the same setting but you

297
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,480
know like if it's uh in a more symmetric

298
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,000
view and if it's uh in a shake peer

299
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,639
setting such as the ppp document

300
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,120
so uh with this the next step in the

301
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,959
architectural document and in an

302
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,160
architectural draft and with pascal uh

303
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,800
we are really um ambitious about this

304
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
document so we would like to get it out

305
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,240
i would like to to to get it fast uh uh

306
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,560
in its next steps is really to go

307
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,480
through the life cycle of how

308
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,360
uh

309
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,079
how the the whole chic life cycle uh

310
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,279
works right so please don't hesitate to

311
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,279
to ping us and to ping the developer and

312
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,040
working group on you know what what's

313
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,440
important for you uh and in any case

314
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,079
we'll be advancing it with it in uh like

315
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,360
in in in this general order

316
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,040
so um

317
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,440
do you have any questions or any

318
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,160
suggestions or remarks

319
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,760
i hear no questions and

320
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,120
with this then i will give the floor

321
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,240
to our

322
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,560
next presenter

323
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,680
thank you i was about to

324
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,319
so lauren

325
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,720
i tried

326
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,440
don't see it okay well you you you

327
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,920
select one and you click on it you

328
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,000
should see a list of of slides right a

329
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,040
great list

330
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,959
but i click and it opens another window

331
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,120
so

332
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,399
can you share it and it will

333
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,800
i can i would have liked you to do it

334
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,959
did you double click do press it and

335
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,320
share that

336
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,240
i don't see it so

337
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
when you when you open when it launches

338
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,560
the window you can

339
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,440
okay

340
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,680
has to share but then i

341
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,399
where i do i go

342
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,000
conservative

343
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,199
i don't see my sites

344
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,199
there's a list so so you press the

345
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,079
button

346
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,000
a new window

347
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,560
yes which says choose a deck to share

348
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,800
and then it scrolls

349
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,079
yeah

350
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,560
and here you should see data is the

351
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,279
fourth maybe yes i click on it but it

352
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,959
opened a new window

353
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,199
yes sir it opens something new and then

354
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,639
on the bottom it says shareholder

355
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,279
dismiss sharing blue and dismiss in red

356
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,519
please press share

357
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,240
i don't see it

358
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,680
okay i will do it okay sorry uh

359
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,160
or it's here maybe i'm not in uh okay

360
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,920
so you are sharing maybe i did not allow

361
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,839
you to share let me check because i was

362
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,639
not clicking on

363
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,079
so yes i i'm gonna present the new

364
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,760
version that has been

365
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,279
uploaded into the github repository

366
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,160
and so it's a version that is published

367
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,920
in august

368
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,079
and i will give you the difference

369
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,320
between this version and

370
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,560
the previous one that has been presented

371
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,800
at the during the past etf session so

372
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,240
next slide please

373
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,519
all right

374
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,680
so here so there is a

375
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,560
very some cosmetic things like adding a

376
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,440
dash between the name to be closer

377
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,760
to be better understood and be closer

378
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,440
also to

379
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,519
what we find in rfc

380
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,440
8724

381
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,320
so next slide

382
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,079
so here we have also something that has

383
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,360
been requested

384
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,600
is to use the acronym instead of field

385
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,399
id type we use feed we

386
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,680
use fl to be very close to what we have

387
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,560
in

388
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,839
vrfc

389
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,680
so that's another difference next slide

390
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,360
so

391
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,440
more important change is that

392
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,279
for the

393
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,720
target values

394
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,000
definition

395
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,199
we had a union before between binary and

396
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,160
string and here we remove the string and

397
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,240
we keep only being a riff for two

398
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,920
reasons

399
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,519
the first one is that

400
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,920
it's simpler to manage

401
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,120
and when we will use the data model it

402
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,680
will be easier to determine it's if it's

403
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,199
a binary value

404
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,399
and we

405
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,839
it will be

406
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,680
and we will know the type

407
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,279
by the field

408
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,399
id so we don't need to have two

409
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,720
two things so it's a simplification on

410
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,759
that

411
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,399
next slide

412
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,320
uh

413
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,000
on very simple uh thing also we remove s

414
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,800
to target value because to be current

415
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,120
with the rest of things

416
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,839
so next slide

417
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,399
if i may can you see below the slides

418
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,839
like a

419
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,600
line with the numbers

420
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,120
no

421
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,320
okay

422
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,559
because i pressed something called shelf

423
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,559
preloaded slides so you should grant

424
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,839
preloaded slide or something

425
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,679
okay let me

426
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,400
let

427
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,839
i'll try we'll try with the next

428
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,720
presenter so let's keep on okay so

429
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,799
beyond the other change in the the

430
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,240
container chic

431
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,720
so first we remove what's his

432
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,280
dashed ear there was a version number

433
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,199
but this version number is not in the

434
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,319
rfc

435
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,200
so we remove it to be coherent with the

436
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,559
rfc and we add a new

437
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,520
type

438
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,039
for the rules which is no compression

439
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,919
which is used when no rules are can be

440
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,919
selected

441
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,520
okay next slide

442
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,880
so we had also l2 world that was missing

443
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,679
and is present in the rfc

444
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,320
next line

445
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,400
here we add something that was

446
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,880
required by juan carlos

447
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,440
for the company hack it's the definition

448
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,039
of the behavior

449
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,080
and how the

450
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,559
the acknowledgement is done

451
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,720
either using the rfc8724

452
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,280
or to use the component act that is

453
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,160
defined by the the draft that will be

454
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,320
presented after

455
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,879
next slide

456
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,200
so here

457
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,840
uh that's the definition that has been

458
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,280
added also in um

459
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,440
[Music]

460
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,120
questions at the end or would you like

461
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,760
to have them oh right now if you want no

462
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,840
problem okay so

463
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,919
chair hats off i would like to ask a

464
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,280
question

465
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,520
if you go back to the previous slide

466
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,480
uh

467
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,200
so about the compound deck uh

468
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,520
if i if i remember correctly we said

469
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,840
that this extension will be actually in

470
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,400
the compound pack

471
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,360
draft

472
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,080
as a young extension of the baseline

473
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,280
yang

474
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,679
data model

475
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,200
do i remember correctly or

476
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,880
maybe there is two

477
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,720
two possibilities so what i understood

478
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,559
but maybe i'm wrong

479
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,880
was to ask

480
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,280
in the compound arc document

481
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,080
some

482
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,280
to add things to the young model

483
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,360
but the other approach

484
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,320
could be to extend the

485
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,080
pure the young model only based on 8724

486
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,480
and then we add we augment the model

487
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,440
with a new draft so

488
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,360
i don't i don't

489
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,600
know what what's the best

490
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,039
to do

491
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,600
i i think that we decided that it

492
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,439
needs to we need to have extension

493
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,520
8724 and 8824

494
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,480
so

495
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,080
either we

496
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,000
we expect the other one to be published

497
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,720
soon or we just base it on rfc maybe

498
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,000
it's a better solution but

499
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,120
we can change it it's not a problem

500
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,440
so as long as i remember that that was

501
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,679
also what we discussed was that this

502
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,360
will show how

503
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,679
extensions are done

504
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,520
okay yes that's a training for the

505
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,799
future

506
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,720
yeah i also asked that question on the

507
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,960
mailing list but i had lost my memory

508
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,760
about that point and because yes i saw

509
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,600
that you you are doing something and

510
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,280
juan carlos is also doing something in

511
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,159
his draft uh and it's so

512
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,120
maybe effectively just as alex said just

513
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,440
to to show how you extend

514
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,000
we should not consider at all

515
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,679
um that one carlos is draft in here and

516
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,080
do everything in one galaxy's draft

517
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,799
okay surprised to show how extensions

518
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,559
are that nasal except

519
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,760
okay no problem can do to that

520
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,880
next slide

521
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,120
please

522
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,960
okay so here is more a question but i

523
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,120
already talked to with dominic of that

524
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,080
and we have to update it is that

525
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,919
we had a maximum window size in the past

526
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,440
which was uh

527
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,480
right now

528
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,400
when you define uh

529
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,799
fcn size you can use up to two power

530
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,919
fcn size minus two for the value but you

531
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,000
can also reduce this value

532
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,400
and this is given by this

533
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,280
and i didn't find it in the

534
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,720
llc but

535
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,200
with dominic we locate it in the rfc so

536
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,600
i will have to update also this

537
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,120
this field

538
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,640
if i'm correct

539
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,840
so next slide so what is new also is

540
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,480
that we put relation between the

541
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,960
different leaf in the model

542
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,000
for example here what we say that if you

543
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,240
have a

544
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,440
matching operator so if it's ignore it

545
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
doesn't need a target value

546
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,080
and any of the other cases a target

547
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,720
value has to be defined

548
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,679
and

549
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,159
same thing if we have matching operator

550
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,640
matching opera if we have uh

551
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,400
sorry lsb

552
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,400
uh msb it requires also to have argument

553
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,120
after that so we have this uh two tests

554
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,440
that has been introduced in in the young

555
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,880
model on next slide

556
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,200
and same thing for uh era test for when

557
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,039
we have icon error

558
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,080
we

559
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,440
force only this value tile size and all

560
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,120
these things

561
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,880
to be present only if we are in akon era

562
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,159
next slide

563
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,520
so maybe we can have over relations so

564
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,640
one of them can be for example to test

565
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,600
if the msb argument

566
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,320
is less than the field length because

567
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,080
the ride is not

568
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,320
possible but i don't know how to do it

569
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,840
in young

570
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,280
and

571
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,360
maybe also to check if we have

572
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,799
a

573
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,799
lsb and msb are map send on match

574
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,760
mapping

575
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,640
so

576
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,640
there is a link between these two ones

577
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,960
so we can check it but it's not

578
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,919
specified in the rfc so i don't think

579
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,559
it's useful to to do it

580
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,520
and if you have other ideas of relation

581
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,760
between

582
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,400
information in the data model so please

583
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,799
tell us

584
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,840
next

585
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,520
sign so in conclusion we we have

586
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,240
something that is quite stable now i

587
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,600
accept what you say about uh

588
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,400
componek but uh it will it's very easy

589
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,200
to

590
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,400
to change

591
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,080
so it means that i think it's very

592
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,520
mature now

593
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,600
uh it has also been tested during the

594
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,159
acaton so we introduce

595
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,360
the young model into open chick

596
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,400
and now we're able to transform

597
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,480
json open cheek format

598
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,880
to the young model the

599
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,000
format

600
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,039
so and we use also yongsan which is a

601
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,520
python module to check the variability

602
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
of the rule and to check the link

603
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,400
between the value in the data model and

604
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,000
it works well

605
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,240
so it's uh it has been pushed to them

606
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,880
to the open cheek repository but

607
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,120
it needs to be finalized but

608
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
it's in a good way

609
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,320
and finally next slide

610
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,600
so the next slide is an example of this

611
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,799
i think

612
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,880
yes so here is a cheek data model on

613
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,080
next slide

614
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,320
is what we get with the young data model

615
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,600
to represent part of the rule

616
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,000
and the next slide is the relation

617
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,520
between all the

618
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,679
the draft so here we have to change but

619
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,200
my my view was to integrate things uh if

620
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,320
we just keep the thing in green so if we

621
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,720
will go to the young data model and what

622
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
is in the range so

623
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,440
who i am and the component will be

624
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,840
extension of the basic data model

625
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,279
that's all and here is

626
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,760
a summary of what we

627
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,120
we have done an unchanged in the

628
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,990
in the young tree

629
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:45,039
[Music]

630
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,559
do we have any more questions

631
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,559
um

632
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,039
about

633
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,400
so for me it's ready to be shown

634
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,799
even if we

635
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,520
extend the model and remove component

636
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,440
and we put it in over the things it

637
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,720
doesn't change

638
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,760
the philosophy of the model so we

639
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,159
it's ready to

640
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,000
to be reviewed

641
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,640
so do you so think that you can have a

642
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,480
working group last call by the end of

643
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,240
the year

644
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,679
or before

645
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,360
before

646
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,080
okay so actually a question to to our

647
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,480
heidi here eric

648
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,080
what's the step when we want to do a

649
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,679
group let's go and we want to have a

650
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,520
validation by the young doctor can that

651
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,000
be done at the same time or do we need

652
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,720
to do first young and then

653
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,120
the last

654
00:26:51,679 --> 00:27:11,360
i call

655
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,440
or if it's background noise but it seems

656
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,679
that you're far from your microphone

657
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,679
and and sometimes it works sometimes

658
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,600
does not it was not coming very well to

659
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,640
me i don't know for the others

660
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,440
okay i will try to come closer and speak

661
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,679
slower

662
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,440
it's good now

663
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,919
process wise you can do both at the same

664
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:32,799
time

665
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,320
and typically during the working group

666
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,399
last call you can ask as well

667
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,799
the young doctor's review

668
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,360
if we are confident into the young model

669
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,120
that's the way to go

670
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,720
else if you are unsure about the young

671
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,440
model itself then it's better to think

672
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,279
to go to the young doctor first because

673
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,039
if they need to change

674
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,399
uh then we need

675
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,919
of course to to do everything good class

676
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,320
called other change

677
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,840
it's basically a matter of confidence

678
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,279
it went through the yongsan tool

679
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,000
um and and anyway the group itself i

680
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,080
mean we can check the data but the

681
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,919
structure i know we cannot give much

682
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,200
feedback

683
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,480
so

684
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,399
and it went to the young doctors right a

685
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,399
couple of months ago

686
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,279
well

687
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,000
that was what it was

688
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,960
yes

689
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,279
it went to a young daughter but i

690
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,480
uh

691
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,399
i think he has no more time to review

692
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,159
the document

693
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,320
so we have to find another doctor

694
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:41,919
and

695
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,320
i think it was with your help right you

696
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,120
were the one who actually triggered that

697
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,919
so

698
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,440
you you did it but i explained you to

699
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
how to do it oh that's what's how it

700
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,200
happened because i don't remember

701
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,960
i could have done that okay

702
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,200
so should i do the same again then i

703
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,279
guess yeah

704
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,960
my understanding is lauren will need to

705
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,960
make a minor fixes

706
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,480
in the coming days

707
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,320
so once it's done then ask the young

708
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,399
doctors

709
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,959
okay my suggestion

710
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,880
and do you know how much time that takes

711
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,600
approximately

712
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,799
is it a matter of weeks or a matter of

713
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,559
till the end of year

714
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,039
you should you should ask

715
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,440
uh for

716
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,640
let's say two weeks revision

717
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,039
okay and that's they really do it right

718
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,080
it's pretty much like any directorate

719
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,799
they act like a director it depends on

720
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,320
the goodwill

721
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,159
and normally it will be easier because i

722
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,919
follow all the

723
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,880
comments he made about the presentation

724
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,600
and also to add relation with between

725
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,520
data so

726
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,360
i think it's in a better shape than

727
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,479
before the first review

728
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,279
cool many thanks lauren

729
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,120
i guess we need to move on with the next

730
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,640
and uh the next will be juan carlos

731
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,039
can you jump to the q1 carlos i will try

732
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,120
again to give you

733
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,360
uh

734
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,120
the

735
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,879
the access to the decks so

736
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,600
uh yeah it's coming it's coming

737
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,520
yeah

738
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,880
right it works

739
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,760
all right so hello everyone um

740
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,919
juan carlos here and i'm going to

741
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,559
present together with sergio about the

742
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,039
the latest updates on the

743
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,799
shakeover sick fox

744
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,120
just as a reminder since uh what has

745
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,240
happened since ietf 111

746
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,919
we first made a revision from five to

747
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,679
six where we added the

748
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,840
sheet compound dac mechanism then we had

749
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,360
the discussion

750
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,120
about what to do with this compound act

751
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,679
to make it generic and following the

752
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,240
decision from the group we made it

753
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,799
a separate document so from six to seven

754
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,279
we split the compound dac as a generic

755
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,559
mechanism

756
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,080
and the young model description was

757
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,760
added to the sheet compound deck and

758
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,279
just as a reminder we are going to talk

759
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,519
about the compound like right after this

760
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,000
but now we are i'm talking about the the

761
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,600
chicory sig fox

762
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,720
so

763
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,919
then uh after doing that split uh from

764
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,919
revolution seven to eight we added some

765
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,159
uh more normative references to the

766
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,320
compound dac of course and the usage

767
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,600
that has to be

768
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,519
done in chico versus sigfox

769
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,159
together with signaling examples and

770
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,559
abort uh definitions so that's mainly

771
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,640
what we have concentrated in this last

772
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,880
version of the sheikh overseek fox

773
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,320
then there were some

774
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,600
events in the hackathon and i would let

775
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,960
sergio

776
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,880
speak over them

777
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,640
hello we did a

778
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,519
small hackathon with the cheek over

779
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,279
sigfox draft the idea was to to propose

780
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,919
a real case scenario in this case we

781
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,399
talked about a mini weather station and

782
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,720
the objective was to measure at least

783
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,559
temperature and humidity

784
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,519
and send it via a json file to

785
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,399
well while using check over stick fox

786
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,200
in this case we use the dilopi and the

787
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,399
pythons

788
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,320
and the codebase that we use is the one

789
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,159
that is in g top right now that is the

790
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,240
cheek over sigfox project

791
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,880
next slide please

792
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,960
uh in the results that we got well we

793
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,440
implemented the solution using two

794
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,480
threads one thread was used to to do all

795
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,919
the sensing

796
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,840
and the other thread was used to handle

797
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,200
all that she covered sig fox

798
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,039
communication all the fragmentation

799
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,200
transmissions retransmissions

800
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,519
and we connected both threads using a

801
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,559
list

802
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,039
in this case there you can see the

803
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,240
json file format we use two examples the

804
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,120
first ones the first one also send

805
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,840
temperature humidity battery voltage and

806
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,799
light

807
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,880
and the second one on this then

808
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,760
only got that temperature and humidity

809
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,080
uh the first the first case we got seven

810
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,840
cheek fragments that is exactly one

811
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,919
window and in the second case we got

812
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,720
four cheek fragments and well on the

813
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,799
right you can see the the results in

814
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,559
case one there are there are the

815
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,799
fragment compressed numbers and uh

816
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,080
and the payload

817
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,720
and in case to we can see the payload

818
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,799
already reconstructed and how we were

819
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,039
able to graph all the temperature and

820
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,240
humidity

821
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,840
and we got like nice results

822
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,240
thank you

823
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,679
thanks for healing uh so

824
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,279
yeah with that

825
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,200
what we are doing now is verifying this

826
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,919
latest details on the implementation

827
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,600
we would like to probably test one more

828
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,480
use case which is the asset tracking

829
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,640
but otherwise uh we believe it's

830
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,159
advancing well this um this draft

831
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,760
uh something that we need to keep in

832
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,040
mind as

833
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,199
is the dependencies and we just spoke

834
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,399
about the the the one for young

835
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,239
in the sheet compound deck

836
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,239
well we have to bear in mind that this

837
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,560
draft also has dependency on the sheet

838
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,560
compound act so there's a triple

839
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,760
dependency there that we need to

840
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,199
advance

841
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,480
um i'm going to share now the the

842
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,639
the next slide for the compound knack on

843
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,079
and meanwhile

844
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,560
are there any questions about the chic

845
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,440
oversig fox

846
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,599
so yes the the maybe the question is do

847
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,079
you think that the document is now ready

848
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,079
for working with glasgow because it

849
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,679
seems to me that

850
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,920
it's being

851
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,160
you know it's being quite

852
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,400
steady and with some implementations

853
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,000
already you know for some time now

854
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,960
um

855
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,760
the

856
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,000
document i mean we still added a few a

857
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,720
few more details and

858
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,920
i guess

859
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,240
once we have the other two documents

860
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,800
stable the young and the compound act

861
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,280
or in our case the compound neck then

862
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,359
then we will be able to to make the the

863
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,560
changes and and do a last call so we're

864
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,040
really close to it we just want to make

865
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,040
sure that the the dependencies are are

866
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,200
stable enough so that we can make the

867
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,000
correct adjustments okay so so you're

868
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,320
making reference to the compound ack in

869
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,160
the sequence document

870
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,640
yeah that's right so we make it a

871
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,560
normative reference and then

872
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,640
we want to make sure that compound lack

873
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,240
is stable enough so

874
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,240
so that we can move

875
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,599
thank you

876
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,760
okay

877
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,599
so now moving on to the to the compound

878
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,040
deck

879
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,359
again this uh

880
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,400
it started as um as uh definition

881
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,000
examples that were added to she covered

882
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,680
six folks and revision six

883
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,800
and then this um decision was made to to

884
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,280
make this draft uh separate

885
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,880
we implemented

886
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,520
the chic compound dac and we have tested

887
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,599
it over sig fox

888
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,320
uh we posted the draft applying to

889
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,680
generic

890
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,640
lp1 technologies in july

891
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,599
and we may we did a small revision in

892
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,320
october 2021

893
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,359
so

894
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,839
since then we had a last call that was

895
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:34,960
held uh

896
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,400
at the end of october beginning of

897
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,640
november 2021

898
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,480
and uh we got um some feedback from

899
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,839
dominique

900
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:44,640
uh

901
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,560
just recently

902
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,920
so um oh and from me actually

903
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,800
um

904
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,480
in my review

905
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,320
there's this discussion about the data

906
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,880
model and and we discussed it again

907
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,079
today

908
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,440
uh what i would really like to see is is

909
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,079
lauren to actually look at the data

910
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,520
model piece that you have in the

911
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,839
component hack as part of the war group

912
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,440
let's go

913
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,680
laura if you could please do that

914
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,839
go ahead just just speak low yeah

915
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,079
here so

916
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,079
we already did it

917
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,320
okay so you're happy with because i see

918
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,160
that you still kept

919
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,280
in both places i was like uh is is this

920
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,560
is this thing

921
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,079
no yeah

922
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,800
i was confused because i thought

923
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,839
in the

924
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,320
component we just say you have what you

925
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,280
have to add to the young data model

926
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,440
and here it's to have something that is

927
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,480
independent so we will change that

928
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,119
okay okay

929
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,920
because of my comments that will be part

930
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,520
of the one goplus call resolution

931
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,720
actually

932
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,959
right

933
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,720
so um

934
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,440
otherwise we we well there was a last

935
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,760
call then that would just ended and um

936
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,520
as i was saying that there besides these

937
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,960
dependencies there was some feedback

938
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,560
from from dominic

939
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,720
she made a couple of interesting points

940
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,000
i don't know if dominique you want to

941
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,240
yes

942
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,400
yeah i don't know do you want to discuss

943
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,040
it now do we have time and did you have

944
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,640
time to read the comments otherwise we

945
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,480
can take that offline

946
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,440
but

947
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,520
i was curious for example if you use the

948
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,520
compressed version of the bitmaps in

949
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,599
your sigfox implementation

950
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,040
because

951
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,040
i don't quite understand this how this

952
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,280
would work

953
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,280
yeah circuit do you want to comment on

954
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,160
that

955
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,440
yes

956
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,760
i wanted to to comment uh yeah actually

957
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,520
i think that the compressed bitmap is

958
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,200
not supported for the intermediate

959
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,880
windows in this case

960
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,000
as the bitmap should be a fixed uh field

961
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,119
size

962
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,000
so yeah uh we need to to fix that to to

963
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,920
make sure it says that

964
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,400
only the last bitmap can be compressed

965
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,640
actually we were looking at that the

966
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,400
last bitmap can be compressed but

967
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,880
intermediate bitmap should be off right

968
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,359
because it needs to be written in in the

969
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,400
draft

970
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,320
yeah

971
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,880
yeah we will we will check it

972
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,000
thanks for the feedback

973
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,359
in my review there's also this question

974
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,440
about nxd are you the famous

975
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,640
straightforward xd of the chic rfc

976
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,880
which says what you need to provide in

977
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,480
the profiles

978
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,720
and in the document you seem to indicate

979
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,320
that there are some things which should

980
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,320
be in the profile but then there is no

981
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,599
no such list

982
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,280
as you know here is the extension to an

983
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,240
xd

984
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,320
and it would be nice to see it more

985
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,040
explicitly

986
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
remember the list of things that have to

987
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,760
be in the profile for every technology

988
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,560
at some point you're saying uh by memory

989
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,760
um

990
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,160
what was that

991
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
oh man i forgot but but look at my

992
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,480
review and basically i believe there

993
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,640
should be a little section that would be

994
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,400
complete nxt

995
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,400
that's pretty much where i am

996
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,160
okay yeah you're talking about the thing

997
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,000
about that

998
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,920
yes the company draft

999
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,160
there should be i'm sorry because this

1000
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,560
is yes that's about the company

1001
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,359
the last call of the company

1002
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,119
okay okay

1003
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,520

all right so we will respond anyway to

1005
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,440
the to the comments from dominic in

1006
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,400
detail on the making list but

1007
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,480
if there are no more comments uh i think

1008
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,720
this is it

1009
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,400

so yeah that that will be the the next

1011
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,800
thing the respond to the comments and uh

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,880
you know integrate the part that comes

1013
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,880
from the on the yang

1014
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,240
yang model

1015

yes and eric would like to

1017
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,800
uh maybe you can add a point on on this

1018
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,720
so do we keep the working group the open

1019
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,200
class call open or do we yeah just just

1020
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,480
remember my email of yesterday

1021
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,800
uh i have at the point of time there

1022
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,680
were no review then dominican pascal has

1023
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,839
done some review but having a third

1024
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,599
review by the working group should

1025
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,280
really show that the working group is

1026
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,359
behind these documents and i understand

1027
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,680
that's very focused and very initial

1028
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,400
document but if having anybody not

1029
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,640
specific in sick fox reading it and

1030
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,800
commenting yes it's nice it's enough

1031
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,240
right i mean but do it right review it

1032
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,319
then say even if you don't need to have

1033
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,560
comments very long comments

1034
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,839
to make a review

1035
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,319
so please review

1036
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,800
yes and and thank you eric for for for

1037
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,480
that uh uh

1038
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,319
for that precision for that uh

1039
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,680
clarification

1040
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,040
um do you think that we'll need to

1041
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,520
to to to do a second working class call

1042
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,520
if there is a yang

1043
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,560
part included in that document

1044
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,520
or is this i don't think so it's it it's

1045
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,200
kind of minor uh exchange

1046
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,800
i don't want to diminish the value of it

1047
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,800
right but it's not changing the protocol

1048
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,079
itself

1049
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,560
yes yes yes yes exactly and then so no

1050
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,160
need to do a

1051
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,240
good class call address the command and

1052
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,560
then request publication

1053
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,319
okay perfect thank you very much eric

1054
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,720
so thanks uh thanks a lot carl so that

1055
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,200
was uh that was pretty clear so next

1056
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,640
step on the meeting is uh

1057
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,400
recovering the iot and i'm going to

1058
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,720
switch to to to

1059
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,040
present for for and i'm going to just

1060
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,640
show the slides and

1061
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,319
tell me like next um

1062
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,200
next slide whenever you

1063
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,640
whenever you uh want it to be changed

1064
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,480
thank you alex hello

1065
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,359
uh well i will present this new version

1066
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,960
for nviot next slide please

1067
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,440
uh we received some comments from the

1068
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,880
mailing list

1069
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,680
principally from evo and lauren

1070
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,800
so we have put all these new inputs

1071
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,119
in this sixth version next slide please

1072
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,520
the the most important changements are

1073
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,839
the terminology

1074
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:24,839
where

1075
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:29,359
we use now the terminology from ietf

1076
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,400
so

1077
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,240
instead of user equipment we put device

1078
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,240
and for the node v we put radio gateway

1079
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,760
and then for the network gateways i

1080
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,880
leave

1081
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,000
the

1082
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,319
i put network gateways

1083
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,119
together with the name of the

1084
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,480
get get the network gateway of the

1085
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,640
nviot because if not uh i have to put uh

1086
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,040
network guideway one two three four five

1087
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,319
and so forth so it was better to leave i

1088
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,800
think it was better to leave the name

1089
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,880
together with the

1090
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,800
network gateway

1091
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,920
for these

1092
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,079
devices

1093
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,920
next slide please

1094
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,960
the other changes is that instead of

1095
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,480
putting

1096
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,200
i

1097
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,480
i

1098
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,680
eliminate the idea of uh

1099
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,800
control plane and use airplane and

1100
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,680
and the stratus so i the architecture

1101
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,599
now is very flat

1102
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,920
but this means that um

1103
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,800
each network gateway will be a very

1104
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,000
principal

1105
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,240
device in the architecture

1106
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,640
and so the network

1107
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,599
mme and the network gateway

1108
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:50,800
csgw that normally are in the same

1109
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,280
uh are in the same device

1110
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,920
and now 2d device different devices

1111
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,880
because

1112
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,280
their connections are different one will

1113
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,800
be for

1114
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,440
a very small

1115
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,760
bandwidth with the mme

1116
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,599
and the other is a normal radio

1117
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,599
connection with data for the csgw

1118
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,880
so

1119
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,040
that's the most important

1120
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,839
changes in this new version next slide

1121
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,160
please

1122
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,240
and what we want to add to this document

1123
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,960
that we want to work now is

1124
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,880
the manage for some profiles in order to

1125
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,280
take into account the delay tolerant

1126
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,119
transfer objects

1127
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:37,920
so

1128
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,240
this is something new that we

1129
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,799
we plan to work from now

1130
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,359
because we think that is

1131
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,400
is something that can be uh interesting

1132
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,839
for 3gpp

1133
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,120
in order to

1134
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,920
[Music]

1135
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,640
to take chick in the

1136
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,839
in their

1137
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,440
in their architectures

1138
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,240
and that's it

1139
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,439
do you have some questions

1140
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,240
and thank you for doing all that work uh

1141
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,920
together with your co-authors i'm

1142
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,839
actually simplifying in

1143
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:20,560
the

1144
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,640
3gbp architecture and expressing it with

1145
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,280
uh itf terminology

1146
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,280
on my side i

1147
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,880
i like

1148
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,880
this the way it's presented

1149
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,839
um

1150
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,000
i i'm not really sure about the the

1151
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,280
future work that you that you are saying

1152
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,800
it i'll be really interested in

1153
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,910
following up to that so thank you

1154
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:42,989
[Music]

1155
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,720
yes he's here

1156
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,359
just some noise

1157
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,119
ah so maybe he'll he'll reconnect

1158
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,920
so uh uh anna uh if i understand

1159
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,160
correctly uh you've addressed a lot of

1160
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,240
the the detail a lot of the issues until

1161
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,480
now and uh

1162
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,480
one of the points right now is for you

1163
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,800
to address new

1164
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,960
element and you will then

1165
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,880
consider that it's ready for working

1166
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,359
ursula

1167
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,319
so one point that we were discussing

1168
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,160
with edgar this monday

1169
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,599
is that

1170
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,400
this new this version six is really

1171
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,920
ready for

1172
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,520
rascal

1173
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,240
but if we want to work with light color

1174
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,319
and transfer objects

1175
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,880
then it's not ready we need to work this

1176
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,240
part so we work in a new document in a

1177
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,960
version two documents or we do it

1178
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,240
in this

1179
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,839
version six

1180
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,040
so

1181
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,400
okay so

1182
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,839
there is also edgar that is joining now

1183
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:06,960
yeah yes

1184
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,960
can you hear me now yes now it's good

1185
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,319
thank you

1186
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:11,359
great

1187
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:14,480
yeah the the idea is that uh i think we

1188
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,160
are having a challenge

1189
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,680
to get chick in narow van iot

1190
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,760
into epp

1191
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,680
it has a little bit to do with the

1192
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,680
ecosystem

1193
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:32,480
adoption of narrowband iot in general

1194
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,400
because um

1195
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,960
somehow the ecosystem

1196
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,319
is some

1197
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:39,599
is behind

1198
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,040
the

1199
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,119
um

1200
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,119
let's say the standard

1201
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,920
so the implementation of narrowband iot

1202
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,200
and in general uh the the implementation

1203
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,919
of cellular

1204
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,640
cellular iot

1205
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,680
is uh is behind what it has been

1206
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,359
standardized

1207
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:04,160
so then uh

1208
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,800
somehow um

1209
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,800
there is a reluctancy

1210
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,559
and again uh

1211
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,760
maybe this is a personal reflection

1212
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,839
there is a

1213
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:17,920
reluctancy to standardize

1214
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,520
additional features

1215
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,280
for

1216
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,640
cellular massive cellular devices

1217
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,760
because

1218
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,839
they haven't been catch up by the

1219
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,520
implementers

1220
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,480
with the

1221
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,440
current

1222
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,440
standard

1223
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,400
so

1224
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,440
we would like to bring some kind of

1225
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,079
carrot for chic

1226
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,000
so that we bring to the standard to 3gpp

1227
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,200
reasons

1228
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,440
so that we say hey guys if you take chic

1229
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,839
there is this additional motivation for

1230
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,760
you

1231
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,599
so that

1232
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,240
you can include it in the standard and

1233
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,160
in addition to that you are going to

1234
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,640
solve a big a huge problem that right

1235
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,520
now

1236
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,400
the terminals are having in cellular iot

1237
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,440
which is firm firmware's update over the

1238
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,200
air

1239
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,119
and that's the reason for the delay

1240
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,160
tolerant feature so we thought that if

1241
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,040
we helped to solve that problem which is

1242
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,720
a huge problem at the pro at the moment

1243
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,440
so then we could have a uh

1244
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,319
one

1245
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,359
additional um let's say motivation

1246
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,559
to push this feature through three epp

1247
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,200
so that that is part of this uh

1248
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,839
motivation to bring up this to the to

1249
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:42,240
the draft

1250
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,760
many thanks

1251
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,680
that's that's very enlightening now guys

1252
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,920
we we have 10 minutes to finish and we

1253
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,440
have two more presentations we are

1254
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,240
straight on time but we need to move on

1255
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,720
um dominic if you don't mind

1256
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,680
the floor is yours

1257
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,839
okay can you can you try to present your

1258
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,400
slides try to go to share preloaded

1259
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,760
slides

1260
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,599
that's two share slides

1261
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,880
yes sharp related slides no top left yes

1262
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,119
okay

1263
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,000
oh perfect working okay so now you see

1264
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,520
this on the bottom you can move the

1265
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,280
slides

1266
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,839
um

1267
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,440
okay

1268
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,200
you should be thinking about

1269
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,559
yeah with girls does that work yeah

1270
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:31,839
um

1271
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,240
so yeah after years of working on

1272
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,400
chickens this is a happy time where you

1273
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,960
see adoption and so i wanted to report

1274
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,280
about that so that we can celebrate

1275
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,480
um

1276
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,760
so we're not it's not quite complete but

1277
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,400
pretty good shape at the royal lines

1278
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,480
and the the first driving use case is uh

1279
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,760
dlms over lower one so the lms is widely

1280
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,040
used in the

1281
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,680
energy metering um

1282
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,040
world for electricity and gas meters

1283
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,880
and

1284
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,359
the dlms association wanted to be able

1285
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:11,200
to use r1 as a transport for

1286
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,640
energy metering

1287
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,119
and the question was how to do that how

1288
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,960
to standardize

1289
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,640
that

1290
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,520
transport and so there was

1291
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,440
there is already a dlms over udp of ipv6

1292
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,480
stack

1293
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,200
and so the proposal was set to use check

1294
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,200
over r1 to compress udp and ipv6

1295
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,640
and that's

1296
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,680
what

1297
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,119
was adopted

1298
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,040
and so

1299
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,160
the nice thing is that you hardly have

1300
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,160
anything new to

1301
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,280
specify

1302
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,960
everything is already

1303
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,400
in place just stitch the pieces together

1304
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,599
and so a technical speed specification

1305
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,920
is being written right now at the

1306
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,440
lower lines

1307
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,079
and just to say how this works and

1308
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,319
basically the spec is just a few pages

1309
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:03,359
it says

1310
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,920
you shall use

1311
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,480
rfc8724 rfc9011

1312
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,800
and that's about it

1313
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,040
we do a few

1314
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,880
additional specifications that you might

1315
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,240
be interested in

1316
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,040
uh one is to recommend shorter

1317
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,359
inactivity and retransmission timers and

1318
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:25,280
then the defaults expressed in 1911

1319
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,559
to sharpen the latency a little bit and

1320
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:29,839
also

1321
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,240
we recommend to

1322
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,119
as you know 8724 doesn't doesn't say

1323
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,440
what to do in case multiple compression

1324
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,880
rules match

1325
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,480
it just says

1326
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,800
pick one that matches and so in this

1327
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,599
document we say pick one that minimizes

1328
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,200
the compression

1329
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,640
residue so that the messages are shorter

1330
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,720
um and that's it

1331
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,200
that's what's in the document

1332
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,559
and so the status is that we're going

1333
00:53:58,559 --> 00:53:59,280
for

1334
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,440
adoption at the technical committee

1335
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,119
meeting with the laura alliance next

1336
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:04,480
week

1337
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,559
exactly a week from now so the deadline

1338
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,480
for submitting the document was right in

1339
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,920
the middle of this meeting and i was

1340
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,920
doing two things in parallel

1341
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,520
another one at the

1342
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,359
segment in that document at the laura

1343
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:16,880
alliance

1344
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,119
and after that

1345
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,000
the

1346
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,559
that would be the writing of the

1347
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,160
uh

1348
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,920
certification document because the lore

1349
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,400
alliance does certification which the

1350
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,200
atf doesn't do

1351
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,520
so that's an expectation before this

1352
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,880
gets

1353
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,920
in place

1354
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,040
and

1355
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,319
future work uh i'm not sure

1356
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,079
how much how

1357
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,319
far we will go into that direction but

1358
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,400
would be to investigate

1359
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,599
if lauren can be used

1360
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,240
with matter and you know the connected

1361
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,799
smart homes

1362
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:56,319
under the csa

1363
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,559
alliance

1364
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,000
and so

1365
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,640
chic would then also be used to carry

1366
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:08,240
ipv6 over r1 in that context so that's

1367
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,720
the work at the lower alliance i forgot

1368
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,880
to mention the editors of the technical

1369
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,119
specification i think it's uh

1370
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,880
important to highlight the contribution

1371
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,839
by clicking aclio

1372
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:20,400
semtech

1373
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,920
people that you know some of the archers

1374
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,880
of this working group for example

1375
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,880
and contributors by many companies and

1376
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,960
institutions and

1377
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,319
family to

1378
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:35,359
to most of you in this working group

1379
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:38,799
that's it for me thank you

1380
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:43,920
thank you thank you

1381
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,399
and

1382
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,280
so go ahead please uh

1383
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,599
you have five minutes minutes

1384
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,760
yes i will present chicago ppp

1385
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,079
[Music]

1386
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:56,799
so

1387
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,640
basically we

1388
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,640
we we discussed how we can do shake

1389
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,680
about pvp so we can do shake over

1390
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,160
the ethernet using pppoe and see if we

1391
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,000
have ethernet we have wi-fi

1392
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,240
so basically doing pvp gives us gives us

1393
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,640
all the serial links it gives us

1394
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,720
point-to-point ethernet and gives us

1395
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,599
wi-fi so that was kind of cool to do

1396
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,359
shigeru rpp but the prime was uh ppp is

1397
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,200
not part of the charter as one of the

1398
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,280
technologies that we support so we we

1399
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,960
decided to try

1400
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,400
our luck at interior so we did and the

1401
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,880
document has spent pretty much a year at

1402
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,400
that interior

1403
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,839
and i failed to get any command feedback

1404
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,640
return from from interior not much

1405
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,079
interest in check

1406
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,160
and probably not much interest muslim

1407
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,880
ppp that's this even if interior is

1408
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,440
supposed to do everything i mean this is

1409
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,880
this looks like a thing of the past

1410
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,799
almost people doesn't seem to raise a

1411
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,400
lot of interest

1412
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,280
so

1413
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,440
we discussed with um

1414
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,440
the eric and um

1415
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,480
we wondered how to to best proceed with

1416
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,880
with the future of this document

1417
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,520
and the advice is probably that that we

1418
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,839
should

1419
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:12,720
um

1420
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,760
we should

1421
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,799
try to to review it within this group

1422
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,680
and once we pass past reviews i mean

1423
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,839
eric please correct me if i'm wrong but

1424
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,599
plus we once we have passed those

1425
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,200
reviews we would ask eric for um

1426
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,720
eddie sponsored

1427
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,720
so as to to move on with this draft

1428
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,919
do you have it right eric

1429
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,920
i simply want to second what you said

1430
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:40,799
and

1431
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:43,280
that's correct so the expertise in shake

1432
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,280
is obviously in this group so

1433
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,599
why this document cannot be adopted by

1434
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,359
the working group because it doesn't fit

1435
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,680
the charter the experts are still in

1436
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,280
this working group so

1437
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,119
i count on this working group to make a

1438
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,079
review and then when you are basically

1439
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,680
done the kind of

1440
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,200
working group classical doesn't say its

1441
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,720
name because there's not a real group

1442
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,200
last call but everyone is happy with it

1443
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,680
pascal then just contact me over email

1444
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,920
and i i i will do the follow-up so

1445
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,720
basically eddie sponsored his

1446
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,240
ietf stream

1447
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,319
so it's pretty much like any uh working

1448
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,319
group rfc except that there is no group

1449
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:20,000
last call but the rest is the same right

1450
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
there's an itf white that's called isg

1451
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
evaluation and you can be a standard

1452
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,079
document

1453
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:28,240
so basically one other

1454
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,400
release pascal if everyone is happy

1455
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,799
because the knowledge is in in

1456
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:37,599
lp1 then contact me and i take over

1457
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,920
that's that's perfect so so that's

1458
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,680
pretty much where we are so yes i will

1459
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,920
post again on the mailing list asking

1460
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,960
people to review the draft i think it's

1461
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,040
it's expired or getting expired it is

1462
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:53,680
expired so uh i will republish a note 4

1463
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,720
and

1464
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,119
ask you know post to the

1465
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,720
rp1 mailing list to ask for for reviews

1466
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,480
and with this we are

1467
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,680
concluding this meeting so oh question

1468
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,480
by the way go ahead dominique

1469
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,240
yeah um

1470
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,319
just uh technical details uh there's one

1471
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:14,720
little auditing in this draft is that

1472
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,559
you put the padding between the rule id

1473
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,799
and the compression residue so i wanted

1474
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:21,760
to discuss that uh maybe we should have

1475
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,680
something in the rules themselves that

1476
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,119
tell that

1477
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:26,240
the the

1478
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,480
rule id is padded or something we can do

1479
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,880
it in a cleaner more flexible more

1480
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,200
extensible way than the way you did it

1481
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,440
so let's talk about that that's

1482
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,119
something we started to discuss with

1483
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,200
with lauren as well so yes please please

1484
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,880
