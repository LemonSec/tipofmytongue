the rfcs and links on the slides which

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,599

64
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,920
and if you have any concerns about

65
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,760
observed behaviors please talk to the

66
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,520

harassment or other conduct in the itf

70
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,879

decency and respect and that allows us

74
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,160
to do our best creative work so those

75
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,239

um this is my first participation in

170
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,919
iutf so it's a pleasure to be here

171
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,400
and hello from the west coast uh bright

172
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,360
early in uh in the morning

173
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,400
um i'm gonna be sharing our internet

174
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,759
draft for secure credential transfer

175
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,199
this is a protocol that we've designed

176
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,080
to

177
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,440
first of all highlight the problem

178
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,800
statement itself which is

179
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,720
the ability to share credentials

180
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,520
securely between devices

181
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,240
so

182
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,160
in the modern world more and more

183
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,639
credentials are being stored securely in

184
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,120
users digital wallets rather than their

185
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,840
physical badges or cards

186
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,319
some use cases do necessitate sharing of

187
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,000
these credentials from one person to

188
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,960
another so for example you may have a

189
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,319
vehicle

190
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,319
and a digital key

191
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,639
on your mobile device

192
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,120
that allows you to unlock and operate

193
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,400
that vehicle

194
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,319
and you may endeavor to share this

195
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,319
credential with

196
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,759
a family member or a friend or a valet

197
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,199
however today no secure method to share

198
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,520
these digital credentials exists

199
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,599
and moreover it doesn't exist in a

200
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,160
cross-platform and channel agnostic

201
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,800
capacity

202
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,039
so the goals for the design here

203
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,720
would be that the sharing mechanism

204
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,120
should work regardless of the type of

205
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,240
credential

206
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,560
so it could be as i mentioned earlier a

207
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,199
key to unlock and drive a vehicle

208
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,560
or it could be a key to access a hotel

209
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,800
it could be a key to access your own

210
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,879
home your single-family home or

211
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,639
multi-family home

212
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,919
there are a variety of different

213
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,280
credentials that this should work for

214
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,560
this also must work for symmetric and

215
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,280
asymmetric credentials so i'm just going

216
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,720
to spend a few seconds talking about

217
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,680
this

218
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,160
um a symmetric credential would be

219
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,400
something akin to a my fair desk fire

220
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,120
applet uh my fair desk fire is a very

221
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,080
popular technology in the access space

222
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,039
for

223
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,120
corporate offices

224
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,800
hotels

225
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,680
sometimes even transit around the world

226
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,120
and then there are

227
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,879
asymmetric

228
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,280
keys that are used one example of an

229
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,280
asymmetric key would be um

230
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,320
the iso one eight zero one six

231
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,679
specification

232
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,958
um that's an asymmetric uh credential

233
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,958
and then also digital car key

234
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,440
credentials are asymmetric as well

235
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,000
there's the ccc the um

236
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,959
uh

237
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,519
car the connected car consortium uh

238
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,080
public standards body that specifies how

239
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,320
these keys work for vehicles that the

240
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,720
vast majority of the

241
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,279
oems uh participate in

242
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,959
and that's how those keys work across

243
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,120
different types of vehicles

244
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,320
um

245
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,480
we also endeavor to have the sender

246
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,640
retained ability to manage credentials

247
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,399
that they've shared

248
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,920
so that's a very important feature here

249
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,720
if you've shared your key to your home

250
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,800
or your vehicle and you wish to revoke

251
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,240
that share you should be able to do that

252
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,320
and then we also want the ecosystem to

253
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,200
support any mobile device operating

254
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,600
system oem that adheres to the standard

255
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
being proposed here so this should work

256
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,560
between

257
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,680
devices running apple's ios platform

258
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,640
or google's android platform or any

259
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,880
other mobile operating system that

260
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,240
chooses to

261
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,399
um participate in in this standard

262
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,480
i'll also just touch really quickly um a

263
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,320
couple of folks in the email group had

264
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,160
some really great questions and i just

265
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,920
want to touch on one of them really fast

266
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,839
on this slide which is

267
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,920
um the ability to actually share these

268
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,680
credentials themselves

269
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,760
on mobile devices these credentials are

270
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,480
stored in what's called a secure element

271
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,920
um

272
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,079
the secure element is a tamper resistant

273
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,000
piece of hardware um they're almost

274
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,959
always single threaded and uh part of

275
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,640
those secure elements is that it's

276
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,839
impossible to extract a credential or or

277
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,480
uh it's you know extremely difficult to

278
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,040
extract a credential from them

279
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,959
that's part of what makes them tamper

280
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,560
resistant instead of something like a

281
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,160
physical card that can be stolen

282
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,279
the high-level solution that we've been

283
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,920
proposing in the internet draft

284
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,000
includes a new type of server called a

285
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,440
relay server

286
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,600
and the purpose of this relay server is

287
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,880
to establish quote unquote connectivity

288
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,680
between a sender and a receiver

289
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,320
and the idea is that the relay server is

290
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,040
a

291
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,680
simple mailbox and fully decoupled from

292
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,959
the credential provisioning and

293
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,240
registration

294
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,640
what i mean by that is let's pretend you

295
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,880
have a sender that currently has a

296
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,320
credential provision on his or her

297
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,600
device

298
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,519
when you share that credential the relay

299
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,760
server is acting as

300
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,000
just a pipe for some data to travel

301
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
between the sender and the receiver

302
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,320
once the receiver receives this data it

303
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,000
will likely need to contact a server

304
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,279
which is typically the credential

305
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,600
authority in order to actually provision

306
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,680
a credential in other words it's not the

307
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,839
credential itself that is sent between

308
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,160
sender and receiver it is some metadata

309
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,640
or some seed data some authorization

310
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,800
data in order for the receiver to be

311
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,240
able to procure such a credential

312
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,440
um the relay server also from a privacy

313
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,680
perspective should only receive data

314
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,720
that is field level encrypted

315
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
and then some high-level metadata for

316
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,560
the receiver to be able to

317
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,880
uh understand what it's what it has just

318
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,360
received

319
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,320
some of the design requirements here

320
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,079
include that the relay server should not

321
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,480
know the identity of the sender nor of

322
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,760
the receiver

323
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
uh so in the internet draft there are

324
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,959
some additional uh complexity listed

325
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:05,760
for

326
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,480
having anonymous attestations to

327
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,880
authenticate the sender um that don't

328
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,920
disclose the identity of the sender

329
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,760
this relay server also shall not

330
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,399
interface with any other server it's

331
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,120
purely used for transport between sender

332
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,360
and recipient and in some cases vice

333
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,320
versa back from recipient to sender

334
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,399
as i mentioned all of the sensitive data

335
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,160
over the relay server is field level

336
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,279
encrypted

337
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,120
ensuring that the relay server cannot

338
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,839
see what is being shared

339
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,440
and the sharing should be able to be

340
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,839
initiated or

341
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,760
occur for in any communication channel

342
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,240
this could be email this could be sms or

343
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,560
imessage or a whatsapp application

344
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,959
this is a high-level diagram that i'll

345
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,959
spend a few minutes walking through just

346
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,800
to have a visual

347
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,279
of the flow that i've discussed

348
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,200
i'll start by describing all of the

349
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,240
actors that are in the white boxes and

350
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,040
then i'll talk about the flow itself

351
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,880
so in the lower left of your screen

352
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,959
that's the sending device that's the

353
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,600
device that uh ostensibly already has a

354
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,240
credential provisioned on it uh that

355
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,560
wants to share to the the box in the

356
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,680
lower right that is the receiving device

357
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
in the bottom middle there is the

358
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,920
communication channel itself this could

359
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,279
be whatsapp sms email or anything else

360
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,040
in the middle of your screen is the

361
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,079
relay server that is this new actor in

362
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,600
the ecosystem that that we've been

363
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,680
proposing transport the data between

364
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
sender and receiver uh there are a

365
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,279
number of reasons for the relay server

366
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,199
i'm hoping we can get into some q a

367
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,880
after the uh slides and talk about it um

368
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,040
the metadata required to provision these

369
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,440
credentials is oftentimes fairly large

370
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,160
maybe 500 bytes or a kilobyte and that

371
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,920
data obviously can't travel in a single

372
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,560
sms message um it would also be very

373
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,959
confusing to the user if they saw

374
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,720
you know binary data that was encoded in

375
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,360
hex or base64 traveling in their actual

376
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,240
message channel so by sending a url in

377
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,399
number three that points to the data you

378
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,000
can have a much better

379
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,880
uh experience for the receiver

380
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,480
with the data actually being procured

381
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,279
from the relay server

382
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,600
in the upper left of your screen device

383
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,240
operating system manufacturer server and

384
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
then same thing on the upper right this

385
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,519
would be

386
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,440
a server that's owned and operated by

387
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,000
apple if the sender was an iphone or an

388
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,880
apple watch or by google if the sender

389
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,279
was an android device uh and then vice

390
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,800
versa for the receiver

391
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,639
so it's basically the operating system

392
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,480
on the mobile device

393
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,560
whichever company uh builds that

394
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,399
operating system and operates it would

395
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,399
be that server that you see there

396
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,519
um

397
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,279
in the middle top of your screen

398
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,040
credential authority

399
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,760
so

400
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,959
when you look at these types of

401
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,320
credentials

402
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,920
there's almost always a remote

403
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,800
credential authority that is issuing

404
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,160
these credentials

405
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,040
and

406
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,040
this credential authority typically is

407
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,360
the only entity that can issue them

408
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,760
so for example if you were

409
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,519
sharing a hotel key uh that credential

410
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,440
authority would be you know for example

411
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,720
the hyatt company as one example

412
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,240
i mentioned earlier why you can't just

413
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,839
send a credential from the sender to the

414
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,320
receiver you also can't duplicate it you

415
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
can't clone them these are all security

416
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,120
primitives of the secure element on the

417
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,560
sending device

418
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,000
the credential authority would be the

419
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,480
only entity that can issue a credential

420
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,040
so the basic flow starting in the lower

421
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,079
left and going up with number one the

422
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,160
sending device is effectively

423
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,000
reaching out to the credential authority

424
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,480
through the oem server

425
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,519
and obtaining effectively a bearer token

426
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,279
um authenticating to the credential

427
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,399
authority

428
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,320
as the sender that already has a current

429
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,079
provision credential

430
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,240
that credential authority will mint a

431
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,639
new bearer token and store it and send

432
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,560
it back down to the sender

433
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,560
um and then the sender is going to be

434
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,440
wrapping this data up um sending the

435
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,759
data to the relay server

436
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,480
the relay server will generate a url for

437
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,680
the relay server itself the uri will be

438
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,519
highly defined in the specification the

439
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,000
url could be whatever the relay server

440
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,279
wants to

441
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,120
that might give spatial locality for

442
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,639
bandwidth depending on where you know

443
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,519
folks are in the world or

444
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,040
load balancing you know if you want to

445
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
have different shards

446
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,959
and then the sender will send this url

447
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,199
over the communication channel down at

448
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,680
the bottom here to the receiver

449
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
the receiver will download the data from

450
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,040
the relay server

451
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,600
and uh provision or register this

452
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,839
credential against their own device os

453
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:50,800
oem

454
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,079
that then goes to the credential

455
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,160
authority exchanging the bearer token

456
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,959
for

457
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,959
a newly minted credential

458
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,240
um

459
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,160
it's also worth noting we were thinking

460
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,839
of using open graph as a data structure

461
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:04,799
for

462
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,679
the contents of the link when an http

463
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,640
get is called on the relay server open

464
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,559
graph is a very popular standard as i'm

465
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,240
sure a lot of folks on this call would

466
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,959
be

467
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,839
aware that allows for rich preview

468
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,599
it's very prevalent on messaging

469
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,599
applications

470
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,919
on social media sites

471
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,919
especially when you share for example if

472
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,440
you find a restaurant on yelp or

473
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,880
some other type of website when you

474
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,799
share that with somebody else

475
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,559
there's typically an open graph preview

476
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,000
that's rendered

477
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,080
with an image and some text and that way

478
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,480
the link looks nice on the receiver's

479
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,600
device

480
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,000
we do intend to make use of that to show

481
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,280
what the sender is sharing with the

482
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,600
receiver

483
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,960
um

484
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,679
i think i think with that that's the

485
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,440
the basic presentation that i wanted to

486
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,760
describe for how it works i know kirsty

487
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,200
mentioned that we do have a little bit

488
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,360
of extra time today which is great

489
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,440
um i know there were some questions over

490
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,600
the email group from eric and from

491
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,640
others i'd be happy to answer those or

492
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,559
um if we wanted to take some questions

493
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,960
from folks in the chat um again this is

494
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,520
my first participation in itf so i'm not

495
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,679
sure what the best place to take q a

496
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,280
from but i would i would be happy to

497
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,720
answer some questions

498
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,880
hey matt this is patrick um i'm

499
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,640
christie's co-chair here going to help

500
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,160
run the queue during this part of the

501
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,200
discussion so um great i wanted to start

502
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,120
by thanking you for bringing this to the

503
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,000
ietf um i really appreciate it there are

504
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,240
a few very interesting elements here and

505
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,320
we'll see um whether or not folks think

506
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,559
this is an appropriate ietf work item or

507
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,520
not um but either way i do appreciate

508
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,360
you bringing it in

509
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,919
a reminder to our group because it is

510
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,440
the first meeting of the week the goal

511
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,400
here

512
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
is to figure out the right home for the

513
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,160
work we're talking about

514
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,200
not to

515
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
resolve any or all

516
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
issues identify all issues and resolve

517
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,559
them here during the meeting but to

518
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,000
figure out what the right group of

519
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,960
people the right form it is um to work

520
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,760
on

521
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,840
so matt i do have one question for you

522
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,679
before and feel free i see pete's in the

523
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,480
queue feel free to join the queue we do

524
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,160
as matt said have a little more time

525
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,600
than usual um with a light agenda so uh

526
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,280
we won't be too strict on staying into

527
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,640
our time window so we can do some

528
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,080
discussion of what's in the draft as

529
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,320
well as its outcome if it's helpful in

530
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,400
figuring out the outcome so matt i do

531
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,240
have one question before we get started

532
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,720
um just what is the sort of state of the

533
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
technology described by this draft is

534
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,080
this um conceptual and all change

535
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,000
control will live with the iatf if the

536
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,320
iatf chooses to adopt this work is this

537
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,679
something that's already been deployed

538
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,919
and there's some constraints around that

539
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,200
that kind of thing if you could kind of

540
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,160
give us some flavor i'd appreciate it

541
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,799
yeah absolutely patrick um

542
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,960
i would say it's somewhere in between we

543
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,440
have there have been meetings

544
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,559
um

545
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,240
uh between some companies um

546
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,880
around this topic so far so one of the

547
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,039
topics here has been

548
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,280
this is a cross-platform sharing

549
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,559
mechanism

550
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,360
that

551
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,320
would

552
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,280
need to be adopted by for example the

553
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,600
vehicle oems and so

554
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,120
we have been having some preliminary

555
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,720
discussions with

556
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,200
both the device os oems as i mentioned

557
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,320
before so that would be google and apple

558
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,360
um and and others and then also the

559
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,240
vehicle oems because there is currently

560
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,960
a

561
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,360
sharing protocol defined in the ccc

562
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,880
standard

563
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,400
that we are um actually uh proposing to

564
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,799
um remove and reference the ietf

565
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,880
standard for a more global and

566
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,159
cross-platform and open channel solution

567
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,000
so we have had some discussions with the

568
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,880
ccc body as well um

569
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,679
and so there's no there's no

570
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,640
the feature is not launched yet um but

571
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,840
we do

572
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,480
have plans to build something

573
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,880
uh like this and we will um you know

574
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,320
obviously would love to take feedback

575
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,480
and and make the solution better from

576
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
the ietf group but there are concrete

577
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,600
plans to

578
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,360
implement a solution that satisfies the

579
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,799
goals described in this in this

580
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,200
presentation

581
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,360
okay thank you for that uh would you

582
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,559
like me to open up the queue or would

583
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,000
you like to address uh any of the

584
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,200
comments from the mailing list first

585
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,679
i'll leave that up to you

586
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:22,640
um

587
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,320
i think

588
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,360
eric uh roscorla hopefully i did not

589
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,760
butcher your last name had a number of

590
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,440
great questions maybe i can touch on

591
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,320
those

592
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,640
really quickly and yeah

593
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,320
he is in the queue as well um i thought

594
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,520
you might want to address ted's comments

595
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,840
i know ted cannot make the meeting

596
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,080
yeah i would love to i was unable to

597
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,559
find ted's comments is there any way

598
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,039
that you have them or

599
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,960
um

600
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,559
all right i look into that they may have

601
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,159
just been sent to the chairs i'm not

602
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,919
confident so i will read those back in a

603
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,600
few minutes for us but when we open you

604
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,679
now for the sake of time uh pete you're

605
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,840
first

606
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,440
pete can you hear us

607
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,559
all right philip why don't you jump over

608
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,679
repeat in the queue and we'll come back

609
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,000
to pete

610
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,840
okay yeah um

611
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,520
why not use saml

612
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,679
i mean like it exists as a standard it

613
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,360
was designed to do exactly this

614
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,440
um

615
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,280
i i may not be familiar with that can

616
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,320
you describe it a little bit

617
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,640
uh

618
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,720
it's an oasis standard it's um

619
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,360
it has its origins in

620
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,480
uh

621
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,159
peaks

622
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,640
uh basically started off with the

623
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,520
rationalization of the pkix architecture

624
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,039
uh put into xml

625
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,159
so it has a an assertion format

626
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,320
that's extremely flexible

627
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,000
and its application was to

628
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,240
authentication and authorization

629
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,400
and it is widely used in enterprises

630
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,080
including apple and google

631
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,559
it's the way that uh pretty much every

632
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,120
piece of enterprise software will talk

633
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,440
to and pretty much every other piece of

634
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,120
enterprise software

635
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,679
under the covers where a needs to

636
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,760
authenticate to be

637
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,559
there is a binding to

638
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,600
html and the web of course

639
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,480
but

640
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,840
you don't have to do that you can do

641
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,559
it um

642
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,559
you can't do it without

643
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,360
i've not been involved in that uh world

644
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,960
for

645
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,039
well over a decade

646
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,559
but uh it it does exist it is widely

647
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,760
supported

648
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,200
it's all existing code

649
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
i see i i think

650
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,919
at least in my opinion the

651
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,400
the format of the messages in two and

652
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,279
four

653
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,360
the contents of them

654
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,919
and and even how authentication works

655
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,120
you know is not i think i think those

656
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,120
could vary and we could debate that

657
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,600
absolutely i think the the main

658
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,159
architectural piece that i'm trying to

659
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,200
um

660
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,360
highlight that i think there's a gap for

661
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
is that the messages can't be sent

662
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,919
directly from the sender to the receiver

663
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,760
the credential itself cannot be

664
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,279
extracted from the sender and sent to

665
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,120
the receiver and we need some kind of a

666
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,080
of a server that relays messages to and

667
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,559
from the sender and receiver to get

668
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,320
around certain communication channel

669
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,200
restrictions and so i'm i i would be

670
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,039
open to researching different formats of

671
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,919
messages in two and four um

672
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,559
uh absolutely but but i i think the main

673
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,960
architectural piece here is the presence

674
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,240
of the relay server and how the

675
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,000
how the sender and the receiver use it

676
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,279
if that if that makes any sense

677
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,240
are you doing it in jason but uh

678
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,760
i i would look at

679
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,360
the uh assertion format it was designed

680
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,480
to be a completely uh

681
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,039
flexible system originally it may have

682
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,120
been it may have ossified into a

683
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,559
particular

684
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,200
uh niche but that was the goal but

685
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,480
anyway

686
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,919
okay

687
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,760
understood i will make a note and look

688
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,158
into that

689
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,799
sam you're up

690
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,600
matt thanks for bringing to us um this

691
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,520
looks like a set of problems that i've

692
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,840
been thinking about in the context of

693
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,440
web then

694
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,240
um which i've characterized as selective

695
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,480
permissionless delegation

696
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,640
and i posted that the solution to it

697
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,919
will also

698
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,600
potentially

699
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,840
address the device

700
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,000
recovery loss and migration problems

701
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,159
that said when i look at what you're

702
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,559
describing here i i don't see a way that

703
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,880
it works with hardware-backed

704
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,600
crypto stores like a a yuba key some

705
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,279
other hardware token

706
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,480
where you

707
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,320
don't then drill a back door into it to

708
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,200
get the crypto key out

709
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,080
i'm not hearing you describe

710
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,840
that this is permissionless i'm hearing

711
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,720
you say

712
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,880
in the case of the auto folks that you

713
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,520
need the auto oem to

714
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,120
get involved

715
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
um and i wish i were hearing that as a

716
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,880
requirement

717
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,360
and i'm also not sure i'm hearing an

718
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,159
answer here for revocation i i've used

719
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,960
the word or the require this word um

720
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,200
selective delegation

721
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,120
um i think we've been talking a little

722
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,039
bit here about revocation but i don't

723
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,320
see that answer

724
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,440
so

725
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,720
well i think there's some there are

726
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,320
interesting problems here i would love

727
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,840
to see progress

728
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,240
i'm not convinced that

729
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,880
we actually have that you here have the

730
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,880
problem statement worked out

731
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,600
never mind a good solution for it

732
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,720
so

733
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,880
maybe the best suggestion is a buff to

734
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,200
work on the requirements

735
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,120
um

736
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,880
and i'll turn it back over for responses

737
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,720
or to stephen

738
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,240
i appreciate the right answer to the

739
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,039
dispatch question

740
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,360
even

741
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,880
uh yeah so so i guess kind of like sam i

742
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,640
think there's an interesting area i

743
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,799
don't think the internet draft

744
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,480
particularly or the presentation

745
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,240
indicates that it's yeah the problem

746
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,159
statement is fully worked out yet

747
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,840
and it sounds like this would get very

748
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,520
complicated particularly with managing

749
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
credentials after you've shared them or

750
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,840
or or transferred them

751
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,799
so

752
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,399
i'm not first if it would turn into a

753
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,960
buff uh but i do think that there would

754
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,720
be need you know if this goes forward

755
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,919
and i would like to see it go forward

756
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,240
there should be work on the requirements

757
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,440
um i'd also be one other thing is

758
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,520
i would hope we don't start working on

759
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,360
things that assume

760
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,760
there needs to be

761
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,960
there absolutely needs to be an

762
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,320
operating system overlords like an

763
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,919
android or a ios involved in the game

764
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,679
for it to work at all it should work on

765
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,480
the internet without those kind of

766
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,799
setups

767
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,480
got it thank you so much sam and steven

768
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,080
i i might just take a quick minute to

769
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,760
respond to a couple of those things um

770
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,000
on the revocation story

771
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,760
when you think about revocation with

772
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,200
something like this

773
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
once the receiver has provisioned a

774
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,559
credential

775
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,399
you have to imagine that that relay

776
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,200
server and the communication channel no

777
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,679
longer exist right because the sender

778
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,080
only has the ability to send messages to

779
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,240
the receiver over text or email or

780
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,399
whatever the communication channel was

781
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,320
and they could be totally different

782
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,919
operating systems the sender could be on

783
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,720
ios and the receiver could be on android

784
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,840
and so

785
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,360
from a revocation

786
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,600
perspective all of that will be

787
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,039
happening through the credential

788
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,279
authority itself so the credential

789
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,799
authority

790
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,760
knows

791
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,200
both of these credentials that were

792
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
issued to the sender and the receiver

793
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,720
the credential authority is the

794
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,279
authority of those credentials and it

795
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,600
understands the link between them

796
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,360
uh given that the sender shared with the

797
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,480
receiver

798
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,520
and so

799
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,080
basically the idea for revocation is

800
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,320
that if the sender desires to revoke the

801
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,399
credential it would send a message to

802
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,000
the credential authority asking to

803
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,640
revoke a specific share or send

804
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,559
and from that share identifier or send

805
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,399
identifier the credential authority

806
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,159
would both be able to look up the

807
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,399
receiver's credential and be able to

808
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,039
perform authentication on the sender to

809
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,880
see if the sender was the entity that

810
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,240
shared with the receiver in the first

811
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,039
place

812
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,279
in that case the credential authority

813
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,760
essentially has to keep a graph

814
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,039
of of shares on its side and

815
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,200
all the revocation the authentication

816
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,039
for it needs to be performed by the

817
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,640
credential authority which is the only

818
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,039
authority that really bridges the gap

819
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,600
between the sender and the receiver

820
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,960
um

821
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,360
and and so that was kind of my

822
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,399
answer i think mostly to sam's question

823
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,159
um

824
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,080
but these are all great comments i'm

825
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,000
also taking notes here on my side

826
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,720
thanks matt

827
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,120
ecker

828
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,279
thanks for thanks for the talk um so i

829
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,640
think you know let me start with the

830
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,159
dispatch questions which is i think that

831
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,840
like as other people were saying i think

832
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,279
it's pretty hard to reverse engineer the

833
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,600
requirements out of this um document so

834
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,559
that's the place to start is the

835
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,000
requirements and then we can talk about

836
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,399
what you know what the design um there

837
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,360
seem to be a bunch of important

838
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,320
requirements they're driving this design

839
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,919
that i'm having trouble like sort of

840
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,080
understanding how you got here um

841
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,799
uh so in particular like i guess given

842
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,880
that you have to um you know

843
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,399
i heard this point repeatedly about how

844
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,640
big sms messages are um but given that

845
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,080
what you're actually doing is giving a

846
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,600
token which is then used to redeem at

847
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,360
the device oem server via the credential

848
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,799
authority i'm not sure why this can't be

849
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,480
small um

850
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,440
uh

851
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,279
i think you know generally like what i

852
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,159
notice about this is you seem to be

853
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,919
solving the easy problem which is once

854
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,120
you've established a secure channel how

855
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,799
do i get data across it but the problem

856
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,159
with this the difficult problem is how

857
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,880
to establish a secure channel um and so

858
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,399
i think you know first to sort of assume

859
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,840
like sms is like totally secure seems

860
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,279
like kind of like not a great a great

861
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,120
place to start um

862
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,480
but any case um i think certainly be

863
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,440
interesting to talk about working on

864
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,799
this but i think the place to start is

865
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,000
um you know with a pretty clear

866
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,559
statement of the requirements case um

867
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,080
and then we can talk about the design

868
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,600
space which may be larger than you have

869
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,519
got it that makes sense eric thank you

870
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,720
and thank you so much for your comments

871
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,960
and email um those were great as well

872
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,360
i think i think the on the requirements

873
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,519
i uh sounds good i hear you i will try

874
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,679
to document them further

875
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,760
um on the small token

876
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,120
the

877
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,399
the bearer token that's obtained from

878
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,240
the credential authority

879
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,559
needs to be somewhat polymorphic or at

880
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,720
least be allowed to be for example you

881
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,080
might have a credential authority that

882
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,399
doesn't want to store the token in

883
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,720
non-volatile storage and thus might need

884
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,640
to have a digital signature applied to

885
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,559
it that they could verify themselves

886
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,399
when the receiver gives it back to them

887
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,559
things like that and so i think the size

888
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,080
of that token

889
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,799
will be relatively small but maybe you

890
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,320
know maybe up to a kilobyte or two

891
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,480
depending on what key was used to sign

892
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,640
it um or if if they want to store it

893
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,919
then of course it could probably just be

894
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,720
a uuid and they don't need to sign it um

895
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,559
i think

896
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,640
i think in general the experience for

897
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,760
the receiver is important

898
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,840
and if you are a

899
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,720
receiver receiving an imessage or an sms

900
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,919
or an email

901
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,440
you you probably don't want to see a

902
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,320
bunch of bits and bytes in there and and

903
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,840
that token needs to have a number of

904
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,440
things in it

905
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,720
also

906
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,559
notably it needs to have information

907
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,600
required for any device os oem to

908
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,200
provision this and so you might have

909
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,960
apple specific data or google specific

910
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,720
data you'd all of them would need to be

911
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,080
present

912
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,840
to invoke the right api in number five

913
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,279
to actually provision that credential

914
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,320
number five is not standardized um

915
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,919
and then lastly on your comments on

916
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,080
secure channel totally agree sms is

917
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,240
obviously not a secure channel i think

918
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,320
in general in this cross-platform

919
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,519
cross-channel solution we've effectively

920
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,240
deemed recipient binding

921
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,120
a non-goal and effectively an impossible

922
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,640
problem you would need

923
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,240
you know global directory system with

924
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,840
all different kinds of channels in it

925
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,760
mapping to public keys so you could do

926
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,679
field level encryption to them and that

927
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,519
just doesn't exist in a cross-platform

928
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,600
cross-channel capacity today

929
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,480
um

930
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,320
i think we we do have a number of

931
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,640
security mitigations that that we've

932
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,600
thought through in terms of a low ttl on

933
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,120
the relay server for this particular

934
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,919
share

935
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,039
uh device binding in number four the

936
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,399
idea being a receiver sends a uuid up in

937
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,840
number four when it first obtains the

938
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,359
data and that kind of binds that

939
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,079
receiver to that relay server the main

940
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,679
security mechanism is the entropy of the

941
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,359
url itself the url will contain 128

942
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,040
um uuid

943
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,440
and it's sent over this channel um the

944
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,239
channel itself may be insecure but uh

945
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,879
the receiver will be bound to the relay

946
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,119
once it first invokes that relay upon

947
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,040
receipt of the message

948
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,359
and the url itself will be very

949
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,960
challenging to guess because of the

950
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,960
entropy inside of it those were some of

951
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,040
the security primitives that we

952
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,719
had thought of although

953
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,639
i totally agree that is one of the weak

954
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,480
security points of this

955
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,239
design is the communication channel

956
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,079
itself

957
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,560
i mean yeah it means i mean

958
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,599
i guess i don't really want to try to

959
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,560
break down the design um um so i guess

960
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,760
um you know

961
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,720
um

962
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,880
uh

963
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,480
you know like all those things depend on

964
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,440
the channel right the channel isn't

965
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,440
secure then this game over so um

966
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,839
um like in any case i think i i get uh

967
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,760
um so i guess i would make two points um

968
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,880
as i said first of all i think it'd be

969
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,839
really helpful to like a lot of

970
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,200
requirements um i don't mean by the way

971
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,880
a document with like a list of like you

972
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,960
know r1 r2 r3 what i mean is a

973
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,079
description of the setting and

974
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,280
description of the things that you think

975
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,720
um are kind of the constraints to

976
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,000
operate with and then we can debate with

977
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,920
those constraints are important or not

978
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,040
um so um i guess with that said um

979
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,440
like um i am pretty sad about this

980
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,440
session that what has to happen here is

981
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,680
that the sender has to generate a thing

982
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,280
which is acceptable for like every

983
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,520
possible kind of receiver um that seems

984
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,720
like the point of standards does not

985
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,079
have to do that and that seems to have

986
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,480
an incredible set of lock in to the

987
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,640
incumbent on device manufacturers um

988
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,000
which is the point steve i think stephen

989
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,079
farrell was racing so um like i think if

990
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,119
we're going to do this what ought to

991
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,320
happen is there's one message format

992
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,520
which you send and that message is

993
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,960
important actually process by everybody

994
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,640
and they have to change not that we have

995
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,760
like some sort of thing where it's like

996
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,960
i have to i have the standard thing for

997
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,240
android and ios and whatever because

998
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,599
that means if i roll a new operating

999
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,560
system basically i'm host

1000
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,920
thanks all those yeah that was a good

1001
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,520
discussion thank you

1002
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,359
i'm going to move on to richard next i

1003
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,200
just wanted to give folks the heads up

1004
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,440
that i'm gonna hit this powerful lock q

1005
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,839
button i got in front of me um in a few

1006
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,440
seconds so if you'd like to get into the

1007
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,599
queue uh now's the time to virtually

1008
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,320
stretch your legs and get over there

1009
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,800
um but uh so uh richard barnes i'm sorry

1010
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,839
rich

1011
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,359
richard brunson's next in the queue

1012
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,320
you're on the list though

1013
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
thanks patrick um so just to hit the

1014
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,800
dispatch question first um i think this

1015
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,200
is probably about the right size of work

1016
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,359
for a small working group it's i think

1017
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,520
it does mirror the working group as

1018
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,880
opposed to going somewhere else just

1019
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,960
because it's a fairly discreet subject

1020
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,320
area and a non-trivial amount of work um

1021
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,720
i i don't think as

1022
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,560
well as several other folks who said i

1023
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,119
don't think that the clarity is is quite

1024
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,880
here yet with regard to what this group

1025
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,119
will be doing uh and what problem it

1026
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,400
would be solving so i think we need

1027
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,040
another iteration on that um but this

1028
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,800
seems i think there's probably a

1029
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,880
worthwhile thing to work on here

1030
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,760
um

1031
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,920
that's kind of where my my substantive

1032
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,079
comments are it's like i

1033
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,920
i i'm a little confused on a couple

1034
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,320
points the trust like this this question

1035
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,839
of um trust establishment has been

1036
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,160
raised a couple of times i think is i

1037
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,880
was a little troubled um by these

1038
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,480
assertions just now that the the

1039
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,040
communication channel um is we basically

1040
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
assumed to be insecure because

1041
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,280
um you know if if there's no security at

1042
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,680
the bottom uh zekker noted like there's

1043
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,960
there's no security in the rest of the

1044
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,880
system either and so basically all we're

1045
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,800
just doing is inventing a fancy uh

1046
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,320
compression scheme

1047
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,640
um so i think we need to be super crisp

1048
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,119
on on what the uh you know what we

1049
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,560
assume about that communication channel

1050
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,079
what we assume about the relationship

1051
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,800
between the sender and the receiver is

1052
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,359
i think there are probably some options

1053
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,880
here in terms of things that have a

1054
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,800
reasonable user experience

1055
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,880
and uh do achieve security on that

1056
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,240
communications channel but it will

1057
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,240
require a little bit of thinking about

1058
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
how to align

1059
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,040
the use case with the the security

1060
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,880
technologies we have available

1061
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,000
um

1062
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,119
a quick question um i'm a little bit

1063
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,000
curious why this is this mechanism is

1064
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,160
focused on credentials

1065
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,480
it seems like this could be framed as a

1066
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,280
general mechanism for syncing uh private

1067
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,240
data across different instances uh

1068
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,400
within a security within a particular

1069
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,240
security boundary um so i'm a little

1070
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,760
curious why this isn't a general sync

1071
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,599
protocol why it's quite

1072
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,520
specifically focused on um on

1073
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,960
credentials

1074
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,200
and finally the last point i had which

1075
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,079
i think

1076
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,000
well i think rich was going to cover

1077
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,200
pizza along i'll put that off

1078
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,839
so yeah that's what i got

1079
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:47,280
things got it thank you very much

1080
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,480
richard um i i fully concur with your

1081
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,920
last statement there this this really

1082
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,079
could be generic um

1083
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,359
i don't think it would be a great

1084
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,240
mechanism per se for sync in terms of

1085
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,440
ongoing persistent synchronizing of data

1086
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,680
between sender and receiver

1087
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,440
typically in those scenarios you want a

1088
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,040
much

1089
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,200
at least in my opinion you want a much

1090
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,400
more

1091
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,480
well-defined authentication

1092
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,400
authorization story between sender and

1093
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,480
receiver and who can sync and who can

1094
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,400
push in this case it's kind of like a

1095
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,200
one-shot send where you kind of lob this

1096
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,520
thing over the fence to the receiver

1097
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,359
that they can then kind of go provision

1098
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,200
and it's i mean obviously you know a

1099
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,800
bearer token the idea is that whoever

1100
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,119
has possession of the bearer token

1101
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,720
has the permission and authority to go

1102
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,520
off and use it and so i think i think

1103
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,200
you're right that it's it's much more

1104
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,520
generic than just credentials but i

1105
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,800
don't think it should be used for like a

1106
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,200
persistent sync mechanism that's like an

1107
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,400
ongoing

1108
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,280
you know you know sync of data um

1109
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,280
totally hear you on the lack of clarity

1110
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,480
i think that's been mentioned a few

1111
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,720
times i will work on putting together a

1112
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,560
better kind of user story and

1113
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,720
requirements um

1114
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,880
documentation

1115
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,960
for that

1116
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,280
if i may like as you're thinking through

1117
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,280
those requirements i would think um i

1118
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,640
would focus a lot on kind of the

1119
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,359
security assumptions here um who knows

1120
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,359
what about whom um

1121
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,720
with confidence um and things like that

1122
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,400
who is trusted to do what i think you've

1123
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,079
captured some of that with uh talking

1124
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,520
about what the relay server is trusted

1125
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,119
to do and not to but i think

1126
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,319
highlighting those kind of security

1127
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,480
assumptions would be really useful

1128
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,240
yeah the problem statement we started

1129
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,520
with was really

1130
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,000
um you know if you imagine

1131
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,520
sharing a photo

1132
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,680
let's say you you snap a photo on your

1133
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,800
phone

1134
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,400
um you you know typically device oem

1135
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,079
um

1136
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,319
you can click a share button somewhere

1137
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,400
and it you know it kind of says hey you

1138
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,440
know how do you want to share this you

1139
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,599
want to share it over email or sms or

1140
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,000
you know apple has um airdrop

1141
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,599
you know those kind of things the idea

1142
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,079
was something very very similar to that

1143
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,839
making it as easy as possible and as

1144
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,920
seamless as possible to share a

1145
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,400
credential like a hotel key with a loved

1146
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,119
one or a family member uh just as if you

1147
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,760
were sharing a photo and um you know

1148
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,680
wanting it to work cross-platform that

1149
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,119
that's kind of the problem statement

1150
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,880
that we really started with

1151
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,839
um

1152
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,520
and with the sender being able to revoke

1153
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,359
and view who they shared to and all

1154
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,079
those kind of things and the short ttl

1155
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,319
single you know single redemption

1156
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,160
we didn't think that the security

1157
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,000
channel it's uh excuse me the

1158
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,920
communication channel itself

1159
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,560
needed to be all that secure because

1160
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,400
if it's compromised you can just revoke

1161
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,760
the credential and share it in some

1162
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,960
other way

1163
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,520
but but i will save some of these

1164
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,599
comments and responses for whenever we

1165
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,119
establish the appropriate working group

1166
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,359
cool

1167
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,359
colin

1168
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,520
so uh

1169
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,640
two different points i want to talk

1170
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,640
about uh one one with spam and one was

1171
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,400
just what we need to standardize here

1172
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,240
and but let me just start by saying

1173
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,680
thank you for bringing this i really

1174
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,280
like uh just the way you've been dealing

1175
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,880
with all this i know how frustrating it

1176
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,800
can be to deal with getting a new group

1177
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,880
of people up to speed with what's no

1178
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,560
doubt years of thinking going into this

1179
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,160
so um

1180
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,680
bear with us and help us get to the

1181
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,480
thing

1182
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,560
so with that said let me jump into the

1183
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,960
the big picture here um i'm in i mean

1184
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,800
like we have this problem with how to

1185
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,319
standardize and move things um we

1186
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,520
actually need to move credentials

1187
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,520
between devices and video conferencing

1188
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,119
things and stuff i wear my employer i

1189
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,640
mean we use ultrasound for the

1190
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,839
communications

1191
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,680
channel that you have there which is

1192
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,640
even lower bitrate than sms i mean i i'm

1193
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,640
really strongly in favor of solving this

1194
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,480
problem but the problem is not

1195
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,000
standardizing the relay server the

1196
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,680
problem is standardizing this whole

1197
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,680
slide that you have the slide six i feel

1198
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,520
very strongly we need to figure and that

1199
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,960
doesn't mean that every one of these

1200
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,560
standards can be done by itf or whatever

1201
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,560
it is just but we need an overall

1202
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,119
solution to the the big problem of of

1203
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,560
your title right which is how to

1204
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,720
transfer credentials from

1205
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,880
sender to receiver i'm strongly in favor

1206
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,880
of that but if all we need was the relay

1207
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,560
server here i mean there's many things

1208
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,079
we could use i mean there's many iot

1209
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,440
messaging but i mean there's a ton of

1210
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,760
technologies that existed over time that

1211
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,400
allow us to effectively expand out a

1212
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,800
link to some larger data and do what the

1213
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,640
relay server thing is here that's not

1214
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,000
that's not the problem you're really

1215
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
solving so i think when you think about

1216
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,319
the requirements and the solution

1217
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,800
i'd i'd really ask for us to talk about

1218
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,960
the whole problem here not a teeny part

1219
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,960
of it so i want to you know standardize

1220
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,880
you know the syringe that moves the

1221
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,720
drugs around and the drugs here such

1222
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,480
that we have an interoperable solution i

1223
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,240
mean what we need to be able to say at

1224
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,839
the end of this is

1225
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,599
you know if two different devices both

1226
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,359
implemented this they would be able to

1227
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,160
securely exchange credentials not well

1228
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,760
they could both talk to the same relay

1229
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,599
server but they're all the hard parts

1230
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,960
are ignored right let's not ignore the

1231
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,359
hard parts let's do the whole thing

1232
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,599
um i mean does that is is that a

1233
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:50,880
reasonable scope you're willing to deal

1234
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,000
with sort of hitting this whole thing

1235
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,839
thank you so much colin i think i think

1236
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,160
i really appreciate your comments um and

1237
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,599
questions i think you're i think you're

1238
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:00,720
spot on

1239
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,800
the part of the the challenge here is

1240
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,359
that when you look at the major uh

1241
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,520
device os oems

1242
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,359
like apple and google

1243
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,200
they they have

1244
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,440
existing provisioning

1245
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,319
apis and rails to get secure credentials

1246
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,960
into mobile devices for years now

1247
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,119
um and if you look at you know credit

1248
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,599
and debit cards and transit and and

1249
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,960
um you know car keys these things exist

1250
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,800
in production today

1251
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,880
and part of the complexity here i think

1252
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,599
is

1253
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:32,880
um

1254
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,880
the way that apple does it in the apis

1255
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,359
are completely proprietary to apple and

1256
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,359
the way that google does it and the apis

1257
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,280
are completely proprietary to google and

1258
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,800
so on and so forth for you know for

1259
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,160
different device os oems and so

1260
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,760
building a system that allows you to

1261
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,000
exchange these credentials and

1262
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,920
standardize those vertical legs there

1263
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,240
right number one and number five to your

1264
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,440
point would be fully ideal and be a much

1265
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,359
more comprehensive all-encompassing

1266
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:00,960
solution

1267
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,680
but the background compatibility story

1268
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,440
and the level of effort required to

1269
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,880
standardize these apis would be

1270
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,440
absolutely monumental on the order of

1271
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,800
yeah this whole solution you're

1272
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,640
describing is useless without that so

1273
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,240
you're saying you're going to take that

1274
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,800
on anyway now i'm not arguing for in the

1275
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,400
slightest that there's only one way to

1276
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,839
do one or five

1277
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,319
and we have to be anytime we define

1278
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,760
something like this we have to take into

1279
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,160
account the reality of what exists there

1280
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,839
but i'm saying that we

1281
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,560
we define some of those and that that

1282
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,640
yes car manufacturers and hotels and

1283
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,240
others will

1284
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,760
we will try and design them in such a

1285
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,200
way that that is

1286
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,200
that meets the that is close to what

1287
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,119
they have today or ideally they can use

1288
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,119
exactly what they have today but that we

1289
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,319
need to take that into account of the

1290
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,760
design of the whole system and we're

1291
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,119
gonna we're gonna pick some that win and

1292
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,319
some that lose it's not like we're gonna

1293
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:49,920
be able to support everything forever

1294
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,640
right

1295
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,400
um but yeah that's exactly what i'm

1296
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,400
proposing and and i think that the the

1297
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,200
meta point here is that this the

1298
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,040
standardizing the relay server without

1299
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,640
something functionally that works at one

1300
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,119
and five is useless anyway

1301
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,160
i think

1302
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,319
total and fair points oh uh go ahead

1303
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,079
no i was gonna say uh i mean you always

1304
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,160
have good insight into the dispatch

1305
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,640
outcomes all right are you suggesting

1306
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,319
that this is perhaps like requirements

1307
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,160
that would come back and you know be an

1308
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,960
excellent ietf wide buff i think um

1309
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,400
christian are sort of talking about that

1310
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,400
as maybe the sentiment we're hearing

1311
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,920
across the room

1312
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,880
i mean

1313
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,240
look you know i've seen many of these

1314
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,680
over there the years or whatever my

1315
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,359
guess is this conversation is going to

1316
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,440
end in we should have a both that really

1317
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,880
does this but i mean i think that we

1318
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,400
have to decide

1319
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,319
you know are we defining the syringe and

1320
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:39,920
what goes in it are we just defining

1321
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,520
like a carrier for the drugs right i

1322
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,800
mean those are two very different things

1323
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,839
to work on

1324
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:47,119
um and i'm i'm i'm arguing for

1325
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,920
we need to have an architecture for

1326
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,920
what's on slide six here the overall

1327
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,440
problem that slide six is trying to

1328
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,200
argue for i'm all totally in favor of

1329
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,920
doing um and i think that

1330
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,520
just what i've heard on the call today

1331
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,200
makes it strong

1332
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,200
it's very clear that there are major

1333
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,720
players where we're willing to work

1334
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,160
together to do something really relevant

1335
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,599
here so there's no lack of energy for

1336
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,200
this

1337
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,200
all right thanks matt did i cut you off

1338
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,800
are you trying to make a point

1339
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,440
no not at all um i i i was just gonna

1340
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,960
respond to one thing that you mentioned

1341
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,880
colin and then um

1342
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,680
the

1343
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,280
the idea here

1344
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,280
you you the idea here is that since the

1345
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,359
credential authority

1346
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,240
is is integrated on the server side with

1347
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,359
both device os oems because even before

1348
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,520
you talk about any form of sharing

1349
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,319
that credential authority knows how to

1350
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:39,599
provision credentials on both devices

1351
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,240
right that exists today to my point and

1352
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,720
so the idea here being when the sender

1353
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,400
initiates the send

1354
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,319
it gathers the necessary material from

1355
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,559
the credential authority that's needed

1356
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,640
to seed the apis no matter who the

1357
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:57,040
receiver is and i i realized that

1358
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,880
that makes sense but i think this gets

1359
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,319
the hardware a little bit different i

1360
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,240
don't think that exists today at all

1361
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,200
okay

1362
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,359
um and your point that it exists for

1363
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,280
merely two of the thousands of different

1364
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,440
types of device os's out there it is is

1365
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,280
an argument that it's is it makes

1366
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,720
exactly my point of why we need to

1367
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,160
why we need to do the overall scope so

1368
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,480
just and i want to be clear here i'm not

1369
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,920
arguing against doing this work i'm

1370
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,760
arguing in favor of this is great work

1371
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,680
we should do it but the work we need to

1372
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,040
do is

1373
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,440
what is your whole slide six

1374
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,400
not

1375
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,880
not not just lines two and four on the

1376
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,400
on the slide that's that's the only

1377
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,839
thing and that that's just my point of

1378
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,440
view i mean i'm sure other people have

1379
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,200
other points of view but that's that's

1380
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,520
sort of my my direction of how i think

1381
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,240
about this so

1382
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,800
awesome thank you why don't we move on

1383
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,200
um rich you get the last spot in the

1384
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,760
queue

1385
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,240
actually pete resnicks does he posted a

1386
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,440
while ago saying he was having

1387
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,079
device problems so the question from

1388
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,640
pete which is sort of a

1389
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,800
elaboration i think of what patrick said

1390
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,800
initially is um are you okay if the ietf

1391
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,720
tears up what you've done

1392
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,880
uh and for example completely changes

1393
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,599
the architecture

1394
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:15,520
yeah that's a great that's a great

1395
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,040
question

1396
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,720
i i'm not 100

1397
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,920
percent sure

1398
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,440
oh there's a bit of an echo here do you

1399
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,520
guys all hear the echo

1400
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,040
maybe it's just me

1401
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,200
um because there is better now

1402
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,559
okay great thanks um like i said i there

1403
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:31,680
are

1404
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,760
large actors in this in this ecosystem

1405
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,079
that endeavor to

1406
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,680
build a solution

1407
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,200
that solves some of the problems that

1408
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,880
i've that i've outlined

1409
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,760
um

1410
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,920
i think i think if it solves the same

1411
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,000
goals and

1412
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,960
and is compatible

1413
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,240
with

1414
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,839
the way that these things kind of have

1415
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,920
to work in the credential authority

1416
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,760
space

1417
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,000
and when i say that i mean there's

1418
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,599
there's a number of entities in the

1419
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,119
world think about assa abloy and hid and

1420
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,680
and these large credential providers

1421
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,040
that provide

1422
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,359
access control systems and key material

1423
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,920
for the majority of corporations in the

1424
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,280
world to be honest between the two of

1425
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,880
them dormacaba

1426
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,079
um

1427
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:18,800
it

1428
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,839
you know that

1429
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:20,800
that

1430
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,720
we need to define something that plays

1431
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,319
into these systems that are already

1432
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,440
there in some way or it will be decades

1433
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,440
before anything like this sees the light

1434
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,720
of day and so

1435
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,359
i think the short answer is it depends i

1436
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,119
think i'm certainly

1437
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,800
and i should say we i mean there's five

1438
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,079
other co-authors on this but um

1439
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,480
we we certainly would love to

1440
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,680
get feedback and make it better um and

1441
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,200
and and i think

1442
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,880
it's it's hard to say without seeing

1443
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,280
where we end up but i do think we're all

1444
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,119
committed to the process and like i said

1445
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,599
this is my first time at ietf but i'm

1446
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,839
i'm really looking forward to discussing

1447
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,760
it in additional detail and seeing what

1448
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,319
we can come up with um

1449
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,240
uh and and and if it's better than what

1450
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,960
we have here and solve the same problems

1451
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,680
then i don't see any reason why we can't

1452
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,720
um

1453
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,280
why we wouldn't adopt it um if that

1454
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,800
makes sense yeah

1455
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,559
yeah so matt i'll just give you a little

1456
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,640
sort of background on why folks ask that

1457
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,400
question so dispatch sometimes sees work

1458
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,240
for what are essentially complete and

1459
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,240
deployed protocols

1460
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,640
for which they're looking for you know

1461
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,960
recognition by a standards body but are

1462
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,559
not willing to

1463
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,079
bring that

1464
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,680
really allow that standards body to

1465
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,640
bring its full consensus to how that is

1466
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,400
going to operate right more or less a

1467
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,079
rubber stamp or nothing

1468
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,839
um which is not really the mode in which

1469
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,079
the ietf operates as a collaborative

1470
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,119
consensus design that has to go on

1471
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,640
what i'm hearing more of you is that

1472
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,000
you've got you know some requirements of

1473
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,920
an existing ecosystem that you want to

1474
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,640
design a protocol to fit into um you

1475
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,480
know that causes challenges of course as

1476
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,240
you go along but that's you know i think

1477
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,680
a pretty reasonable thing to put on the

1478
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,440
table and to work around um that's the

1479
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,119
the distinction i usually see does that

1480
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,440
sort of match um your where you think

1481
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,040
this lies

1482
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,720
yeah i think that makes sense i mean

1483
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,480
there are you know a lot of these

1484
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,920
companies really do want to build a

1485
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,079
solution that solves this problem and so

1486
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:21,839
i think another thing

1487
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,480
that that that i would would mention is

1488
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,920
is is timing right and and you know i

1489
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,920
realized that academically

1490
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,720
um having us discuss and debate for

1491
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,240
as long as it takes to get the right

1492
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,839
answer is obviously the right sort of

1493
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:38,000
theoretical and academic thing but you

1494
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,800
know a lot of times these companies are

1495
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,960
um you know want to launch a solution

1496
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,520
that solves this problem and i i think

1497
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,200
it wouldn't be intellectually honest if

1498
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,599
i didn't mention that there are a lot of

1499
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,599
driving factors here to

1500
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,520
um build something that satisfies these

1501
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,359
goals so i guess what i'm saying is if

1502
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,280
we can establish a working group and

1503
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,680
discuss it and really dig in on

1504
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,680
relatively short order i think that

1505
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,800
would be fantastic i i i truly do

1506
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,880
welcome the changes but if it ends up

1507
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,440
taking you know a year or two or three

1508
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,280
to come up with the right solution i

1509
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,359
think it would be likely that that the

1510
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,119
the companies that have been discussing

1511
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,200
this so far would proceed with something

1512
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,040
that looks like what i presented today

1513
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,359
just in the interest of full disclosure

1514
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,119
no i mean that makes a lot of sense it's

1515
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:24,960
it's often actually a good dynamic when

1516
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,720
the folks that are actively involved in

1517
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,559
doing the work if there were to be an

1518
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,280
eventual working group um feel some sort

1519
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,040
of you know commercial or otherwise time

1520
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,440
pressure that that tends to result in

1521
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,720
good outcomes

1522
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,760
um

1523
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,280
so normally what we do with this part of

1524
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,520
the program um

1525
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,280
is that we thank you for this

1526
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,960
presentation and we move on to the uh

1527
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,079
art area section of our um of our agenda

1528
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,599
and then christy and i will come back

1529
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,280
sort of trying to summarize what we've

1530
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,800
heard in the discussion

1531
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,720
um i am reminded here that i actually

1532
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,720
just want i said i would summarize ted's

1533
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,480
email which did appear to go to the list

1534
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,760
i'm not sure

1535
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,359
why it didn't end up in your mailbox but

1536
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,200
let me get a couple highlights out of

1537
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,480
there for you in case there's anything

1538
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,880
you want to um

1539
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,920
address

1540
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,000
um ted hardy says based on the rest of

1541
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,359
the draft i believe the idea here is

1542
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:12,960
that digital credentials being sent in a

1543
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,000
simple way like an email entitled blah

1544
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,440
don't meet the need because the result

1545
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,440
is not machine readable by the systems

1546
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,400
um he wants to check in if he's correct

1547
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,400
if so uh you may want to consider

1548
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,839
whether device is the right unit of

1549
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,599
discussion since even mobile devices can

1550
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,319
have multiple persona accounts etc think

1551
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,160
of work profiles

1552
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,839
if it's not your document needs a good

1553
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,359
bit of work to rethink some of those

1554
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:38,559
core elements such as account claim um

1555
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:39,920
in the end he thinks the security and

1556
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,359
privacy aspects of this need a fair

1557
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:43,680
amount of work um

1558
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,599
and that leads him to suggest the answer

1559
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,760
to the dispatch question is that a

1560
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,760
working group would be appropriate

1561
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,079
with both app and security folk involved

1562
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,440
yeah

1563
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,040
great great comments and questions i

1564
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,400
mean i think the

1565
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,559
challenging the noun of devices is great

1566
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,880
i mean we've i've debated that myself

1567
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,200
for for for months um

1568
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,200
you know i think

1569
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,200
i i don't see a reason why a protocol

1570
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,440
like this wouldn't work on

1571
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,559
um

1572
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,640
you know another type of device or

1573
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,680
entity like a laptop or a you know pc or

1574
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,440
something like that it would need the

1575
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,480
requisite

1576
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,720
um hardware to provision these type of

1577
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,880
credentials like i said these actors

1578
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,200
with like you know assa abloy you know

1579
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,000
hid they have very strict compliance

1580
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,359
requirements and certification

1581
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:32,559
requirements for the hardware that

1582
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,119
stores the credential itself and so you

1583
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,240
know

1584
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,319
not a lot of laptops and pcs have that

1585
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,160
hardware there's a lot of certification

1586
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,480
involved in a lot of the mobile payment

1587
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,400
industry um just for those those who are

1588
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,440
not involved in in that industry um

1589
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,440
you know pci compliance there's there's

1590
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,000
all kinds of those restrictions but i do

1591
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,839
i do agree in principle

1592
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:55,520
you know challenging the term device and

1593
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,240
what it means is great um i've been

1594
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,359
doing that myself for quite a while um

1595
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,920
on the security uh point wholeheartedly

1596
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,000
agree we have you know been talked about

1597
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,680
that on this farm already the past hour

1598
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,200
quite a bit i think the security of

1599
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,720
and what security primitives we would

1600
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,400
like to guarantee of this protocol are

1601
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,160
really something that truly needs to be

1602
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,839
discussed in additional detail fully

1603
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,558
concur with that point

1604
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,599
all right thank you so much um i hope

1605
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,640
you had a good dispatch uh experience

1606
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,920
yeah thank you so much patrick and

1607

to move on to um the art section of the

1614
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,680
meeting today so that's the end of

1615
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,480
dispatching and um as patrick said we'll

1616
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,760
go away and talk about and come back at

1617
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,200
the end of the session with what we

1618
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,680
think we heard um matt i'd just ask you

1619
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,920
to stop sharing your slides if you can

1620
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,880
because i

1621
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,799
seem to not be able to

1622
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:02,160
thank you

1623
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,280

1624
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,000
um so we can just talk through

1625
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,799

okay hopefully you can see that so we

1629
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,960

we'll talk a bit and then we have just a

1632
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:21,920
couple of items that shouldn't take very

1633
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,160
long at all and so we'll just kind of

1634
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,359

values on wednesday

we have new and nearly new art working

1661
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,799
groups

1662
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:29,280
i wanted to mention ohi which is in the

1663
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,359
security area but because of its

1664
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:36,240
it's so close to art that it would be

1665
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,040

do a triage might help might benefit

1821
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,839
from

1822
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:45,520
somebody in art looking at them and so

1823
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,920
we've been reviewing probably about half

1824
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,599
of the documents that are going to the

1825
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:52,640
iasg something around there and

1826
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,240

1827
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,480

we also have an internationalization

1832
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,359
directorate which

1833
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,119
um pete

1834
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:10,640
uh is the secretary for and it does

1835
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,119
it deals with

1836
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:14,640
internationalization issues collects the

1837
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,640
experts on internationalization and

1838
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,240
where i wanted to mention in the the

1839
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,319
junction of the two is that as we are

1840
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:22,960
reviewing documents for the art area

1841
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,200
we'll sometimes come up with ones that

1842
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,760
we think might need internationalization

1843
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,559
expertise to look at it also

1844
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,839
so if you're doing an art art review and

1845
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:35,440
you see

1846
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,359
things about

1847
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:40,640
character strings saying

1848
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:43,599
how these strings need to be compared

1849
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:46,240
how these strings are used

1850
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,720
particularly things that will be human

1851
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,880
readable or human enterable like

1852
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,359
usernames and passwords

1853
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:55,039
these might be things that should be

1854
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:57,640
passed over to pete as can you get an

1855
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,760
internationalization review on this as

1856
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,880
well

1857
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:01,920
what we

1858
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,480
we intend to come up with a

1859
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,280
um a list of things to watch for that we

1860
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,359
can post and then you can look at those

1861
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:11,280
and and see what

1862
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,920
specific issues raise flags that would

1863
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,000
need an internationalization review so

1864
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,680
we're not expecting everybody in the art

1865
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,920
area to understand all the quirks of why

1866
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,119
internationalization is hard and what

1867
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:24,559
needs to be done

1868
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:25,839
but just to

1869
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:28,000
start to learn a few

1870
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,640
um a few flags that indicate that

1871
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,480
somebody who knows more about this ought

1872
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,400
to take a look at it

1873
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,480
so we'll we'll be posting something to

1874
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,440
the

1875
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,440
art uh mailing list

1876
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,319
once we get a list up that of of of

1877
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:46,240
these sorts of flag issues

1878
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,680
and i think that's all i really wanted

1879
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,839
to say about that uh john clenson if

1880
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,359
you're on is there anything you want to

1881
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:53,359
add

1882
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:56,558
i don't know if john is

1883
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:04,960
on i do not see john on so i uh

1884
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,200
sorry

1885
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,039
having coordination problems

1886
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:09,370
um

1887
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:12,429
[Music]

1888
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,000
i yeah the the

1889
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,880
the the only trick here

1890
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:22,319
um which you didn't mention

1891
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,240
uh but which i think is worth mentioning

1892
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,359
is that there's a little bit of a

1893
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,119
balance problem

1894
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:28,960
uh which is that sometimes we look at a

1895
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,079
document

1896
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,520
sometimes long before we look at a

1897
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,680
document that's coming from

1898
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,119
somewhere else

1899
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:38,799
uh we discover that there are

1900
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:42,240
uh fundamental issues that need to be

1901
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,240
addressed in a

1902
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:47,200
uh internationalization specification

1903
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,359
and we are

1904
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,680
lacking ways to develop and handle those

1905
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,440
specifications

1906
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,960
that and i think it's safe to say that

1907
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,760
any that anybody is satisfied with so

1908
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,640
that's another piece of this puzzle

1909
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,119
but uh but other than that i think

1910
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:08,640
barry's uh very summary is is reasonable

1911
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,440
okay thanks john

1912
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,280
and i guess the other thing i'll say

1913
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,480
about the

1914
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,238
art area review team

1915
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:18,719
is anybody who's not already a reviewer

1916
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,719
on the art area review team and who

1917
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:22,479
wants to help out

1918
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:24,319
please let me know and we'll put you on

1919
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,640
the team

1920
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:31,359
so watch uh again watch for um

1921
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:34,960
for a list of uh of flag issues that um

1922
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,719
that john and i will try to come up with

1923
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,080
and perhaps others on the

1924
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:41,359
internationalization director

1925
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:43,359
thanks for your attention

1926
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:44,158
yeah

1927
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:47,120
one other observation if i can break in

1928
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,600
as as as we are working on a more

1929
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,198
complete list

1930
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:52,799
uh you can assume rewriting your

1931
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:54,560
documents

1932
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,479
that there are going to be

1933
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:58,799
uh two obvious questions as soon as you

1934
01:08:58,799 --> 01:08:59,839
decide

1935
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:02,399
you need characters other than asking

1936
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:05,120
one of those questions is why

1937
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,679
and the other one of those questions is

1938
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:08,880
that

1939
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,399
unless

1940
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:11,920
what you're doing is guaranteed to be

1941
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,839
free text which is never going to be

1942
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:16,479
compared to anything or looked at

1943
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:18,399
other than visually

1944
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:21,120
that writing down uh the equivalent of

1945
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,920
just using utfh is not going to do it

1946
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,238
there are complexities there which i

1947
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:28,479
trust as we put the list together

1948
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:29,920
uh we will

1949
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,000
uh elaborate on

1950
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,880
but uh but but the most common problem

1951
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:35,920
we see

1952
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,560
is somebody who says well this was okay

1953
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,719
and ascii so using utf-8 and everything

1954
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:41,920
will be cool

1955
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,880
and usually innocent

1956
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,839
so that's an early preview

1957
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:48,560
yes good

1958
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,239
good summary on that all right

1959
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:54,640
so thanks that's all i have to say

1960
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,199
great thank you very much both um really

1961
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:59,360
good update there and i i'm going to try

1962
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:03,040
and say tonight the association again

1963
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,840
um right so we're just gonna have a

1964
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,920
final presentation from

1965
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,040
spencer

1966
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,000
um spencer dawkins on media over quick

1967
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
and hopefully you can see those slides

1968
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,600
worse just one slide showing for you

1969
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:19,280
there spencer so take it away

1970
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,159
yeah uh thank and thank you for the

1971
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:24,320
opportunity to do this uh

1972
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,320
the uh

1973
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,360
so

1974
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,679
some of you perhaps many of you remember

1975
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:30,800
the

1976
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,679
video inches of a quick side meeting

1977
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:39,199
from ietf 111 uh that was uh

1978
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,760
quite you know it morphed into something

1979
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,960
bigger than just that and there was a

1980
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,800
media of a quick mailing list that was

1981
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,679
created which was very quiet until

1982
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:53,199
like october 26th

1983
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,120
but it's

1984
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,640
heated up now

1985
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,520
the

1986
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,960
there are lots of people with different

1987
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,800
needs for

1988
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,000
legitimate reasons for uh what they want

1989
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,239
to do with media over quick

1990
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,960
and we need to understand those needs to

1991
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:11,840
do anything at the itf

1992
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,000
we were planning two side meetings on

1993
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,800
media over quick broadly defined

1994
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,320
at itf 112 one on understanding what's

1995
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,679
needed

1996
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:23,199
for the ietf

1997
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:24,800
and one on

1998
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,960

uh afterwards the you should have uh

2008
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,920
live links on this slide uh in the

2009
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:55,520
proceedings for the mailing list and uh

2010
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,719
for the

2011
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:58,239
uh

2012
01:11:58,239 --> 01:11:59,920
where the where the the uh that's

2013
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,239
actually the the side meeting link

2014
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:05,199
uh that francesca uh

2015
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:06,640
was said to say she would put in the

2016
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,199
chat but it's there also as well

2017
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,480
uh

2018
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,960
we are we are uh

2019
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,360
interested in hearing from people

2020
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:18,400
uh with a variety of things on their

2021
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,000
mind uh

2022
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,040
especially uh i think interested in pain

2023
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,000
points

2024
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,800
on what people are not not able to do

2025
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:27,760
now

2026
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,040
uh with various uh

2027
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,239
forms of media streaming uh interest and

2028
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:37,239
distribution

2029
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:41,600
i can take questions now but

2030
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,960
it's probably best if we don't have the

2031
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,679
side meeting here

2032
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,480
thank you spencer if anyone has got

2033
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:53,520
questions please do join the queue

2034
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,360
otherwise as spencer said you can save

2035
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,960
it for the side meeting

2036
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,199
sounds good

2037
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:00,560
thank you thank you all for the

2038
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,280
opportunity to uh say this on monday

2039
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:07,280
morning before the side meeting happens

2040
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,640
now thank you for bringing it's really

2041
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,280
interesting work

2042
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,719
super so we have got um we have no

2043
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:15,920
desire to make the meeting longer than

2044
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,920
it needs to be but we do have time on

2045
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,520
the agenda for

2046
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,880
any other business or anything that

2047
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,719
people would like to mention in the flex

2048
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:25,120
time otherwise um patrick and i will

2049
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,040
just get to our dispatch

2050
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,440
outcome for the one item on our agenda

2051
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,400
today

2052
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,000
i'll just take a pause in case anyone

2053
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,960
does want to join the queue

2054
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,960
as we're navigating meet echo

2055
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,280
functionality still um

2056
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,880
either you have nothing to say or you're

2057
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,480
still trying to find that join queue

2058
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,280
button but uh we'll move on

2059
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,679
and um so patrick and i have discussed

2060
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,719
and we think that the consensus for

2061
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:54,960
the first item and please do correct or

2062
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,440
challenge um in the queue or on java

2063
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,360
we'll just keep an eye on that we think

2064
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,480
that um the outcome was a consensus to

2065
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,199
have a buff on the kind of problem space

2066
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:07,520
constraints requirements whatever word

2067
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,760
you want to give to that but to not

2068
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,760
focus on a solution but to kind of scope

2069
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,159
out the use cases and any constraints

2070
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:15,280
around that

2071
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,400
and we also heard that the community

2072
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,159
would like this work to have a shout out

2073
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:22,800
in sex dispatch so just for awareness

2074
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,600
not to redispatch but we'll um

2075
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,040
see if there's time on the sec dispatch

2076
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,280
agenda just to mention that

2077
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:32,320
and also a note that this belongs really

2078
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,360
more with the sec community than art so

2079
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,040
we're asked dispatchers of the view that

2080
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,800
the work belongs a bit more with sec

2081
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,280
than art but that both communities

2082
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,880
should get to weigh in

2083
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:43,760
on

2084
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:46,880
the discussion and the buff

2085
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,960
so that's um what we

2086
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,320
heard from the group i don't see anyone

2087
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,120
angrily objecting on jabber or calmly

2088
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,120
objecting but i do see cullen in the

2089
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,920
queue colin

2090
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,760
uh yeah i was just gonna ask could you

2091
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,440
be a little bit more

2092
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,360
could you be a little crisper about what

2093
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,679
you want the scope of that conversation

2094
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:08,960
to be around requirements around

2095
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,159
requirements for relay around

2096
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:12,239
requirements for the whole problem i am

2097
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:13,520
i'm not arguing either way i'm just

2098
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,960
asking you to clarify a little bit

2099
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,960
crisper

2100
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,840
yeah no that's um reasonable to clarify

2101
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,320
i think we heard that folks found it

2102
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,159
quite hard to dig the requirements out

2103
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:26,800
of the draft um looking at the solutions

2104
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,040
so a bit more clarity on what the

2105
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,560
problem space is what the problem's

2106
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,239
actually trying to solve i know there

2107
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:34,640
was some analogy going going around but

2108
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,400
just kind of whether it's more protocol

2109
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,159
or whether it's more what's exactly the

2110
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,560
relay architecture or

2111
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,239
that kind of thing patrick would you

2112
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:43,199
like to

2113
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:44,719
add anything

2114
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:46,400
no i mean i would concur largely with

2115
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,159
that i think you know cullen wants to

2116
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:49,520
make sure we address the notion of

2117
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,719
whether the

2118
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:52,480
yeah how much of the whole problem

2119
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,400
statement is in scope

2120
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,159
um and i

2121
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:57,760
one of things i heard is you know that

2122
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,120
should probably

2123
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,640
be

2124
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,080
a little bit of the app community might

2125
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,159
drive the scope there and the suck

2126
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:05,840
community might drive the requirements

2127
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,840
of the individual protocols a little bit

2128
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,120
more

2129
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,560
and that's actually why i think this is

2130
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,800
actually suitable for a

2131
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,760
an ietf wide buff now of course dispatch

2132
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,080
does not give the go ahead for buffs to

2133
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,360
happen but we think this is the

2134
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:20,960
appropriate

2135
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,640
avenue to pursue with this work that it

2136
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,159
needs that kind of

2137
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:28,159
that kind of wider wider conversation

2138
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:30,880
to address exactly the question cullen

2139
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:35,840
is asking i think as part of that

2140
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,920
francesca you just joined the queue

2141
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,560
yeah i just wanted to mention that the

2142
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:47,360
conversation can continue on the

2143
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,840
dispatch or art mailing list

2144
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,880
while we coordinate with the sec ads and

2145
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,920
with the proponents and try to

2146
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,120
um

2147
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:02,280
to get something going in the meantime

2148
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,120
great thanks everyone

2149
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,760
um so now it's nearly

2150
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,360
the end of the meeting

2151
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,960
we just um

2152
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,560
have meetings of interest to highlight

2153
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,320
to you we had this slide on a little bit

2154
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,159
earlier obviously it's the first session

2155
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:19,120
of the week so really um a lot of stuff

2156
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,960
going on this week there's one buff and

2157
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,960
then we've got a few new and nearly new

2158
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,040
artworking groups that um might be of

2159
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,640
interest and then other kind of

2160
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,840
interesting meetings there as well

2161
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:32,080
um i can see that justin jabber um

2162
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,600
richard you said you think doesn't

2163
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,960
belong in sec would you like to just

2164
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,199
come to the mic and talk about

2165
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,759
why that might

2166
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,320
be sorry am i audible here

2167
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,880
yeah it looks like that yeah

2168
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,840
yeah so uh that's just um my my quick

2169
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,840
evaluation on on the credential transfer

2170
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,360
draft but it seems to me like the the

2171
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,960
interesting questions there are around

2172
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,880
kind of the the broader architecture of

2173
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,159
the application

2174
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:02,000
um who the players are what their

2175
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,440
relationships are as opposed to the

2176
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,199
details of the cryptography like there

2177
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:07,280
are like the cryptography needs to be

2178
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,840
arranged properly but i think that's um

2179
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,120
you know an area where we can bring in

2180
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,719
some security area expertise and people

2181
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:14,080
who understand how to do those sorts of

2182
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,640
things um and you know focus on the the

2183
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,239
application architecture

2184
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:21,840
as the more interesting problems

2185
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:22,560
so

2186
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,159
as you said i think this will require

2187
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:26,640
expertise from both sides but i think on

2188
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,480
balance it's slightly more in the app

2189
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:32,239
area than you're in the security area

2190
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,760
okay thanks for bringing that to the

2191
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,120
queue i can see quite a lot of people in

2192
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,120
java agreeing with you as well um i

2193
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,480
think this is because when we asked the

2194
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,679
question in

2195
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:44,640
earlier in jabber about sexual art every

2196
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,560
response that came back said sec but

2197
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,480
it's good to see that there is actually

2198
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,320
um a community that thinks it probably

2199
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,480
belongs more in art as well so

2200
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,040
we'll um yeah i think francesca may take

2201
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,120
that away and discuss with the sec ads

2202
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:58,880
and just sort of work out where it sits

2203
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,000
more

2204
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,679
more naturally but um it's good to have

2205
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:03,199
the feedback from the community so thank

2206
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:04,719
you for bringing that point to the queue

2207
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:06,480
that's super

2208
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,400
yes exactly what you said kersey we will

2209
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,960
coordinate with the adc this might be

2210
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,480
another example of

2211
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:15,120
uh cross area with uh

2212
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,440
the work being done in one area and the

2213
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,000
responsibility being from the other area

2214
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,520
so we'll see but thank you for the

2215
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,840
feedback

2216
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,719
great thanks everyone so with that i

2217
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:28,800
think we're good to close out the

2218
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,000

speaking through my

2231
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:46,159
monitor mic and listening through my

2232
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:47,840
headset we'll see but we are being

2233
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,000
recorded just so you know well that's

2234
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,239
okay

2235
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,080
the end of the meeting will have strange

2236
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,440
speaking on it

2237
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,679
this will come back to haunt him later

2238
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:01,360
and someone said very glad to have a

2239

good okay then this is what i'll do is

2244
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,639
i'll just use the uh

2245
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:16,960
there's a tiny tiny bit of tendiness but

2246
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:19,120
it's

2247
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:21,600
it's

2248
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,080
speak higher in the room and see if it

2249
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:28,000
comes on the mic but yeah nope

2250
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:28,840
all

2251
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,440
right we'll see what we can do about

2252
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,760
getting the mic on my uh headset to work

2253
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:37,360
but this will work for now

2254
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,239
