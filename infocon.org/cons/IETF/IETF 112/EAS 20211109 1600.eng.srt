1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,759
doing the audio check can you hear me

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,519
i'm not able to hear the screen that

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,360
sounds like a reza if you want to join

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,720
the queue that's great your timing is

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,840
perfect

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,279
um welcome back this is our second uh

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,880
tease session

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,480
um we

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,760
uh broke in the middle of a the last

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,720
from the

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,880
previous session but uh first before we

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,880
can get uh we can resume we have to do

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,920
our normal

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,360
administrivia um uh we're required and

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,760
asked to always show our note well uh

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,640
this is to ensure that all participants

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,960
are aware of the process and procedures

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,520
that govern how we operate

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,039
that covers

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,559
both

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,559
the the

22
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,160
what is

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,239
discussed here and that it becomes part

24
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,600
of our permanent record and it's

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,000
recorded and made available it also

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,319
governs how we interact with each other

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,360
uh next slide please and um our

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,799
leadership has oops uh just go to the

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,200
the one after our leadership has asked

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,560
to emphasize

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,560
um our

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,400
that we have a code of conduct it's

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,640
covered in bcp 54

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,560
and um you know to keep it short it's uh

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,439
you know

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,360
please be respectful and courteous of

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,640
others even when engaged in um intense

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,520
technical uh uh discussions which are of

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,360
course encouraged

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,320
um

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,158
the agenda now onto our agenda

42
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,759
so we broke in the middle of or the

43
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,799
middle of slot 4

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,880
which is okay because we actually had 40

45
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,840
minutes of open time right now so we're

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,040
going to give

47
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,439
adrian up to 40 minutes if you'd like to

48
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,880
take it and

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,079
so we're going to start with that and

50
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,399
continue and then all the other

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,479
slots are going to be just pushed

52
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,439
further down in

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:07,840
uh our

54
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,000
hours and with that um back to adrian

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,840
and we had tarik and reza in queue and

56
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,680
they're back in queue

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,400
so thank you um

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,120
while the slide comes up

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,280
it occurred to me during the break that

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,400
uh i may be defending the current text a

61
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,520
bit too forcefully uh i'm the pen holder

62
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,319
and it's it's your text

63
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,840
so

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,720
uh

65
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,800
what we actually need to do is try to

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,920
get some

67
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,280
uh consensus on these these points

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,319
uh that said i propose that we just take

69
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,519
tarik and reza on this slide and then

70
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,360
make some movement through the rest of

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,160
the slides in the hope of of of getting

72
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,280
through them

73
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,239
so uh tarek

74
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,599
trait adrian uh to thank you uh you know

75
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,760
getting clarity on these things uh

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,959
you're doing a great job highlighting

77
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,319
what makes sense

78
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,280
um

79
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,760
my my question now is about the

80
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,000
connectivity matrix id

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,120
uh

82
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,239
and there is a need uh that to group

83
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,040
multiple of these connectivity matrices

84
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,720
if you want to call them or the way we

85
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,400
call them

86
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,840
so that they

87
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,519
match a specific filter criteria

88
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,519
for example if i have

89
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,440
still on point-to-point

90
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,920
basic connectivity matrix

91
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,280
i have two of those and i you know i

92
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,200
want to associate a class of service

93
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,879
with them

94
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,480
do i need to have an

95
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,840
uber grouping of these two

96
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,480
and

97
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,840
is that

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,760
what is the

99
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,640
thought

100
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,839
the thinking is

101
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,840
i think it is likely i'm i'm

102
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,200
i'm hesitant here because you're moving

103
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,159
from

104
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,200
how we

105
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
describe the

106
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,920
slice to the customer

107
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,760
uh and then you're

108
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,680
you're going from that to

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,599
how you would actually start to realize

110
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,320
and deliver the slice in the network now

111
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,079
i i understand that the second is

112
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,759
important

113
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,720
and it is it seems to me very likely

114
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,919
that there is a need to

115
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,840
group together

116
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,240
in delivery

117
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,199
matrices or slices that

118
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,440
have um the same or very similar

119
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,639
service characteristics

120
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,440
okay thank you

121
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,719
reza

122
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,320
thanks again

123
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,400
for the session uh

124
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,800
one comment and one question i guess

125
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,960
from the

126
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
connectivity type

127
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,000
traffic that we see here it's also it's

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,720
good

129
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,000
to consider that one as two group of

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,199
unicast or multicast because for example

131
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,360
point-to-point in this case is unique as

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,600
whereas other one are potentially

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,400
multicast so this is one aspect that

134
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,280
also maybe can clarify

135
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,680
the type of the traffic we have

136
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,520
and uh the there was some comment that

137
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,759
we can group it into two categories

138
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,600
point to point and point to multipoint

139
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,919
and others are the kind of subset of

140
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,039
that we

141
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,400
more or less

142
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,520
i think uh in my opinion this is correct

143
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,199
because at the end

144
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,520
when i go to my session about mbi the

145
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,000
modeling we basically retouch some of

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,440
this aspect

147
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,039
that we have here

148
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,320
and another uh the comment

149
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,400
is about the connectivity metrics when

150
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,440
we say metrics so by definition metrics

151
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,720
means multiplicity multiple role that

152
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,280
and in this case matrix if

153
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,080
we are clear about that means and x and

154
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,199
y when x is sent there why is receiver i

155
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,639
just want to make sure that we are on

156
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,880
the same category because we talk about

157
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,000
the something and the definition of that

158
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,319
is not hundred percent clear vn talks

159
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,400
about connectivity matrix the way that x

160
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,440
and y they can send and i think it might

161
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,520
be a good idea to clarify that in the

162
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,600
framework that very clearly what they

163
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,160
mean with their connectivity metrics

164
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,720
thank you yeah i get you um i think

165
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,600
that's uh that's important

166
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,479
and uh you're also right that getting

167
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,840
alignment here with the um

168
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,600
the nbi or the the service young model

169
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,600
is uh also fundamental yeah

170
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,800
okay i'm going to bow to the working

171
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,520
group and continue then so uh

172
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,000
again

173
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,599
um yes just a few comments from uh i

174
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,039
think some of the other i guess

175
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,599
discussions on mailing lists about this

176
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,960
topic so just so i i think um

177
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,479
what was mentioned just earlier i think

178
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,520
the grouping of unicast you know flows

179
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,000
and then multicast but then as well you

180
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,800
know having that that delineation in the

181
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,919
grouping

182
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,680
but then also you know in the

183
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,599
description i think and it was i think

184
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,840
it may have been commented on as well

185
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,599
like when you look at the functional

186
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,240
categories and then you talk about c to

187
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,160
c so like let's say the network slice

188
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,080
controller you know this is kind of the

189
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,199
overall provisioning of the slices but

190
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,639
when you think about provisioning of the

191
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,080
slices the action is happening on the pe

192
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,280
not the c

193
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,199
but then you have the but then you have

194
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,680
two pieces of it you have the ce

195
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,639
which the the provider side is seamless

196
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,319
to the ce he has its sla and slo and

197
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,759
then the pe is actually doing the

198
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,560
provisioning so when you look at it you

199
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,639
know just like the definition of each

200
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,840
each one

201
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,280
and you're you're you're actually

202
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,960
defining the pe role but then but then

203
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,039
the actual description has

204
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,280
this the end point communication to see

205
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,080
you to see communication matrix so just

206
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,520
a point that you know when you when

207
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,759
you're reading it it does look a little

208
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,759
bit confusing because you're actually

209
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,400
talking about the pe role and actually

210
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,440
provisioning by the controller but then

211
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,520
but then you're actually talking about

212
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,280
descending and receiving like the end

213
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,520
points cen points

214
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,120
another comment all certainly i think

215
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,000
someone had mentioned like is as

216
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,479
since when you're when you think of a

217
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,599
a single

218
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,479
connection or connectivity uh it's c e

219
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,200
to c point to point and then like i

220
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
guess when you think about a uh point to

221
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,760
multiply like say multicast and let's

222
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,040
say like a

223
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,920
source to leaf you know sub lsp

224
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,000
everything i think the building block of

225
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,120
any communication is a single unicast

226
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,600
flow so let's say hypothetically if you

227
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,480
took a a single unicash flow so like a

228
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,560
point-to-point flow

229
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,760
and use that sla and slo

230
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,680
and then you can actually use that as a

231
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,240
mirrored building block to build really

232
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,440
any um

233
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,720
any uh

234
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,279
point to multi-point or

235
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,839
multi-multi-point to multi-point up

236
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,680
communication matrix

237
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,079
thank you

238
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,839
yeah okay heard that um

239
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,240
greg

240
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,200
hello um

241
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,000
i think that well at least my

242
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,920
interpretation of what connectivity

243
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,720
metrics is is uh

244
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,800
not related to

245
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,240
uh data flows that are

246
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,640
traversing it so because um for example

247
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,800
if it's point to multipoint

248
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,959
uh it's not

249
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,600
restricted to carry only multicast

250
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,560
traffic

251
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,519
it can be a unicast

252
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,360
so

253
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,680
that's

254
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,839
in in my

255
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,040
my mental you know uh picture uh these

256
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,519
are different

257
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,000
yes and that's what took us into the the

258
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,040
the

259
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,399
definition of uh any to any

260
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,480
in as much as um

261
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,040
we were trying to previously we were

262
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,839
trying to represent that

263
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,079
multicast flow

264
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,839
in p2mp

265
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,800
not that not the potential

266
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,680
of unicast

267
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,480
flows um

268
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,440
okay uh all i can say is this this needs

269
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,240
to

270
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,200
go round um

271
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,760
uh the the whole loop again and we need

272
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,920
to to bash it out and i'm not sure that

273
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,720
now is the the time

274
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,640
but i have heard that there are many

275
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,480
different opinions about what we should

276
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
be doing here and we we've got to drive

277
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,120
that forward

278
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,279
and not to be out done

279
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,040
uh what have we got uh glenn are you

280
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,279
still in the queue

281
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,959
oh

282
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,440
sorry let me let me remove myself

283
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,760
okay jack

284
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,760
can you hear me

285
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,000
yeah

286
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,959
so uh i think it's important to really

287
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,519
define where

288
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,839
the boundary is right in point to

289
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,279
multipoint

290
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,120
c will still be sending single copy

291
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,040
where p might be replicating if it's

292
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,200
replicated traffic think about layer two

293
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,480
service and flooding right

294
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,639
uh number two it's not necessarily

295
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,680
traffic it's the connectivity model you

296
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,720
describe

297
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,120
commonly known as point to cloud cloud

298
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,320
to pointer cloud to cloud

299
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,519
and it defines sls and even so you might

300
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,519
be sending traffic to everybody amount

301
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,600
of traffic in total could be well

302
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,760
defined right so if you had additional

303
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,680
receiver you might be actually running

304
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,800
out of your quota ascending to cloud

305
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,719
so i think we are really confusing just

306
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,160
yes

307
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,959
interesting yeah okay um

308
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,959
i'm going to fold all this in and try to

309
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,839
come up with a thread on the list

310
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,079
to um to drive this discussion further

311
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,880
so next slide please

312
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,639
we finally made it

313
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,440
yay um yeah so other changes that

314
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,160
happened in o5 um

315
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,880
uh and this will come back still to the

316
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,120
whether we agree on the definition of of

317
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,680
connectivity matrix but we had a debate

318
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,600
about could you have more than one

319
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,440
matrix per slice

320
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,240
and we wanted to allow the operator to

321
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,680
choose

322
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,880
one size per matrix or multiple matrices

323
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,240
per slice

324
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,000
and that's what we've settled on at the

325
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,720
moment it may change with the definition

326
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,959
of matrix

327
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,200
we

328
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,839
had then some uh debate about what is a

329
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,680
service definition

330
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,760
and um polished that

331
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,959
the main issue coming out of it

332
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,000
um was the the connectivity per slice

333
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,839
which we just talked about

334
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,120
and um

335
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,600
what is an end point

336
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,519
and that was issue five

337
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,519
uh and there was a figure at the interim

338
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,880
which has found its way into the draft

339
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,600
um to define the different possible

340
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,760
positions of endpoints

341
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,399
in ce

342
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,519
at the seize port at the pease port or

343
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,959
in the pe

344
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,440
and to add to that we added this thing

345
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,600
called an ancillary ce

346
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,399
to

347
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,639
catch the idea of a service function

348
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,480
which might be somewhere inside the

349
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,720
provider's network

350
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,560
more on that

351
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,839
later

352
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,760
um we uh

353
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,839
added a figure on the realization

354
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,120
process

355
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,639
um uh and that picked up some some texts

356
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,279
from med joel and john drake

357
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,480
um the recent email

358
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,600
uh exchange on that on the list which is

359
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,199
saying that um

360
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,600
these components are fine in the figure

361
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,800
but there need to be some clearer text

362
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,959
uh describing what they are so that's

363
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,199
easy

364
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,560
uh issue seven on the workflow was uh

365
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,519
agreed to make no further change

366
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,600
because the workflow

367
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
is pretty much these things have to

368
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,399
happen but in any order

369
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,160
and then uh there are also a couple of

370
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,959
editorials in it next slide

371
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,079
we're rumping along

372
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,440
uh so this takes us into the further

373
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,600
issues

374
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,480
uh and uh what's needed is an editorial

375
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,519
pass

376
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,720
um

377
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,120
some there's some really stale text in

378
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,920
there uh that i think can be taken out

379
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,560
and there's a bit of duplication

380
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,079
there are a couple of emails um uh

381
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,800
review comments uh kicking around louie

382
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,360
for example sent comments

383
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,320
um

384
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,360
and that needs to be factored in

385
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,399
uh and um i have this open question on

386
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,959
how we define endpoints

387
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,079
we've got

388
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,160
endpoints networks slice endpoints

389
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,839
customer edge

390
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,519
and i think i want to get down to either

391
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,440
service demarcation point or service

392
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,920
at another access point service access

393
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,800
point

394
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,360
sorry service attachment point

395
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,759
service attachment point

396
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,040
is popping up at the moment in the ops

397
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,680
area working group where there's a young

398
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,639
model

399
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,920
that is intended to apply to

400
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,000
l3sm and l2 sm

401
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,279
and other services as well and it might

402
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,440
be really neat if we could

403
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,040
be uh consistent with that

404
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,160
so again that'll be a a posting to the

405
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,600
list and i think

406
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,240
resolving that might actually help us

407
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,880
with our network matrix discussion

408
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,440
um

409
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,959
what else have i got kicking around

410
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,079
uh next slide is is on converging with

411
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,639
8309 and then there's a slide for

412
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,839
technology agnostic and as i said

413
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,880
editorials from various people

414
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,680
um and then i think some

415
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,119
some worked examples for simple services

416
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,199
and mapping those two

417
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,839
connectivity matrices may really uh help

418
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,599
so let's go to the next slide

419
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,000
um

420
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,280
and this is really about do we say nbi

421
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,199
and sbi and uh it's a long-term issue

422
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,240
across

423
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,799
quite a lot of uh sdn based stuff is

424
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,480
that

425
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,240
my

426
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,080
southbound interface maybe your

427
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,600
northbound interface and and calling it

428
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,160
mbi or sbi can get confusing

429
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,520
so a

430
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,919
proposal from med here was to try to

431
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,200
align with 8309

432
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,400
um

433
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,160
and and reference

434
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,039
the existing service models

435
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,080
uh

436
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,799
and then use um

437
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,919
the same terminology across all our etf

438
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,280
network level sort of services

439
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,039
um

440
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,799
i think the nbi is pretty

441
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,440
straightforward we can talk about it as

442
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,360
a ietf network slice service interface

443
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,880
the sbi is a little more

444
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,200
debatable we have to decide is it a

445
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,960
network model or is it a network

446
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,919
configuration model

447
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,360
mapping to

448
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,640
the 8309 terminology

449
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,400
and here is louie with an opinion

450
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,559
so hopefully you can hear you can hear

451
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,679
this time

452
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,799
yeah

453
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,240
okay

454
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,760
in the ietf concept why i mean there's a

455
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,520
idf controller considered for the

456
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,799
network

457
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,559
you're adding another iatf slice

458
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,799
controller even though you have a higher

459
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,440
layer of slice orchestrator i just i'm

460
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,799
trying to understand that idea of

461
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,440
network slice controller what does it do

462
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,240
that i can't get from a orchestrator or

463
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,440
a controller in the bottom

464
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,559
um

465
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,400
so the thing about orchestrators is they

466
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,280
you get them sort of at every layer so

467
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,760
the figure on the right here

468
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,640
is

469
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,039
um maybe the one to look at and and in

470
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:21,840
this

471
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,640
picture the orchestrator is up there in

472
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,559
customer space so the customer is

473
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,919
working out

474
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,280
what

475
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,559
slices they want and then is issuing

476
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,120
the slice service request

477
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,559
so as an operator you you don't have

478
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,919
that slice orchestrator you have the um

479
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,480
the service request reaching your

480
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,640
controller or your well i think it's

481
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,000
called the networks

482
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,080
slice controller in

483
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
in

484
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,520
the uh

485
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,559
in the main document

486
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,600
on the line but the way i look at it is

487
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
i understand i have to build

488
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,240
a network slice orchestrator that is not

489
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,400
specific to a domain

490
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,000
my and and this is we can discuss

491
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,600
further when you get to the ietf slice

492
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,440
control do i need really a controller or

493
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,840
maybe a module within my current

494
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,760
controller that can handle any slice

495
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,919
requests but that's something i mean i

496
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,440
see some people coming online so maybe

497
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,200
they have opinions

498
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,600
yeah and that is exactly the the

499
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
question and that's kind of why the the

500
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,159
figure on the right the figure three

501
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,200
bundles those as uh all inside one

502
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,559
controller

503
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,360
and then actually how it's partitioned

504
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,360
uh in software

505
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,000
um is kind of a

506
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,840
an implementation deployment choice

507
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,520
okay karichi

508
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,919
it's been a while

509
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,200
um so

510
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,200
the the terminology that um was used uh

511
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,159
in the lcvpn service model

512
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,840
it's not one that i'm thrilled with

513
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,720
because um everything is a service model

514
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,919
um but customer and

515
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,159
network is definitely one way of doing

516
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,520
it um

517
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,159
you very rightly point out that i mean

518
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,240
there are some drafts now which are the

519
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,840
l3 vpn

520
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,679
network models

521
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,880
which are not yet the device models but

522
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,679
but they are a network-wide view of how

523
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,679
this might get implemented

524
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,440
and then you need one more conversion as

525
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,840
you have the network controller to say

526
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,640
this is what actually goes on a device

527
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,440
so

528
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,840
but you know i know it's

529
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,480
maybe a little bit gimmicky but calling

530
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,360
them intent model and implementation

531
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,400
model

532
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,480
might be uh helpful because

533
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,400
you know not your northbound is my

534
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,440
southbound your uh i mean you have all

535
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,679
these orchestrators so if you say

536
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,919
customer where the customer really come

537
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,240
in the customer actually might come in

538
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,880
even above all this

539
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,559
so

540
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,840
the idea that you have a model that

541
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,960
abstracts away from the implemented

542
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,559
implementation details so if you say

543
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,360
here the slos i don't know how you do it

544
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,360
but make my network

545
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,600
meet my my slos or my sles

546
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,280
or make their network

547
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,480
meet these assets so in a way you have a

548
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,919
thing that says this is what i would

549
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:30,720
like

550
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,919
and then you have something that says

551
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,799
this is how it's going to be implemented

552
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,120
um and i think that's maybe a little

553
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,200
less

554
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,360
sort of relative than

555
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,480
northbound southbound or customer and

556
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,600
network

557
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,280
um

558
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,760
i don't know i i agree with you that we

559
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,799
need

560
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,600
more uniform terminology across all the

561
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,200
service models

562
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,919
but um i'm just struggling with it and

563
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,919
that's just my current idea

564
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,240
yeah and it's it's certainly true that

565
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,559
we stumbled around for a while on the

566
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,720
definition of customer because there's a

567
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,880
there's a tendency to think of customer

568
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,760
as

569
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,480
the the absolute sort of end user or the

570
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,880
person paying the bill

571
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,000
where

572
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,919
where what we've

573
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,400
defined in this document is a customer

574
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,280
is the the person who makes

575
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
is the entity if you like that makes the

576
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,640
request

577
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,159
for the service

578
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,559
but um we can we can look at that again

579
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,440
and certainly the if there's a robust

580
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,720
definition of intent

581
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,960
better than what the super working group

582
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,360
failed to do then we we should certainly

583
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,039
look at whether we can

584
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,760
glue that in

585
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,840
okay

586
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,639
thanks kiran

587
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,720
just a clarification question that you

588
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,720
have only downward arrows for the

589
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,960
configuration that is intentional i

590
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,960
guess

591
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,600
you collect any runtime or dynamic state

592
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,760
for the configurations

593
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,840
well you'll notice that figure 2 has got

594
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,159
arrows in both directions and they are

595
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,440
the same arrows so

596
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,600
no that's just inconsistent

597
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,399
documentation

598
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,799
okay

599
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,279
lewis

600
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,799
so actually

601
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,320
i was going to bring up the same comment

602
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,679
about configuration we should think of

603
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,279
that as bidirectional even though people

604
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,559
tend to say configuration is

605
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,400
unidirectional but that's good um the

606
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,600
other thing is

607
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,799
i think it would be useful and

608
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,919
the alignment

609
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,200
if you really are going to head to tight

610
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,159
alignment with 8309 is uh

611
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,200
you know

612
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,440
um

613
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,080
look at their use of orchestrator versus

614
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,559
controller because for example they call

615
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,039
that middle box another orchestrator

616
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,200
and on one hand it's really nice to be

617
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,240
aligned with an rfc on the other hand

618
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,559
if the terminology used it causes more

619
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,640
confusion

620
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,919
it's okay not to follow it

621
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,559
yeah point taken i'll talk to the author

622
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,480
of uh 8309 about that

623
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,039
uh

624
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,000
yeah just to confirm your thought on the

625
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,600
endpoints you're right i mean it could

626
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,919
be the customer had the end points we

627
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,840
can have infrastructure endpoints an

628
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,919
example like a cudu

629
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,600
can have customer traffic but their

630
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,039
control plane traffic needs to be

631
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,440
treated differently so the endpoint

632
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,360
could be anywhere right it could be in

633
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,600
the customers could be on the

634
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,000
operator's network uh it depends on what

635
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,679
if it needs any kind of specific or

636
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,440
special treatment than what's normally

637
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,440
offered and by the way and i know a lot

638
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,200
of people mention qos

639
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,039
i always think us is always there

640
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,640
regardless if you're slicing or not so

641
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,960
that protection is always there i i

642
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,480
normally when i look at it i don't

643
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,600
attach qos to slicing it helps within

644
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,279
this license scope but i don't know if

645
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,400
it's some people think qs is slicing

646
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,000
personally you know just my personal

647
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,600
living i don't think it is you know one

648
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,000
for one

649
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,600
yeah okay those are those are both

650
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,080
helpful points and i think that the

651
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,679
um the embedded endpoint ties in with

652
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,960
jeff's comment on

653
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,200
uh point to cloud and and things like

654
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,080
that um for the slos

655
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,640
that's correct thanks

656
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,760
okay next slide

657
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,520
i assume lou is not still in the queue

658
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,559
he's just

659
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,600
he likes waving

660
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,600
um

661
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,400
so there was a question uh on the list

662
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,159
asking about what's

663
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,880
what it means to say technology agnostic

664
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,080
um

665
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,000
uh and so there are a couple of points

666
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,360
here we

667
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,960
we certainly know

668
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,840
that how the service is provided belongs

669
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,039
to um the the operator and not the

670
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,960
customer

671
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,520
and we know that the same service in

672
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,440
other words what the customer sees as a

673
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,440
service could be provided in multiple

674
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,039
ways

675
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,279
according to operator preferences or

676
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,279
according to

677
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,799
technology that's available

678
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,840
but

679
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,799
the traffic supplied by the customer

680
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,640
is um a specific technology

681
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,039
that is it could depend on the encoding

682
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,640
on the attachment circuit

683
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,440
and

684
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,640
therefore

685
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,200
there is some form of technology

686
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,159
specific aspect of a network size

687
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,240
service

688
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,679
and the

689
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,840
wrongly named

690
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,600
attachment circuits

691
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,480
are

692
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,480
of a specific technology so uh the ac is

693
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,720
part if the ac is part of the service

694
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,360
and it is in some of our models

695
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,600
then there is a technology specific

696
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,799
aspect uh even to the point of the ac

697
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,679
itself being sliced

698
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,279
so we have a choice um

699
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,399
we could clarify this by stating all of

700
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,120
these points calling it all out

701
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,880
or we could simply remove the discussion

702
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,320
of um

703
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,840
agnosticism

704
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,559
and my preference here is to say

705
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,480
what's quoted here the service is

706
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,480
agnostic to the technology in the

707
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,080
underlay network

708
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,199
and leave it at that

709
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,360
and i pause a beat while nobody comes to

710
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,760
the microphone which ah hooray good

711
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,279
so i support your opinion because the

712
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,600
way you look at it is inside

713
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,159
on inside the network you can use

714
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,080
whatever you know it's about the what's

715
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,919
in the house right so you can use

716
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,520
whatever technology you want it's

717
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,600
agnostic you can do your slice and

718
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,840
however to receive that endpoint that's

719
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,919
coming from a different domain

720
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,520
i agree that's a technology specific

721
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,720
when we were looking at it we were

722
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,799
looking at the f1 interface the n3 the

723
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,760
n6

724
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,679
and you know and none of those we were

725
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,159
really agnostic we were but to your

726
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,240
point as soon as we identify where the

727
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,399
slides or what is the slides the rest of

728
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,399
it becomes technology agnostic

729
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,520
so

730
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,960
hopefully i said the same thing but i

731
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,200
support that view

732
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,559
lovely thanks

733
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,678
and kiriti

734
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,960
go back to the intent versus

735
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,520
implementation intent um you want to

736
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,120
stay away from

737
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,520
how you do it um so you say this is my

738
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,039
connectivity matrix this is my

739
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,559
requirements

740
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,159
i don't care how you do it so i think

741
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,640
i'm echoing what louie just said

742
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,520
and so the agnosticism

743
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,039
i don't know if i put too many answers

744
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,200
in there is

745
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,960
with respect to how you implement it

746
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,240
yes

747
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,520
yes

748
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,440
i think that's that that was the point

749
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,279
of the original text is it's just the

750
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,039
original text wasn't

751
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,080
clear enough about where that agnostic

752
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,039
boundary was so um i will try to tidy

753
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,480
that

754
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,039
brilliant thank you

755
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,919
next slide then

756
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,039
okay so other issues i'm going to say

757
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,200
let's not raise other issues here and

758
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,000
now

759
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,279
because otherwise we will overflow

760
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,600
please send to the list then i will also

761
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,240
try to capture what we've already

762
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,919
covered in this meeting

763
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,919
as issues on the list

764
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,880
and then next slide

765
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:48,880
so

766
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,559
my plan is to uh get another pass of

767
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,760
this during november um and obviously

768
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,919
raise the issues

769
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,600
uh that have been described there's

770
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,360
enough going on that i think we

771
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,559
have to um push this out probably by an

772
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,240
extra revision

773
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,720
but uh i think we're

774
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,039
with o6 we will be close to a point

775
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,559
where i'm calling on you all to do a

776
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,559
a pretty thorough review

777
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,360
preferably during this calendar year so

778
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,880
that we can

779
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,440
start to tidy up all of the remaining

780
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,640
issues

781
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,519
in uh january

782
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,720
and february and maybe be ready for a

783
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,399
last call before the next itf meeting

784
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,960
that would be my hope because

785
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,200
this document is kind of important for

786
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,799
progressing everything else and if we

787
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,679
can't get consensus on it soon we'll be

788
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,039
slowing down our other work

789
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,399
um

790
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,760
if i may given those 11 minutes can i

791
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,720
share my desktop and share a slide on

792
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,080
the v

793
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,720
vtn uh sorry the vpn plus and slicing

794
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,799
discussion

795
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,080
i will ask to share screen

796
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,200
the slots are taken

797
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,000
so we need pavan

798
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,399
actually i'll do it

799
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,799
there we go yes i really want to share

800
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,399
my screen really really really

801
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,440
and if it's working

802
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,640
yeah it is working you can

803
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,799
oh

804
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,720
come on chair away

805
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,720
hopefully you can see a powerpoint slide

806
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,080
not yet

807
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,120
all right so it's giving me a choose

808
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,279
what to share and here is a grayed out

809
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,120
button where you can only cancel

810
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,120
and retry

811
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,840
yeah

812
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,000
click on that screen above that great

813
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,559
button yeah

814
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,600
all right here we are

815
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,919
i love it when it does that cascade

816
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,760
right

817
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
you've now got it as soon as muteco

818
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,799
actually distributes it

819
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,039
changing topics on us

820
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,000
well yeah this is still slicing and um

821
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and since you said

822
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,840
maybe we can squeeze this in at the end

823
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,519
and since i'm talking and i've got the

824
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,559
slide i thought i might do it at the end

825
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,960
okay all right i'll come back later all

826
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,120
right thanks

827
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,280
uh in which case i think i'm finished

828
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,960
thank you very much for uh running the

829
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,000
last uh almost hour and uh thank you all

830
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,159
to who contributed both here and to the

831
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:22,960
work

832
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,119
uh it's really important and we uh you

833
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,719
know appreciate the timeline and pushing

834
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,000
to get it out

835
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,918
and uh thanks again reza you're up

836
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,480
can you hear me

837
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,639
yes

838
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,599
okay

839
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,760
uh hi everyone on behalf of the

840
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,800
co-authors of uh nbi giraffe i'm going

841
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,639
to present uh

842
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,639
lots of discussion that

843
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,719
i'm going to talk about is already

844
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,359
discussing the previous session you know

845
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,280
connectivity metrics and everything

846
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,520
related to that so this and the concern

847
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,000
whatever is discussed here is just from

848
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,920
the modeling perspective we are not

849
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,480
going to go to the deep dive of this

850
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,320
assumption is the framework is going to

851
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,440
cover that

852
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,400
next slide please

853
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,880
we are going to talk about connectivity

854
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,520
matrix modeling water verb is a kind of

855
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,680
summary of where we are right now and

856
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,880
whether or not this is uh agreed upon

857
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,800
and there are some other the discussion

858
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,720
that

859
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,800
needs investigation

860
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,359
namely network slice connection group

861
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,079
introduction of tag and how

862
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,119
the

863
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,839
realization relates to the underlay so

864
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,400
these are some of the topic that will be

865
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,200
discussed today next please

866
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,839
regarding the connectivity metrics so

867
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,920
it's just a kind of summary of whatever

868
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,280
we just uh

869
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,320
seen so far why we need connectivity

870
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,680
metrics why we need multiple

871
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,359
connectivity metrics again from the

872
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,240
modeling perspective if this is the case

873
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,040
how we can model it and the

874
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,920
how

875
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,800
basically the

876
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,160
type of the traffic will address or will

877
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,680
be included in the model so we summarize

878
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,680
everything into two models the first

879
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,320
slide is option one this is something

880
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,119
that

881
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,680
is included

882
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,200
if you go to next slide please

883
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,400
so

884
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,119
why we need multiplicity of the

885
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,079
connectivity matrices so these are two

886
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,760
reasons that uh you know it's kind of

887
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,800
summary of whatever uh that we deduct

888
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,520
from the discussion mailing list and uh

889
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,599
draft it might be more reasons or there

890
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,160
might be some other reasons that some of

891
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,400
them is not really included here but the

892
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,760
idea here is

893
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,640
we need multiplicity of the connectivity

894
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,079
matrices because one network slice

895
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,160
endpoint again everything is from the

896
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,680
technology agnostic that perspective one

897
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,760
network a slice endpoint can send

898
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,880
traffic with a different type consider

899
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,320
blue

900
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,920
red and green as a three connectivity

901
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,640
matrices that we have so

902
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,440
one endpoint is sending different type

903
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,599
of the traffic potential to different

904
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,200
type of the nse and in the case of red

905
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,680
and green you will see same end point on

906
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,079
the left hand side sending to the same

907
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,960
the endpoint on the right hand side but

908
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,280
potentially the slo is different

909
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,200
and we consider every the technology a

910
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,920
specific term like crash of service type

911
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,839
of services everything

912
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,160
from the modeling perspective is

913
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,760
considered as slo or sla in this case so

914
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,599
the potentially there are different slo

915
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,240
that's supported and two reasons that we

916
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,200
came up why we need multiplicities here

917
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,720
and why we need this because in the

918
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,200
modeling that you will see momentarily

919
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,520
this will be included

920
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,200
there are two options to model

921
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,280
connectivity matrices

922
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,599
next slide is showing you the first uh

923
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,960
option if you go to a nexus slide please

924
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,599
so this is aligned with whatever we just

925
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,640
discard in the framework for the sake of

926
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,400
the argument because they say what is

927
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,119
the connectivity matrix the intention

928
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,079
here is that we try to say they're each

929
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,880
color is one connectivity metric so

930
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,720
in a single

931
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,440
ietf network slice again the assumption

932
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,160
here is we have an only single

933
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,599
atf network slide service it contains

934
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,200
four different

935
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,520
connect

936
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,800
metrics

937
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,200
each color is one of them

938
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,760
definitely each one depends on the type

939
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,000
of the traffic they send

940
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,440
they have

941
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,160
multiple sender and receiver in the case

942
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,720
of you know that everything except point

943
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,839
to point

944
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,839
everything else it seems that most

945
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,960
likely our multicast traffic but we have

946
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,880
some argument before that it might not

947
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,119
be the case but consider everything

948
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,880
first first of all connection is one

949
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,359
directional in the case of red and

950
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,599
orange you will see in the picture that

951
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,720
each one has one direction and the in

952
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,920
most cases each direction has different

953
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,280
slo so multiple slo must be supported

954
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,160
shall be supported by the model because

955
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,400
upper stream and downstream

956
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,280
traffic most likely has different

957
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,240
slos and from that aspect it should be

958
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,079
trivial uh

959
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,240
simple to understand that the multiple

960
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,200
slo

961
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,480
shall be supported by the model and here

962
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,359
the

963
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,920
the intention here is the first option

964
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,480
here is based on whatever framework

965
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,440
described as a connectivity metric

966
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,000
any type of the connectivity for example

967
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,760
consider the orange one

968
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,960
the single point to point once sender

969
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,359
one receiver is one connectivity matrix

970
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,720
consider a matrix as one connection this

971
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,040
is the first option this is what rate

972
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,200
the train will discuss and on the right

973
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,880
hand side connectivity metrics entry

974
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,200
the intention is to try to try to put

975
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,599
some example here to at least give a

976
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,440
context here

977
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,480
i see there is a purity

978
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,119
wants to ask the question but i'm okay

979
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,720
we kind of stop here go ahead with your

980
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,920
question

981
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,640
question um thank you um

982
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,520
so when you have the blue matrix on uh

983
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,400
blue connectivity matrix on the top

984
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,079
i think you tried to say it but i didn't

985
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,200
catch it is it nse is multicasting

986
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,760
through nfc nfc one is multicasting to

987
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,720
nfc six and two or is it two unicast uh

988
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,839
you know is it a total of three unicast

989
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,599
connections um no or

990
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,880
is the point that we try to raise

991
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,839
for example you can have multiple and

992
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,560
when i showed it maybe the second option

993
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,680
that be created but in this case we

994
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,680
consider this is considered as a

995
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,400
multicast one endpoint is sending

996
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,040
traffic to us basically from the date of

997
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,760
the class perspective there is that data

998
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,040
replication

999
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,200
this is one of the important thing that

1000
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,280
again when we define connectivity

1001
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,119
metrics in framework

1002
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,839
we consider when there is a replication

1003
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:29,160
in the data path it's a kind of

1004
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,760
multi-point or point-to-point multiple

1005
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,839
anything that has multi-meaning there is

1006
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,680
a new progression in data path

1007
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,000
everything else which is not for example

1008
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,160
point to point at the end of the day you

1009
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,240
can have an end to end the

1010
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,640
multiple endpoint on the point to point

1011
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,440
but

1012
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,920
they are sending unicast traffic they

1013
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,000
all each node can talk to each other but

1014
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,480
necessarily traffic from one node goes

1015
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,520
to another node and that could be from

1016
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,520
implementation point of view you can

1017
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,520
have abandoned spoke or full mesh for

1018
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,680
example but this is a clarity

1019
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,440
clarification that we

1020
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,400
the

1021
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,400
the attempt was to

1022
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,240
put it here whether or not this is

1023
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,079
something that foreign is going to

1024
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,640
address it very clearly and we bring it

1025
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,119
here this is just the

1026
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,839
intention so far whatever he understood

1027
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,040
from uh what were discussed in africa i

1028
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,359
hope i answered

1029
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,079
you did but um i'm still a little

1030
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,760
confused because

1031
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,240
if you're trying to describe the con the

1032
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,520
slos

1033
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,839
for the multicast connection from nse

1034
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,760
one to nfc6 and nse2 at the same time

1035
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,200
but there are physically different

1036
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,440
distances different you know fiber paths

1037
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,280
and different all kinds of things

1038
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,760
how do you describe say delay i mean do

1039
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,640
you give the minimum delay or

1040
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,960
because you know the the

1041
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,400
even though you're multicasting and

1042
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,319
replicating the traffic the

1043
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,079
characteristics of the traffic over

1044
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,560
different parts will be different so how

1045
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,119
do you model the slos

1046
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,520
yeah good question and if you go back to

1047
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,079
the right hand side the third bullet is

1048
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,480
basically addressing that so

1049
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,640
each connection can have different slo

1050
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,359
so whether or not we consider that

1051
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,839
connectivity in this case from nse one

1052
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,079
to six as one connection to an sc2

1053
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,920
another connection you can potentially

1054
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,119
have multiple slos but maybe this is

1055
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,040
addressing the option too if we go with

1056
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,480
option two

1057
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,200
this is there may be clarify we clarify

1058
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,400
that but values or multiple solos should

1059
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,560
be supported and i think you gave just

1060
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,520
an example of why we need that one we

1061
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,480
want to have different characteristic uh

1062
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,560
for each of those connectivity that you

1063
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,280
see in this picture with the different

1064
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,760
potential slo they might be the same i

1065
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,000
mean this is very trivial case but they

1066
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,720
might be different as well

1067
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,359
if you allow me let me just go to option

1068
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,599
two and after i take question maybe in

1069
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,520
the option two we answer some of the

1070
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,960
question that you have in option two

1071
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,880
it's very similar in the previous one

1072
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,880
the id that identifies a connectivity

1073
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,480
metrics was a new

1074
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,760
id that we introduced it could be

1075
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,000
integer could be a string could be what

1076
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,800
have you in this case the picture is

1077
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,359
very similar but just consider the red

1078
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,200
connectivity and black this is a bit

1079
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,240
different from previous one in this case

1080
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,280
the red connectivity matrix

1081
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,240
has multiple nses that's sending the

1082
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,640
traffic so basically you have a single

1083
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,079
red

1084
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,960
connectivity metrics and in this case

1085
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,440
the key is not only than id but it is

1086
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,000
the id which is red in this case blue

1087
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,319
red is that id it could be integer or

1088
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,400
could be a string and type of the

1089
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,440
traffic with this one basically you can

1090
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,920
address the connectivity block as well

1091
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,960
between two endpoints you can

1092
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,200
potentially can have multiple

1093
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,560
connections with different slos and one

1094
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,920
example is not the example one example

1095
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,599
is for example in the orange for the 5g

1096
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,960
they ask about having multiple keywords

1097
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,040
inside an end-to-end network slice this

1098
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,240
is again one example that why we need a

1099
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,800
feature or a characteristic like this

1100
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,640
but in this case

1101
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,520
as mentioned connectivity matrix could

1102
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,720
be anything i put it blue red but it

1103
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,520
doesn't mean necessarily is the a string

1104
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,640
it could be an integer it could be

1105
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,599
type of the class whatever we

1106
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,079
we can select here it can be there but

1107
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,400
just for the sake of the technology

1108
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,480
agnostic we call it id

1109
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,960
now i can go to shafang's question

1110
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:56,720
hi already

1111
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,119
the comprehensive

1112
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,200
we are discussing here

1113
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,240
is the

1114
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,040
exact reason why i'm against

1115
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,880
multiple

1116
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,400
connectivity matrices in a single slice

1117
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,000
so the same feature and same

1118
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,640
functionality can be achieved by

1119
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,240
multiple sizes

1120
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,240
and each of them

1121
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,520
will have only one connectivity magic

1122
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,319
that's become thank you yeah

1123
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,920
this is one point and actually the model

1124
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,319
that we have in the draft right now is

1125
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,480
exactly as you mentioned the assumption

1126
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,960
here is we have a single connectivity

1127
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,800
metrics because of the reason that you

1128
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,119
say if a customer wants to create

1129
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,720
connectivity blue

1130
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,800
why they have to put in this one into

1131
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,480
network slice one

1132
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,720
create another network slice network

1133
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,200
slash two itf network slides two and put

1134
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,160
that one there this is exactly valid

1135
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,440
reason and this is at the group we have

1136
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,880
to think about it whether or not

1137
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,880
multiple connectivity metrics shall be

1138
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,760
supported or not but either or is fine

1139
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,720
with uh modeling but this is the model

1140
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,680
this way because of existing

1141
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,040
framework which addresses this way that

1142
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,520
multiple connectivity matrices shall be

1143
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,280
supported

1144
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,079
here you you have exceeded the allotted

1145
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,079
time can you rush through the remaining

1146
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,280
slides and then take questions

1147
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,359
okay no problem so let's go to the next

1148
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,160
question uh the next slide please uh

1149
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,000
sorry the italo we can take your

1150
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
question at that so

1151
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,720
there are other aspects for example

1152
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,200
there is one uh discussion about the

1153
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,359
network slice connectivity group and the

1154
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,440
whole idea here is and if there is an

1155
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,760
endpoint sending traffic to multiple

1156
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,280
other endpoints

1157
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,119
maybe the aggregation of the

1158
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:48,960
characteristic for example each one

1159
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,160
sends a

1160
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,880
one gig but

1161
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,640
accumulatively the total traffic should

1162
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,920
not exceed above a certain a certain

1163
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,960
amount

1164
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,040
in this case we need to introduce

1165
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,440
network slice connection group again

1166
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,559
this is under discussion we

1167
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,680
will be providing more information in

1168
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,480
the

1169
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,640
mailing list the next topic is tag

1170
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,599
if

1171
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,040
if you go to the next slide please

1172
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,480
multiple slo should be supported again

1173
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,000
this is a discussion that we went

1174
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,079
through it this is more information why

1175
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,640
it is the case what are the use cases

1176
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,960
support a multiple slo is one aspect

1177
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,640
that

1178
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,280
is needed to be completely clarified

1179
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,559
with the connectivity metrics next slide

1180
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,880
is i think about the

1181
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,920
tag why we need tag we used to have tag

1182
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,720
but it was removed uh based on some

1183
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,680
comments so we believe that co-authors

1184
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,920
believe that there is a need for having

1185
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,160
a tag which is a kind of association

1186
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,599
quote-unquote between network slice itm

1187
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,800
network slice and higher layer consumer

1188
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,960
again this is uh we'll be discussing the

1189
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,119
mailing list but just that gives a heads

1190
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,440
up that this will be one

1191
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,160
and i think i'm i have one more slide at

1192
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,558
the end

1193
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,319
so

1194
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:21,359
there is a discussion about how the via

1195
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,839
from the northbound the underlay

1196
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,480
information in some cases will be given

1197
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,319
to the network slice controller maybe

1198
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,480
the the operator or maybe the

1199
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,480
orchestrator sitting at the top knows

1200
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,200
how to realize the transfer slice in the

1201
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,520
network is this possible for that to

1202
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,640
influence network slice controller to

1203
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,119
specify the underlay and how to do it

1204
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,440
this is one aspect again it needs

1205
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,599
investigation but i think it's a good

1206
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,359
thing to discuss it whether or not is

1207
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,240
needed depends on use case this might be

1208
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,880
uh relevant to our discussion and from

1209
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,400
that uh

1210
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,520
uh

1211
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,680
i i'm done

1212
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,000
and uh we need the

1213
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,400
more distributed one

1214
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,760
yeah let's take one quick question from

1215
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,760
italo and then we can move to the

1216
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,200
non-working group documents no problem

1217
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,480
can you go back to slide six

1218
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,200
yeah i think

1219
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,000
in this case uh well it doesn't matter

1220
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,079
in my opinion if you allow this

1221
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,280
situation

1222
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,040
when you get a packet from the asus link

1223
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,520
you have three three steps the first

1224
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,520
steps is you have to know which access

1225
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,920
link the packet is coming from the seven

1226
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,680
steps you have to say to understand

1227
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,480
whether the packet belongs or not to nsa

1228
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,480
number four and then you have three

1229
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,319
steps you have to understand whether the

1230
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,079
packet that goes from nsa number four to

1231
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,520
when i say number eight

1232
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,760
should go over the red or the black so

1233
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,440
you have three types of criteria that

1234
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,520
you have to configure for traffic

1235
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,880
classification

1236
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,280
while with option one you have only two

1237
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,319
you have to

1238
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,800
understand the link and then

1239
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,440
whether which nse the packet belongs to

1240
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,599
and this i think is the key difference

1241
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:05,200
between the two options and have to be

1242
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,319
clarified in the framework yeah yeah

1243
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,400
right so this one addresses their very

1244
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,720
last portion that you mentioned but

1245
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,800
anyway your summary is correct thank you

1246
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,720
for your attention uh

1247
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,559
back to you

1248
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,880
okay um so next up we have tarik this is

1249
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,800
the start of the non-working group draft

1250
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,559
portion we're going to really try to

1251
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:27,920
stick to

1252
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,240
the allotted time max 10 minutes

1253
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,160
hopefully a little less just because

1254
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,400
we've managed to fill up all the slop

1255
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,319
time with good discussion on the working

1256
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,599
group

1257
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,240
drafts so turk

1258
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,040
okay thank you

1259
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,079
hi everyone i'm going to give an update

1260
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,400
on revision 4 of

1261
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,559
the solution to realize network slices

1262
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:51,440
in

1263
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,760
ip and mpls networks

1264
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,480
um i am talking on the behalf of the

1265
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,880
co-authors and i thank all of them for

1266
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,559
their contribution next slide please

1267
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,160
so my update uh well the agenda consists

1268
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,040
of the updates i'll go in details about

1269
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,280
each one on the slide and then i'll

1270
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,200
close off with the next steps next slide

1271
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,439
please

1272
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,400
so summary of the updates we go before

1273
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,720
we go deeper uh i've

1274
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,960
we went ahead and incorporated the new

1275
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,440
term network resource partition this has

1276
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,119
been debated on the

1277
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,760
keys mailing list and agreed on so we

1278
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,040
went ahead and

1279
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,079
and incorporated it in our solution

1280
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,640
uh we have expanded on the steps

1281
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,359
required to uh to realize the solution

1282
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,800
uh for itf network slices in the

1283
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,559
in the transport network

1284
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,520
using our solution of slice aggregates

1285
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,800
and uh lastly we have addressed review

1286
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,480
comments from several working group

1287
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,000
participants

1288
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,079
i will talk more in detail about each

1289
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,280
one of those

1290
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,760
next slide please

1291
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,480
so it's a network resource partition

1292
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,440
it's useful to you know uh flash some of

1293
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,559
the

1294
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,160
uh terms that we used in our solution uh

1295
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,319
document uh

1296
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,280
first slice aggregate uh a collection of

1297
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,960
packets that match the slice policy

1298
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,200
selection criteria and are given the

1299
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,720
same forwarding treatment as slice

1300
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,960
aggregate comprises of one or more ietf

1301
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,960
network slice traffic streams

1302
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,480
or flows the mapping of one or more of

1303
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,640
such uh uh

1304
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,680
fro

1305
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,200
streams or flows

1306
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,119
uh into an aggregate is maintained in

1307
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,359
the idf network slice controller the

1308
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:40,240
network resource partition uh

1309
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,079
our understanding of it is a collection

1310
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:43,520
of resources

1311
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,000
that are used to support the slice

1312
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,119
aggregate

1313
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:50,319
and lastly the slice policy is a

1314
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,800
construct that enables the instantiation

1315
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,520
of

1316
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,960
uh

1317
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,359
the behaviors on the select topological

1318
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,160
elements the enforcement of the slice

1319
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,280
policy on those uh elements will result

1320
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,520
in the network resource partition what i

1321
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,440
want to highlight from these three

1322
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,839
definition of the

1323
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:11,599
terms is the network resource partition

1324
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,160
is instantiated on a set of nodes and

1325
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,040
links

1326
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,720
using

1327
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,720
policy

1328
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,280
network slice controller is the one that

1329
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,359
aggregates the idf network slide streams

1330
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,839
into and forms a slice aggregate or a

1331
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,040
grouping of those streams

1332
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,119
the slice aggregate traffic streams

1333
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,400
share a common set of slos

1334
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,880
and i consequently are given the same

1335
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,559
foreign treatment by the traverse nodes

1336
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,799
and lastly the slice aggregate traffic

1337
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,839
is steered on the specific network

1338
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:50,720
resource partition associated with this

1339
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,400
slice aggregate

1340
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,200
next slide please

1341
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,079
as i mentioned we have introduced a

1342
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,240
number of steps and no

1343
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,440
no definite order we're not dictating a

1344
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,640
specific order in order for realizing

1345
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,880
the itf network slice service

1346
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,160
um

1347
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,799
i'll just go over them one by one but

1348
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:16,240
not in details i'll leave uh interested

1349
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,280
parties to go and read our draft for

1350
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,760
the specific details so we talked about

1351
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,520
network topology filters slice

1352
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,240
aggregation mapping path placement on

1353
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,119
the specific topology associated with

1354
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:30,960
the slice aggregate

1355
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,599
the slice policy installation

1356
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,599
or instantiation of the

1357
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,520
network resource partition path

1358
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,319
instantiation service mapping and

1359
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,319
relationship between different

1360
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:45,520
network slice aggregates

1361
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,839
next slide

1362
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:48,640
please

1363
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,400
i mentioned that we got some review

1364
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,559
comments and we did address them in this

1365
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:53,599
revision

1366
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,559
we thank all who have read our draft and

1367
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,920
gave comments so jimmy and robin

1368
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,079
had provided some comments and we've

1369
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,280
addressed uh some some of those

1370
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,559
they were mostly editorial nets

1371
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,280
last ietf 111

1372
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,839
zafar had some feedback to incorporate

1373
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:19,440
some of the sr building blocks draft

1374
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,200
that he had

1375
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,680
into our draft and he was he he did

1376
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,640
signal an intention to join

1377
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,880
we took from our side we took an action

1378
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,200
item and we addressed

1379
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,520
this we did try to incorporate some of

1380
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,480
the

1381
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,079
building blocks

1382
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,559
related to sr in our draft

1383
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:39,680
and

1384
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,640
we've given zafar a chance to review the

1385
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,599
the

1386
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,400
updated revision we're still pending uh

1387
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,319
any feedback from him

1388
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,319
uh maybe he didn't get a chance to

1389
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,559
review the latest revision

1390
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,040
but we did give him a chance to do that

1391
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,680
uh lastly

1392
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,079
we did clarify the relationship of

1393
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:05,280
our solution to diffserv

1394
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,400
we are

1395
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,160
highlighting that this serve is not

1396
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,200
mandated by our solution but if it is

1397
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,440
enabled it will allow us to do

1398
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,440
or to support multiple classes of

1399
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,920
service on the same network slice or

1400
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,119
same uh sorry network resource partition

1401
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,319
uh i.e hierarchical qs

1402
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,599
support for hiker goku us

1403
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,720
uh next slide please

1404
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,280
before you go there if you go back one

1405
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,240
sec

1406
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,720
sure sure um so there's actually been a

1407
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,119
little mail uh i think about zafar's

1408
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:41,839
draft and um

1409
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:43,599
it looks like there's room

1410
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,760
there's still not closure or alignment

1411
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,799
between

1412
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,880
this draft and is that what zafar's

1413
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,319
looking for

1414
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,480
if you can have that discussion at play

1415
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,640
out that would be great um and feel free

1416
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,240
to have it on the list and so the

1417
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,599
working group is understanding what's

1418
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,799
going on but uh zafar at least on email

1419
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,720
says that there's more to do

1420
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,799
and if we have time

1421
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,720
at the end maybe we'll uh give him a

1422
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,799
chance to talk alright thanks

1423
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:12,400
sure thing no problem thank you lou

1424
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,880
uh in terms of next steps the author

1425
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,880
authors think that the document is ready

1426
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,440
to be adopted

1427
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,680
we do welcome further review from the

1428
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,760
working group and any feedback is also

1429
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,040
also welcome

1430
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,359
thank you

1431
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,000
jimmy

1432
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,960
tariq

1433
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,119
yeah uh first of all thanks for the

1434
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,400
update uh solve some comments from our

1435
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,119
site and uh i think uh

1436
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,440
one of the one of the major issues left

1437
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,920
is about determining terminology i think

1438
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,200
following the

1439
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,400
consensus from the discussion we will

1440
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,400
prefer to use the generic terms for the

1441
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,799
slice realization in the end delay

1442
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:59,920
so that it is related to the

1443
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,559
terminology like the slice policy slice

1444
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:04,799
policy topologies last modes policy

1445
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:06,880
modes etc

1446
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,720
um another

1447
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,720
terminology uh i have raised the

1448
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,640
comments in the middle east is about the

1449
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,799
slice aggregate i think

1450
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:16,799
it's the usage in the text has been

1451
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:19,440
changed to network resource partition

1452
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,400
from this version and i think

1453
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,119
it is important to clarify what it means

1454
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,680
and also clarify where it should be used

1455
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,440
and how it should be used in the draft

1456
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,480
thanks jimmy so let me clarify the the

1457
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,640
the definition of slice aggregate in the

1458
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,040
in the current revision it's clear the

1459
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,520
size aggregate and network resource

1460
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,799
partition

1461
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:43,839
um

1462
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:45,599
play different roles and they are

1463
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,440
distinct and

1464
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,040
and it's cloud

1465
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,359
clearly stated in the draft what each is

1466
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:54,559
uh what is playing the role of each uh

1467
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,799
now if you still have any ambiguity

1468
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,400
please phrase it and i will try to

1469
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,799
address it definitely in terms of

1470
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:03,280
terminology we did in you know align

1471
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,760
with what uh the working group has

1472
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,079
proposed in terms of network resource

1473
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:09,359
partition

1474
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:10,720
um

1475
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,720
we we feel that uh we

1476
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,200
co-authors think that it

1477
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,400
has

1478
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,160
quite an important role to play and we

1479
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,040
we

1480
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,799
feel

1481
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:28,559
it's important to keep in the solution

1482
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:32,160
but i'm welcome to hear more

1483
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,598
feedback is also will come

1484
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,440
do the next two quickly please

1485
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,559
me

1486
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,400
hello

1487
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,960
i can hear you robin go ahead okay uh

1488
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,960
tariq in fact the uh champion from

1489
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:53,920
huawei

1490
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,599
in fact i proposed my comments about the

1491
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,559
terminologies slicer cricket

1492
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,319
in the middle east

1493
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:05,280
so that's used my original understanding

1494
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,240
about celeste aggregate is the underlay

1495
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,880
network slice but uh

1496
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,839
but now it seems to change to this to

1497
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:15,839
identify this the

1498
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,720
nicest network slicer stream

1499
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:22,839
but i i wonder the yeah i i have

1500
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:25,839
this is a little confusing even in your

1501
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:28,880
slides you mentioned that that is the

1502
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,520
slice aggregate topology i don't

1503
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,160
understand how to define technology for

1504
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,799
a group of the streams of the network

1505
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:40,240
slice and the second one i i think

1506
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,559
that's the another job to mention that's

1507
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:45,839
the slice aggregated augmented to cope

1508
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:48,640
with the problem of the apn

1509
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,720
i'm not sure that's what's the other

1510
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,680
scope of this the slice aggregate

1511
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,559
is the identifier of some of the flow or

1512
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,000
is it just

1513
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,559
confined to some specific

1514
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,480
network slicing

1515
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,720
related things

1516
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,079
is

1517
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,039
your voice chopped up on my side so i uh

1518
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:11,119
uh restate the question on the list if

1519
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:13,760
it's not already covered and to take the

1520
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,440
response to the list

1521
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,400
um zafar if it's super quick uh please

1522
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,920
go ahead if not please respond on the

1523
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,160
list

1524
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,799
is offer

1525
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,480
uh it's gonna be super quick yeah so i

1526
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,960
we i had a discussion with arik uh but

1527
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,280
we have not reached an agreement and uh

1528
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,359
we are seeking uh working with option

1529
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,200
for the building drug draft

1530
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,520
uh as well

1531
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,640
well if we're going to combine the

1532
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,559
documentation it's better to combine the

1533
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:48,880
documents and then move to working group

1534
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,599
adoption of a unified document

1535
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:54,720
um so let's see what happens with uh

1536
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,039
your the work to bring these two

1537
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,359
documents together and again feel free

1538
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,680
to have the discussion on the on the uh

1539
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,599
on the list if that helps

1540
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,280
and thank you thank you for the

1541
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,880
presentation everyone thank you for the

1542
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,799
comments and we have to move to the next

1543
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,119
slide

1544
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:14,520
thank you

1545
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:19,440
hello

1546
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:22,079
can you hear me

1547
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,280
okay

1548
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,599
uh hello everyone this is judo and i'm

1549
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:27,440
going to give an update about the

1550
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,680
scalability considerations for the vpn

1551
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,039
plus on behalf of the co-authors

1552
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:35,359
okay next page please

1553
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:38,400
or can i control it

1554
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,880
okay a quick recap of the vpn plus and

1555
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,880
the vtn concept

1556
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,200
the vpn plus framework is described in

1557
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,160
the ts enhanced vpn draft

1558
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,319
one of the typical use cases to deliver

1559
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,880
itf network slices service

1560
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,160
and the rvtn is a concept which consists

1561
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,720
of a set of dedicated or shared network

1562
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,359
resources and it is associated with a

1563
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,680
customized logical topology

1564
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,760
the vtn can be used at the virtual

1565
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,319
underlay to deliver the enhanced vpns on

1566
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:12,720
vpn plus service

1567
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,720
as shown in the figure on the right side

1568
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,200
we can have multiple one or multiple vpn

1569
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,160
overlay services mapped to one specific

1570
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,599
vtn

1571
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:23,680
as a virtual entertain

1572
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,839
and with the widely deployment of the

1573
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:27,680
network slide services uh the

1574
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,319
scalability of the vpn plus and vtn

1575
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:33,520
becomes an important factor to consider

1576
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,200
in the solution design

1577
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,440
so this document provides scalability

1578
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,640
considerations of the vpn plus and vtn

1579
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,200
it analyzed the scalability in the

1580
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,599
control plane and the data plane it also

1581
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:48,079
proposed optimization mechanisms to

1582
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:50,559
improve the scalability

1583
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:51,520
okay

1584
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,839
next page

1585
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,760
okay so uh here are the proposed

1586
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,760
scalability optimizations for the

1587
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,720
control plane basically it is suggested

1588
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,319
that we can

1589
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,319
uh use a shared control protocols

1590
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:09,359
instance or session among multiple vtns

1591
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:11,520
so that we can reduce overhead for the

1592
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,440
session maintenance and also for the

1593
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,559
information

1594
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:16,640
distribution in the network

1595
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,280
the second point is we can

1596
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,680
try to use a shared

1597
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,359
uh shared the policy-specific

1598
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:26,000
computation among multiple videos

1599
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,119
when there are multiple ideas which uh

1600
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:32,079
associated with the same topology they

1601
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:34,160
can use the shared spf computation

1602
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,000
result for the

1603
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,720
for building their following entries

1604
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,960
and the third point is we can rely on

1605
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,039
the hybrid control plane which uh with

1606
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,280
the help of the centralized controller

1607
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,760
and that you can use together with the

1608
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,160
distributed control plane for parts

1609
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,839
computation for the information

1610
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:54,480
distribution so that we can balance the

1611
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,240
load between the controller and the

1612
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,599
distributed

1613
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:59,760
control plane

1614
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,559
okay

1615
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,119
next page please

1616
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,839
for the data plane scalability

1617
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:08,799
optimization the proposed mechanism in

1618
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,799
this document is

1619
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:13,280
try to decouple the resource identifier

1620
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,839
from the topology specific identifiers

1621
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:18,559
used in packet forwarding so the general

1622
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,319
approach is we can use a separate

1623
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:21,920
identifiers to

1624
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,079
uh identify the topology and the

1625
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,960
destination or the past

1626
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,960
and in addition we

1627
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,440
can introduce a dedicated identifier to

1628
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,039
identify the

1629
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:36,480
resources associated with the vtn

1630
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,240
based on this mechanism we can

1631
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,039
instantiate it in the different data

1632
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,079
planes

1633
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:44,480
for the ipv6 data plane we have proposed

1634
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,119
to use the ipv6 hover hub extension

1635
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:49,280
header to carry the vtn resource

1636
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,480
identifier and there's also a discussion

1637
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,520
in the

1638
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,359
npr smoking group and other working

1639
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,319
groups about how to

1640
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:00,400
carry this information in ampere's data

1641
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,839
plane

1642
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:04,880
okay next page

1643
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,559
uh here we summarize the updates in the

1644
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:10,000
latest version

1645
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,559
uh first we update the descriptions in

1646
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:14,400
abstract and the introduction

1647
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,799
so that it aligns with updating the

1648
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,359
enhanced vpn and also the update in the

1649
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:21,760
itf network slides draft

1650
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,520
we also refine the described

1651
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,280
descriptions about the scalability

1652
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,480
requirements

1653
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,720
about the vpn plus services and the

1654
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,119
underlyings

1655
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:32,799
the description about the data plane

1656
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:35,039
scalability and the description about

1657
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,880
the data plane optimizations are also

1658
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,240
refined

1659
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,000
i will also add the security

1660
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,280
consideration section in this version

1661
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,079
next page please

1662
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,200
here are some history about the weeping

1663
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,359
plots and vtn drafts

1664
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:54,079
we have proposed that the has vp of vpn

1665
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:59,119
plus framework in 20 2017

1666
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:01,440
and has been adopted in

1667
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,119
2019

1668
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,520
then we proposed a segment routing based

1669
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,440
uh vpn plus mvtm mechanisms in 2018

1670
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,880
and the work has been adopted in spring

1671
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,480
earlier this year

1672
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,238
uh i start best the mechanism is

1673
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:18,319
suitable for the small or medium scale

1674
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,238
network slide scenarios

1675
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:21,439
and then

1676
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:23,759
after that it proposes scalability

1677
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:26,880
considerations for vbl plus in

1678
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:27,839
early

1679
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:30,799
2020 and after that we have four updates

1680
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:33,040
in the past 20 months

1681
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,198
so that we also have the solution work

1682
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:38,000
based on this scalability considerations

1683
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,158
and optimizations ongoing in other

1684
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,520
working groups

1685
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,520
so on the right side this shows the

1686
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:47,040
relationship between this work and the

1687
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,439
network slides work in the

1688
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:51,279
case working group so we have this

1689
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:53,839
general framework describe the concept

1690
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:56,560
and the overall framework for the slice

1691
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,679
service then we have the realization uh

1692
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:02,238
based on the vpnt and other technologies

1693
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,319
at the leaping plus framework

1694
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:06,080
then for the realization we can have the

1695
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,479
either sr based mechanism for the slice

1696
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,560
realization based on the resource aware

1697
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,679
segments and we all can also have this

1698
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:15,439
high scalability network slice

1699
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:17,439
realization based on this

1700
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,839
uh scalability optimizations and the

1701
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:21,520
data plane resource identifiers

1702
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,158
introducing different data planes

1703
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:25,359
okay

1704
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,920
next page

1705
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,640
for the next steps i think

1706
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,719
this document provides a

1707
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:34,640
detailed scalability analysis and

1708
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,719
optimizations for the control plane and

1709
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:39,600
data plane of the vpn plus and vtn

1710
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,920
add a complementary to the scalability

1711
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,399
considerations in the vpn plus framework

1712
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:46,158
and provide guidance to the protocol

1713
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:49,639
extension work

1714
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:52,080
regarding the terminology in this draft

1715
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,679
we think

1716
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:55,520
based on the recent update of the itf

1717
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,280
network slide draft

1718
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,600
we can refer to the generic term net

1719
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,600
resource partition

1720
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,239
in that draft and we can clarify that

1721
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:06,880
the dvd in this document in the context

1722
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,280
of the network uh vpn plus is the

1723
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,199
equivalent to the natural resource

1724
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,280
partition in the content of itunes

1725
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,360
neutralizing

1726
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,520
based on the scalability mechanism we

1727
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,440
will collaborate on the protocol

1728
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:22,719
extensions based uh in the

1729
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,719
different control protocols

1730
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:27,840
with other draft authors

1731
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,960
for this draft uh the authors think this

1732
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,360
version has been stable so we would like

1733
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,960
to request for the working group

1734
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,000
adoption on it

1735
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,080
thank you

1736
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,559
comments

1737
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,400
we have time for a couple of quick

1738
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,760
questions sir

1739
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,120
yeah

1740
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,520
uh can you hear me yeah

1741
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,360
hello yes

1742
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,480
okay thanks um um my question i would

1743
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,880
like to see more alignment with

1744
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,880
the terminology that the working group

1745
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,040
is adopting i think you're right raising

1746
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,159
that

1747
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:04,800
so network resource partition

1748
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,080
should

1749
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,480
be used instead of vtn and i would like

1750
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,520
to see vtn go away

1751
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,239
before we uh call this ready for

1752
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:15,280
adoption

1753
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,480
and the

1754
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:20,080
second uh point i have is

1755
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,600
i don't think uh

1756
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,920
adding vtn id in the packet or carrying

1757
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,280
the id itself inside the packet

1758
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,159
is too restricted restrictive uh

1759
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:31,760
associated to the

1760
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,239
we can have multiple mechanisms or

1761
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:37,520
selectors to ma to map traffic to one

1762
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,280
network resource partition that you are

1763
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,120
mandating getting

1764
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,159
an id inside the packet and yeah these

1765
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:46,560
are my two questions feel free to

1766
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,159
and i'm willing to take them offline if

1767
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:51,440
you want on the mailing list

1768
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,600
okay maybe a quick uh

1769
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,800
reply

1770
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,560
may i

1771
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,040
yeah regarding the terminology i think

1772
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,600
we have agreed to refer to the generic

1773
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,320
term uh whether it should be a

1774
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,239
replacement or a

1775
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,199
reference that term it is determined by

1776
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,000
the

1777
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,480
relationship between the slice work and

1778
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,400
the between plus work which we can we

1779
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,520
may discuss further offline

1780
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,880
for the

1781
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:22,320
id based mechanism as i mentioned we can

1782
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,800
have either the segment routing resource

1783
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,679
aware seed based solution which is uh

1784
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:29,679
suitable for the small or medium sized

1785
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,199
network slices

1786
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:34,080
the id based mechanism is uh can improve

1787
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,159
the scalability and i think this is also

1788
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:37,280
what you

1789
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,560
you have uh

1790
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,040
described in also the in your draft

1791
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,440
so both magnum can be used in the data

1792
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,239
plane right

1793
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,320
okay so uh we're out at the end of the

1794
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,640
slot i apologize to the person in queue

1795
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,120
i thought we would have time for them um

1796
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,719
if you can take the list that would be

1797
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:56,560
great um

1798
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:57,760
i

1799
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,360
will take the discussion on working in

1800
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:03,120
group adoption to the uh to the list

1801
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,960
i think if uh anyone who has objections

1802
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,560
please don't wait for the adoption call

1803
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,960
please start talking about it right now

1804
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,360
uh and the

1805
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,199
the point on alignment is is quite

1806
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:16,640
important

1807
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,440
the vpn plus can have work have scope

1808
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,600
outside of slicing so you know think

1809
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,679
about that as you're doing your update

1810
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:26,400
um with that we're going to move uh to

1811
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,000
the next

1812
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,080
it is uh

1813
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,840
i think is it uh tarik again

1814
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,560
and we're going to cut you down to nine

1815
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,159
minutes because we slots running a

1816
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:40,560
little over thank you

1817
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,520
i think i might i may give you back some

1818
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,440
minutes here but but i don't see the

1819
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,600
slides yet okay um

1820
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,719
so this is the update on revision two of

1821
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:53,199
the slice policy inc data model

1822
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:55,360
uh again on the behalf of the co-authors

1823
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,480
next slide please so the update is

1824
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,280
straightforward this time

1825
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,199
we did incorporate the network resource

1826
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,840
partition i did talk about that in my

1827
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,199
earlier

1828
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:10,000
presentation we replaced

1829
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,040
previously with we had an said

1830
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,960
to identify the network resource

1831
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,280
partition id uh

1832
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,239
partition we have introduced the nrp id

1833
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:21,920
instead

1834
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:22,800
and

1835
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,480
we've

1836
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,480
updated certain leaf descriptions

1837
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,879
accordingly

1838
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,600
uh

1839
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,480
to align with the topology filter data

1840
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,360
model

1841
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,719
uh and

1842
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,600
it's a it's it's basically a

1843
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,239
next path change to make it

1844
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:46,718
compile

1845
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,800
absorb the top-level container change so

1846
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,040
these are the two changes that we had in

1847
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,640
this revision

1848
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,880
next slide please

1849
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:57,679
so

1850
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:00,880
uh in terms of uh you know we always uh

1851
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,199
welcome further review and feedback to

1852
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,480
the data model

1853
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,840
this is an important data model about uh

1854
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,840
sorry about the slice policy that

1855
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,920
instantiates the network resource

1856
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,600
partition in the network

1857
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,800
um

1858
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,640
we request uh we think that the the

1859
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,560
the model right now is in a good shape

1860
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,280
to be adopted by the group so we request

1861
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:27,040
working group adoption thank you

1862
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,679
to roof is in the queue and i'm happy to

1863
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:36,320
answer your question

1864
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,080
yeah thanks direct uh

1865
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,480
i posted my comments on the

1866
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,000
on the chat as well regarding the

1867
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,280
terminology

1868
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,320
and uh

1869
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,159
right now we say basically the slice

1870
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:49,120
policy results in the creation of the

1871
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,120
network resource partition to support

1872
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,679
slice aggregate so i think this like the

1873
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:55,920
term itself slice policy is not making

1874
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,640
too much sense now since we have uh like

1875
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,120
you know map we don't map a slap a

1876
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,600
single slice here so i think we need to

1877
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,679
re-look at the terminology once again

1878
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:07,520
and even when we look at the yang model

1879
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,679
this part becomes quite confusing so

1880
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:11,440
just a comment that like you know not

1881
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,199
just with this document but the document

1882
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:15,440
that you presented earlier as well that

1883
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,000
terminology is something worth looking

1884
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:18,719
at

1885
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:20,880
and second comment like while looking at

1886
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,600
the yang model in the section about php

1887
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,000
where you are describing the rate and

1888
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,760
shaping uh

1889
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,360
i think either we need to add a little

1890
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,199
bit more description or maybe use

1891
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:33,760
references to some other document which

1892
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,920
describes those things in a much better

1893
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,000
way because right now when you read the

1894
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,159
young model it's not very clear how is

1895
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:41,679
this getting applied like you know this

1896
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:43,120
whole bandwidth how is it getting

1897
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:47,440
applied uh to a particular nrp uh that's

1898
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,120
not very clear so just think about those

1899
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,360
things would be my comment thank you

1900
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,480
sure daruf uh definitely if it is thin

1901
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,239
on description we were willing to

1902
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:57,440
elaborate

1903
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,920
and uh on the terminology yes uh we're

1904
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,800
opened uh um you know at least for the

1905
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,880
slice policy uh

1906
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,679
we had a discussion among co-authors and

1907
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:09,679
we're hoping if the working group thinks

1908
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:11,600
that calling it another

1909
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,560
partition policy helps we are willing to

1910
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,120
uh you know

1911
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:21,840
to take that input as input acceptor

1912
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,640
robin

1913
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,640
my comment to you that the data model

1914
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,360
depends on the solutions of the data

1915
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,280
plane and the control plane

1916
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:37,040
but i don't think that the solutions of

1917
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:40,000
the data plane under the control plane

1918
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,840
is a stable

1919
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,880
so i mean that this dependency should be

1920
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,960
solved before this young model be

1921
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,600
determined

1922
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,679
i'm not sure why you want a couple uh

1923
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:59,600
you know

1924
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,159
the data model with uh

1925
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:04,960
um i mean we are aligned with uh with

1926
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:09,040
the slice definitions uh draft framework

1927
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,679
and we if you have any points that you

1928
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:13,920
want to raise uh feel free if we are

1929
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,480
diverging

1930
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,199
my comments because of you for example

1931
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:20,000
the

1932
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,880
for the ipv6 the encapsulation or the

1933
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,880
ipr's encapsulation

1934
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:25,840
to

1935
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,920
how to encapsulate the

1936
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,040
the

1937
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:29,920
uh

1938
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,440
the id

1939
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:35,920
and also this what's the yeah and what's

1940
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:39,360
how many piece for this id

1941
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,000
so robin if you've read that the the you

1942
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,800
know if you give it a read then you will

1943
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,280
see that we have covering multiple uh

1944
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,640
options for

1945
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:52,719
uh you know having these selectors

1946
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:55,840
for ipv6 and mpls as well so multiple

1947
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,159
options out there

1948
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:00,320
but that's either that's my concern

1949
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:04,480
maybe there's no multiple options

1950
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,320
we have references to

1951
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,800
where each option is coming from it's

1952
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,560
not uh yeah so i mean we can take it

1953
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,800
offline and i can point out each

1954
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,040
okay

1955
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,280
hi

1956
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:26,960
hi terry can you hear me yeah yeah

1957
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,159
yeah

1958
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:30,960
i read the draft and the draft status

1959
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,520
flash policy model is also a controller

1960
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,600
model right

1961
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,600
that's correct yeah it can be device and

1962
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,760
controller correct

1963
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,000
yes but uh

1964
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,760
the model uh current model has only one

1965
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:46,480
uh

1966
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,520
bandwidth resource reservation for each

1967
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,760
slice policy so

1968
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:56,000
i'm thinking when instantiating and

1969
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,280
network resource partition instance

1970
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:02,560
do you think all links in a

1971
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,520
network resource partition instance

1972
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,320
uh

1973
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,280
uh all the same

1974
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:13,280
uh so bo actually the model allows uh

1975
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,480
you know um configuring different

1976
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,480
bandwidth profiles for different parts

1977
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,600
of the

1978
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,679
topological elements in the network and

1979
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:23,120
this is the reason we introduced

1980
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:25,840
topological filters or topology filters

1981
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,880
so you can in in the model you can say

1982
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:29,760
my

1983
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,000
blue part of the topology i want this

1984
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,040
much bandwidth for this

1985
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,840
network resource partition and in my red

1986
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,199
admin groups

1987
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:41,440
and this is just an example i want a

1988
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,760
different bandwidth so it allows you to

1989
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,920
do that

1990
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,679
oh that's not quite clear in the model

1991
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:54,000
because right now the

1992
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,360
okay it

1993
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,239
also regarding the like like control you

1994
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:01,360
you use you mentioned in the model that

1995
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:04,400
there could be have a controller playing

1996
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,560
uh

1997
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,239
like uh

1998
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:11,920
mod mode and also some data playing mode

1999
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,600
but uh

2000
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,320
it seems that network resource partition

2001
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,679
only have uh controller control plane

2002
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:21,280
and uh

2003
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:25,120
resource uh and id but i don't see that

2004
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,679
there's some data playing resource uh

2005
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:28,880
like

2006
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,679
uh associated with this network resource

2007
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:32,800
partition

2008
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,280
there is no i think that is missing

2009
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:38,320
there no no no it is a data plane

2010
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,560
resource reservation i mean data please

2011
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,480
and data plane resources are part of the

2012
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,960
data model and i um you know i'm happy

2013
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,679
to point you to that

2014
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:48,960
yeah

2015
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,199
okay

2016
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,440
hope there will be more example to show

2017
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,040
how

2018
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:00,800
in three modes how we can uh

2019
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,400
doing that

2020
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,120
okay yeah maybe your point taken i think

2021
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,920
we need examples about how do we do each

2022
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,520
one of those

2023
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,040
points you're raising

2024
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,360
thanks

2025
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,400
okay well uh thank you very much um

2026
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,320
it seems like there's some good

2027
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,320
opportunity for follow-up on the list

2028
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,880
and uh would last the folks asking

2029
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,679
questions as well as the authors to try

2030
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:27,120
to take that you know continue the

2031
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,320
discussion

2032
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:32,480
um i believe uh reza europe

2033
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,080
yes

2034
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,480
when we have the co-authors i'm going to

2035
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:37,600
present

2036
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,600
one of the application of the itunes

2037
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,920
network slice in the context of 5g and

2038
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,600
in specific how

2039
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,040
the mapping

2040
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,520
should happen and what are the options

2041
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:48,960
that we have

2042
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,600
next slide please

2043
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:57,679
but if we look at the general uh the

2044
01:22:57,679 --> 01:22:59,440
management of the

2045
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,320
in 5g into a network slices in this

2046
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,480
example and as discussed in the

2047
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,880
framework document i think it's

2048
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,320
important to understand 5g is one of the

2049
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,800
applications or the use cases of itf

2050
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,360
network slice as a technology that it

2051
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,679
was clearly defined in the framework

2052
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:20,159
document that itf network slice is a

2053
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:22,560
technology that provides various use

2054
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:26,080
cases one of the use cases 5g and in a

2055
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,719
specific in the context of the 5g the

2056
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:31,199
way that end-to-end net focus lies from

2057
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:32,400
the left

2058
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,480
if you look at the bottom uh picture

2059
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,280
from left which is your ue it could be

2060
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,159
your cell phone your i o or iot device

2061
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:42,560
could be cc tv and what have you to the

2062
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,880
right hand side which is a upf and which

2063
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,520
basically addresses the

2064
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,360
connectivity which you need us for that

2065
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,360
ue to the network so from this

2066
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,520
perspective it is really end-to-end

2067
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,440
context it has

2068
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:58,800
various domains run domains transport

2069
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,800
domains and the 5g coordinates to create

2070
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,960
these end-to-end network slides

2071
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,760
based on the theory gpp this is a kind

2072
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,719
of summary of whatever is proposed there

2073
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:13,040
is an entity sitting at the top and you

2074
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,120
see the acronym on the right hand side

2075
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,800
basically there is an orchestrator

2076
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,639
sitting at the very top which is

2077
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:21,360
orchestrating creation of end to end and

2078
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:25,280
delegating it to the access network a n

2079
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:26,400
to the

2080
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,400
transport which is idf network slice

2081
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,280
controller and to the core which is sca

2082
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,000
whatever you see nssmf is basically the

2083
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,520
controller so any acronym with nsm means

2084
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,400
a n controller domain controller or cn

2085
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:44,159
i'm simplifying it but the idea here is

2086
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:46,400
orchestrator at the top send the request

2087
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,480
to create

2088
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,080
access

2089
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,679
slice

2090
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:54,880
chorus slice or any slice

2091
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,120
there is a title here it should say cnn

2092
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,880
slice identify

2093
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,440
and it sends a request to it network

2094
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,280
slides this is a discussion that we have

2095
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,600
for last hour or so to create quote

2096
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,159
unquote connectivity between them so the

2097
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:10,960
whole idea here is that there is one

2098
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,000
identifier from the 3gpp and from the

2099
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,400
end to end context it's called network

2100
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,679
slice selection ids and ssa this is just

2101
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:22,400
a 32-bit number it has a semantic but

2102
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:24,719
for the our discussion consider that

2103
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:27,520
there is an id which is used during the

2104
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,320
signaling from 3gpp from the ue to the

2105
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:33,280
network which identifies the whole

2106
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,120
end-to-end network slide so from our

2107
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:36,960
site how we can take from that

2108
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,520
transporter specific how we can take

2109
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,360
this id

2110
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,440
as nssai

2111
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:46,800
to map it to transport and there should

2112
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,360
be same question for a n and c n but our

2113
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:52,560
discussion today is explicitly from the

2114
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,920
transport perspective so

2115
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,840
if you go to an extra slide we try to

2116
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,480
basically formulate this question into

2117
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:01,920
more detail

2118
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,560
so you will see here that for an example

2119
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,800
there is an end-to-end network slice

2120
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,280
with the id at the very top zero one one

2121
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:12,159
one is a 32-bit number as i said

2122
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:13,760
it creates

2123
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,719
some

2124
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:17,280
a-n-s slice access network slice and

2125
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,840
there is an id allocated you know what

2126
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,480
the controller to that same thing there

2127
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:26,159
is some network slides uh the item

2128
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:28,880
network slice will be created the id6

2129
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,600
and same thing for the uh access for the

2130
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,080
cn for the core network so the whole

2131
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,960
idea here is at the end of the day

2132
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:40,480
am is connected to the transport network

2133
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:43,520
through the network of pes and same

2134
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:46,080
thing cn is connected to bs the idea

2135
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,960
here is when the traffic from the am

2136
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,679
look at the data plane the bottom line

2137
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:54,639
at bottom portion of the picture when

2138
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:57,600
the traffic arrives from the a n

2139
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,639
it should have some identifier this

2140
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:03,120
identified we call it ida because there

2141
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,120
is no specific

2142
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,840
agreement what that should be and what

2143
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,760
the acronym should be but consider that

2144
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:12,800
one as a itf network slice internet

2145
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,920
working identification that packet comes

2146
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,520
to the network to the pe and pe knows

2147
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,320
how to map that phone to itf network

2148
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,880
slides with a specified id again we put

2149
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,360
idb because we can

2150
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:30,400
discuss what that should be

2151
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,480
it seems that there is a question i can

2152
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,239
take the question right now if it's

2153
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:37,199
related to this uh slide uh kirtaki

2154
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:38,560
please

2155
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,440
um

2156
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:40,239
so

2157
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:42,800
you're saying the ida is in the data

2158
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,840
plane in the packet as opposed to a

2159
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,440
conceptual identifier i mean it's

2160
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,840
possible that the pe could say i'm going

2161
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:53,440
to use a five tuple you know ip ip5

2162
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,719
tuple or incoming interface and

2163
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:59,280
vlan id to do the mapping

2164
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,760
instead of having an actual id in the

2165
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,199
packet

2166
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:04,800
but from what i hear you're saying it's

2167
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,560
an id in the packet

2168
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,560
no not i didn't imply what are the

2169
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,800
solutions for example you mentioned vlan

2170
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,120
this is one potential solution

2171
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:15,520
this traffic which is coming from am to

2172
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:16,639
pe

2173
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:19,280
potentially will have some identifier

2174
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,280
whether or not is in the packet ip

2175
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:23,120
packet itself because at the end of the

2176
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,400
day that traffic which is coming in 3gpp

2177
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,400
term they call it gtp tunnel but it's

2178
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,159
basically nothing but

2179
01:28:30,159 --> 01:28:33,760
iep on top of udp so potentially that ip

2180
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,400
can come with a vlan and that vlan is

2181
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,320
identified we are not implying that

2182
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,520
there is an id internal to a packet and

2183
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,600
the whole draft try to basically

2184
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,639
formulate the options that we have i'm

2185
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:48,719
just doing the time check here i i go

2186
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:51,040
with the try to finish the slide and if

2187
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,280
there is a time we can take question uh

2188
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:56,000
at the end let me just go to that

2189
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,600
but it's very important question that

2190
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,920
you asked we are not implying that there

2191
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,719
isn't a specific id attached to the ip

2192
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:04,960
what are the potential solution that we

2193
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,600
have is basically addressing the track

2194
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:11,840
if you go to the next slide please

2195
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:16,639
so uh

2196
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:19,280
there are some update that happens uh to

2197
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,080
the

2198
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:22,400
version four there are lots of detail

2199
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,800
added some of the terminology which is

2200
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,560
not really needed

2201
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,960
has been removed or revised and i'm

2202
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,639
encouraging people to take a look at

2203
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:32,719
this one you know there are fresh look

2204
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:34,960
at the problem especially we try to

2205
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:37,440
align it with the itm network a slice

2206
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:40,719
draft and basically simplified as well

2207
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:42,560
if you go to next slide there are some

2208
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,719
clarification about some of these as

2209
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:47,840
much as i have time so you will see here

2210
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,159
that the whole idea of the

2211
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:53,360
the creation of end-to-end network slice

2212
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,600
assume that this is these three colors

2213
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,440
that you see here there are three

2214
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,920
end-to-end network slices the whole idea

2215
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,880
here is when the traffic goes into one

2216
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:06,000
of these the let's pick the green one

2217
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,080
when the traffic from the access site

2218
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:11,360
comes to the itf network slide server

2219
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:14,560
what are the characteristics of that ip

2220
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,960
traffic which is coming and what

2221
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,679
can

2222
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:20,400
specify i need to connect to

2223
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,679
the

2224
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:23,760
network slide screen versus blue for

2225
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,840
example this is the whole idea of the

2226
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,760
problem statement that this drive tried

2227
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,679
to address

2228
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:33,440
this is just an example of that if you

2229
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,559
go to the next slide

2230
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,520
the clarification between whatever on

2231
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,600
the left hand side the picture that you

2232
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,560
will see this is the view of the 3gpp

2233
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,320
that there is an orchestrator sitting at

2234
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:47,600
the very top

2235
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,360
there are three controllers for three

2236
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,440
domains for the access for transport

2237
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:54,239
from the for the core the terminology

2238
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:56,000
that we use

2239
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,679
the attempt here is to map it to

2240
01:30:57,679 --> 01:30:59,920
whatever we understand basically from

2241
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:03,440
the perspective of the the transport

2242
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:06,480
side the ietf network has a controller

2243
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,440
quote unquote that tnssmf is equivalent

2244
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,920
of that and anything sitting at the very

2245
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:14,239
top is just an orchestrator in our

2246
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:17,120
terminology that entity is the consumer

2247
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,920
that versus customer this is one of the

2248
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:23,199
the topic that adrian also mentioned but

2249
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:25,199
at the very end there is an entity

2250
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:27,840
sitting the northbound of the network

2251
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,840
slice controller and there is something

2252
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,080
south once from our side basically we

2253
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,080
are addressing only whatever is

2254
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,000
happening at the idea network slice

2255
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,679
controller and this mapping is

2256
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:40,480
clarifying or mapping what we have so we

2257
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,719
have only maybe

2258
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:44,960
less than a minute to finish up the

2259
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,560
thought here if we can quickly go

2260
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,120
through this slide next one please uh

2261
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:52,159
so there are two ids itm network a slice

2262
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:54,400
identified so what is that

2263
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,679
based on what

2264
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:57,360
another mention we have to come up with

2265
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,760
that id and also internet

2266
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,159
these are the two ideas that we have and

2267
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:04,000
if you go through the document if you go

2268
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,480
to the draft now it says how we can map

2269
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,880
these two id together one example is

2270
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,400
whatever that

2271
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,400
mentions for example vlan is one but

2272
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,920
it's not the only option there are

2273
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,840
values options discussed in the draft

2274
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,760
and the whole idea here is we are not

2275
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,880
imposing any specific the mapping is

2276
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:23,679
just trying to list all the potential

2277
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:26,880
problem potential solution that

2278
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,560
exists today and in this context we just

2279
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:33,120
trying to put everything together and

2280
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,560
for the

2281
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,560
if you go to the next slide

2282
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:37,679
we are

2283
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:41,280
seeking more uh comments and uh

2284
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,679
also the the the

2285
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:46,159
real thing that we are in the reach to a

2286
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:47,199
stable

2287
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:49,280
part which we are aligned with the itm

2288
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:52,080
network slice draft the framework and we

2289
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,719
are seeking for the the next step and

2290
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:57,360
potential adoption thank you very much

2291
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:59,360
and i don't know if you have time to go

2292
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,280
through one question we love

2293
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:05,120
the way but uh if it is please do it no

2294
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:07,120
the way you might just want to speculate

2295
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,440
jump in before into the queue on the

2296
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:10,800
next one yeah i'm going to make the

2297
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,440
topic of course i apologize

2298
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,199
yeah let me make comments real fast if

2299
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:16,719
that's what you want me to do i mean we

2300
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:18,400
can take it off the list or i can do it

2301
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,239
on the list go sure make your comment

2302
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:22,159
and then take it the response off list

2303
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:23,520
so i'll tell you you need to you know

2304
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,600
from the picture i see n6 interface i

2305
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,760
don't see how it applies to the f1u i

2306
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,520
mean see the n3 interface i don't see

2307
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,520
how it applies to n6 and f1u so that's

2308
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,440
one thing to consider another thing to

2309
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,520
consider you might have multiple vu's

2310
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,080
talking to the cu multiple ceos talking

2311
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,280
to upf

2312
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,440
if you understand this take your model

2313
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,600
when somebody mentions vlan make sure

2314
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,360
you understand the use case before you

2315
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:46,960
propose a solution so we can talk

2316
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,960
offline but let's try to apply to the

2317
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,639
use cases see if this is efficient or

2318
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:51,440
not

2319
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,639
definitely

2320
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:54,880
i simply put it here but we can talk if

2321
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,960
you want uh we can have more detail on

2322
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,280
that but uh yeah the point is taken

2323
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:00,239
thank you

2324
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:01,679
and please continue the discussion on

2325
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:03,199
the list i believe there was interest in

2326
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:05,760
a pr and a past meeting in this document

2327
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:06,560
we had

2328
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:07,360
you know

2329
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,639
gotten some indication from the working

2330
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:10,480
group there's interest in this work

2331
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:13,360
um so please discuss it on the list and

2332
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:14,719
you know i think we're headed towards

2333
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:15,840
adoption

2334
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:19,920
uh but we're not quite there yet um

2335
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,199
robin

2336
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,679
okay yeah uh this legend being from

2337
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:30,080
huawei uh my presentation is the

2338
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,719
framework for end-to-end ietf network

2339
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:34,239
slicing

2340
01:34:34,239 --> 01:34:36,879
next slice

2341
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,199
okay here this is the background in fact

2342
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:42,880
this has been

2343
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:45,280
talked many times in the previous

2344
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:48,000
section so here you see the quickly so

2345
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
the first that's the

2346
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,560
there's the cloud from the design team

2347
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,480
define the concept and the general

2348
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:58,320
framework of ietf network slice and also

2349
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,880
we have this realization based on the

2350
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,040
vpn plus and the

2351
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:06,639
vpn plus and the vtm so this is

2352
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:09,520
we also have the sr-based vpn plus

2353
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,360
mechanism

2354
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,080
and

2355
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:15,920
now that's because in the past work

2356
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:18,719
major is for the single domain but

2357
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:20,480
because of the

2358
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:23,760
deployment of this the network slice so

2359
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:26,800
that the ietf network slice mixed by

2360
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,960
multiple network domain

2361
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:31,440
in each domain traffic of networks line

2362
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:35,520
service is mapped to a local uh vtm so

2363
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:38,159
this document used to describe the

2364
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:40,880
framework for realizing and to end the

2365
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:45,679
ietf network slice and next size

2366
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,520
okay so here this is just this is the

2367
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,760
brief this introduction about this three

2368
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:55,280
system this is about this framework

2369
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,840
for the realization we have this

2370
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:02,080
sr-based network slice realization

2371
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,320
now that we also have the scalable

2372
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,280
network slice realization to decouple

2373
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:10,880
this network slides and the topology

2374
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,840
now this is for the under to under ietf

2375
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:17,280
network slice realization to implement

2376
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:19,840
atm networks like the spanning multiple

2377
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:23,360
network domain so this is the drought

2378
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,239
okay next one

2379
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,560
okay so here are these you adjust this

2380
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:34,719
end to end

2381
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:37,760
net itr network slides

2382
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:40,480
so here i see there's this

2383
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:43,360
the top layer this is the 5g and the 200

2384
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:44,960
network slice

2385
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:49,520
which is identified by the s and iss ei

2386
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:52,000
so that's in the transport network

2387
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,040
segment the 5g network slides

2388
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:59,600
can be mapped to an ietf network slice

2389
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,400
for the ietf network slice

2390
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:06,880
it can be realized with multiple domain

2391
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,760
vpn plus service

2392
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,800
and also in the analyte network the

2393
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:15,840
multiple domain vpn plus service is

2394
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:20,159
supported by a multiple domain read here

2395
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:23,280
which is comprised by multiple

2396
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,840
intra-domain retunes in the different

2397
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,040
domains

2398
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,520
so here we can we have these the

2399
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:32,800
different layers of this the id so that

2400
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:36,480
we have this the 5g network slice

2401
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,880
id s and ssi

2402
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,679
and also we have this the ietf network

2403
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:42,800
slice

2404
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:46,080
service spanning multiple domain that is

2405
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:47,280
a global

2406
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:50,159
vtm and for each

2407
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:53,040
domain we have this is the local

2408
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:54,239
vtm

2409
01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:57,360
okay next slice

2410
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,920
okay so here this user just summarizes

2411
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:02,880
this

2412
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,520
identifier so that's a user

2413
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:08,320
for each domain a local retune is

2414
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:11,199
carried in the packet to identify a set

2415
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:13,440
of network resource reserved for the

2416
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:16,480
retain in the corresponding domain

2417
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:20,080
we also for the we also have this global

2418
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:21,679
return id

2419
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:22,719
so this

2420
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:25,520
so this is the global waiting id

2421
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,159
is a global value

2422
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:30,480
for spanning multiple domain

2423
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:34,560
it can be mapped to a local vtm

2424
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:37,199
in a corresponding domain

2425
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:40,400
and also for the 5g we have this end to

2426
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:44,719
end network slice id as an iss ai

2427
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:48,560
in the previous the presentation uh the

2428
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:51,119
interworking uh between the

2429
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:54,000
5g network slides and the ietf network

2430
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,119
slice

2431
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:58,639
you can use the existing encapsulation

2432
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:01,040
such as the villa

2433
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:02,320
et cetera

2434
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,199
here this introduces another method that

2435
01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:06,520
means this

2436
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:10,080
snssi can be directly carried

2437
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:13,199
from this luang to the ietf network

2438
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:17,840
slice then to the uh mobile car network

2439
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:21,119
okay so for this the ids so that's the

2440
01:39:21,119 --> 01:39:24,000
local waiting id is mandatory

2441
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,520
because this is the must be forwarded in

2442
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,040
the

2443
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,520
in each domain but for the global

2444
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:35,440
reading id and the 5g s and ssi for the

2445
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:38,080
spanning the different domain

2446
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:40,719
these ids are optional

2447
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:43,920
okay next slide

2448
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,520
okay i will uh here this is a

2449
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,400
requirement of the uh

2450
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:53,280
end to end the ietf network slicing

2451
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:56,560
so this is a data plane so that's the id

2452
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,400
will be carried

2453
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:01,440
can be carried in the data plane

2454
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:02,719
so that's the

2455
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:06,159
the meeting id is mandatory but for the

2456
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:07,199
other

2457
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:09,920
two ideas is optional

2458
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,840
accordingly so there's there's the

2459
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,800
corresponding the manager plane and the

2460
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,239
controlling the

2461
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:17,520
extension

2462
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,360
so that's used

2463
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:21,840
based on the network controller

2464
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:25,760
it can allocate these ids and also set

2465
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:28,000
up this the mapping entries

2466
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,600
between the

2467
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,000
global waiting id and the local retain

2468
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:32,960
id

2469
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,679
or user to set up this the mapping

2470
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:36,719
entries

2471
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:39,760
between the global waiting id and the

2472
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,040
5g

2473
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:44,239
under to under network slicer id and

2474
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:47,440
that's the ss ai

2475
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:51,000
okay next slides

2476
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,480
okay so here are these updates so this

2477
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,320
version is

2478
01:40:56,320 --> 01:41:00,080
was submitted in april this year so the

2479
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:01,760
updates of this

2480
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:04,159
there are one version so we refine the

2481
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:06,560
description of the weeping class as we

2482
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:09,840
tune in networks less realization

2483
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:12,560
and the new courses are added then

2484
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:15,520
there's some editorial change

2485
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:19,159
okay next slides

2486
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:20,560
okay

2487
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,239
so that's the

2488
01:41:22,239 --> 01:41:24,800
so here we still use this the uh

2489
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,600
realization terminology vpnplus and the

2490
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:30,880
vtm so that's the according

2491
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:34,080
we will align the terminology according

2492
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:36,080
to the draft consensus in the working

2493
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:36,880
group

2494
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:39,600
such as the network resource partition

2495
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,280
we will refer to this the new

2496
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:44,000
terminology

2497
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:46,639
then we also go on to that's the

2498
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:50,000
solicitor comments and refine the draft

2499
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,679
and also from our opponent so that's the

2500
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:57,360
concept is direct and clear so answer is

2501
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:59,760
almost stable so that's possible we

2502
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:02,800
would like to request for a guru

2503
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,880
working group adoption

2504
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:06,320
okay

2505
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,799
that's all

2506
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:12,840
we have time for

2507
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:17,520
question sorry carrick go ahead

2508
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:20,000
sorry the title drew my attention do we

2509
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,920
have a new framework for end-to-end

2510
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,400
network slicing oh sorry for network

2511
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,480
slicing

2512
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:29,600
is this a new framework

2513
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:30,639
a

2514
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:33,119
new framework i mean so that's the

2515
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:35,679
realization for the

2516
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:39,679
uh for the realization framework for the

2517
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:43,840
itah network slice

2518
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:46,159
for the scenario the spaniard multiple

2519
01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:48,559
to me

2520
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:52,560
i would have thought it would be covered

2521
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,080
by the

2522
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:57,040
the existing uh network slice framework

2523
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:59,760
or definitions draft

2524
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:02,080
but i mean i'll let the authors of or

2525
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:05,280
the editor to comment thanks

2526
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:06,239
okay

2527
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:08,000
that's just also my

2528
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,239
question on that dropped i mean that's

2529
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:11,600
the scope

2530
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,760
i'm not sure what's the boundary of that

2531
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:14,880
draft

2532
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:17,440
either kind of you seems can cover every

2533
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:20,719
possible new things proposed

2534
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:23,119
so i think it's a good action for the

2535
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:25,679
authors of this document to look to see

2536
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:27,920
what text

2537
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:30,560
they think is missing from the existing

2538
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,480
working group framework document

2539
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:33,920
and propose

2540
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,480
text additions there clearly some of the

2541
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,159
text doesn't belong there like the

2542
01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:40,239
applicability of vpn plus i mean that

2543
01:43:40,239 --> 01:43:42,560
could go in the vpn plus document

2544
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,280
uh but you know it's it's a rather short

2545
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:46,960
and thin document it would be good to

2546
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,600
just understand its applicability um you

2547
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:51,440
know how much of it could be

2548
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:53,600
taken and put into the framework rather

2549
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,360
than have a whole new standalone

2550
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:56,719
document

2551
01:43:56,719 --> 01:43:58,960
um so that's a request from the chair

2552
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:00,480
and we could probably take the response

2553
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,159
offline on the list

2554
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:03,840
if you don't mind thank you

2555
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:04,840
and with

2556
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:06,800
that uh

2557
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,880
is it fun are you one

2558
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:11,119
yeah i think yeah that's me

2559
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:14,000
um so this is not a slicing presentation

2560
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,080
um so i think i've gone past all the

2561
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:18,239
slicing presentations for the day

2562
01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:20,320
uh so this in this presentation we are

2563
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:23,199
introducing a data model draft for uh

2564
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:25,520
discussing topology filters

2565
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:27,280
uh the zero zero version for this was

2566
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:29,520
published before ietf111 but this is the

2567
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:31,600
first time that we are presenting it in

2568
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:33,280
a working group session uh i'm

2569
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:35,199
presenting this on behalf of

2570
01:44:35,199 --> 01:44:39,199
my co-authors tarek krakatian schiffing

2571
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:41,119
the topology filter construct was

2572
01:44:41,119 --> 01:44:42,960
originally defined as part of the slice

2573
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,719
policy model but given its generic

2574
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:47,280
applicability we decided to publish it

2575
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:50,080
as a separate standalone module

2576
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:52,320
as the name suggests topology filter is

2577
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:54,560
a filtering construct that can be

2578
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:55,679
applied

2579
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:58,400
on a native topology or an or

2580
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:01,280
on a predefined customized topology the

2581
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:03,920
result of this application is a filtered

2582
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:06,320
set of topological elements you could

2583
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,320
use the term filter topology for this as

2584
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:10,639
used in other documents

2585
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:12,960
as part of this document we are also

2586
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,400
introducing a construct called a

2587
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:17,760
topology filter set which is basically

2588
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:20,480
a union of

2589
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:23,679
topology filters that can be applied in

2590
01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:25,760
tandem on a topology

2591
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,280
and also as you would expect the data

2592
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:29,600
model introduced in this document is

2593
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,800
applicable both on a network element

2594
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:35,840
and on a controller

2595
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:38,000
this is a

2596
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,360
an illustration of the high-level model

2597
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,679
structure the data tree includes a list

2598
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:43,360
for topology filters and analysts for

2599
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:45,119
topology filter sets

2600
01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:46,719
the top level container that is being

2601
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:48,800
augmented here is the networks container

2602
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,960
from the itf network module

2603
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:52,400
the initial thought was to augment the

2604
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:55,119
routing container but it has been

2605
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:57,119
rightly pointed out i believe it was bo

2606
01:45:57,119 --> 01:45:59,360
who pointed that out that routing

2607
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:01,119
container is a network element only

2608
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:03,760
construct and um and that we need to

2609
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:06,159
augment a top level container that can

2610
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:07,119
exist

2611
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:08,880
uh say both on a network element as well

2612
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,719
as on a controller so that's what we

2613
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:13,520
have right now um

2614
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:16,239
so the next three slides um they talk

2615
01:46:16,239 --> 01:46:18,400
about topology filters container

2616
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:20,639
thank you

2617
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:22,800
uh okay let me run through i don't have

2618
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,080
many slides i'll just quickly run

2619
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:26,880
through and i'll take the question

2620
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:29,360
this is

2621
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:31,280
so

2622
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:33,520
the topology uh each topology filter

2623
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:35,679
entry in the list specifies a set of

2624
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:37,679
include any include all and exclude

2625
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:39,760
filtering rules that can be applied on

2626
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:41,280
either the native topology or a

2627
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,960
customized topology

2628
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:44,239
uh the

2629
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:46,239
the topology uh

2630
01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:48,560
each topology filter entry it may carry

2631
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:50,880
a reference to the topology on which the

2632
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,239
filtering rules

2633
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:55,040
need to be applied uh if there is no

2634
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:56,639
reference present then the filtering

2635
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:58,639
rules are to be applied on what

2636
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:00,960
constitutes uh your so-called native

2637
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:03,119
topology and as indicated here the

2638
01:47:03,119 --> 01:47:05,679
reference topology could be a predefined

2639
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:08,480
t topology rfc 8795

2640
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:09,840
topology

2641
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:14,719
and or a specific igp domain

2642
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:18,000
the topology filter entry allows you to

2643
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,639
also specify um a varied set of

2644
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:22,800
attributes as part of the include any

2645
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:25,199
include all and exclude constructs that

2646
01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:26,880
can be used as rules to filter the

2647
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:30,719
topology we have had some asks to add a

2648
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:32,239
few more attributes to the filtering

2649
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:33,679
rules and

2650
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:35,440
there was also an ask to

2651
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,199
include exclude all

2652
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:38,719
we would be looking to do that in the

2653
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:40,159
next revision

2654
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:42,159
if the entry does not carry any

2655
01:47:42,159 --> 01:47:44,639
filtering rules and only references

2656
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:46,560
a specific topology then

2657
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,320
the reference topology becomes your

2658
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,880
filter topology as is

2659
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,560
um

2660
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:55,520
the topology filter set construct uh it

2661
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:56,800
this comes into play when there is a

2662
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,719
need to create a union of multiple

2663
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:00,880
topology filters and as you can see here

2664
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:03,280
each topology filter set entry carries a

2665
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:07,119
list of topology filter references

2666
01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:08,239
um

2667
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:09,600
so this is still

2668
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,920
early days for the draft

2669
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:13,600
the authors do believe however that the

2670
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,040
document is sufficiently cooked to

2671
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:17,040
progress to the next stage but the ask

2672
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:19,360
for now uh to the working group is just

2673
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:20,800
to review the document and provide

2674
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:22,159
feedback

2675
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:26,559
um that's it i'll take questions soon

2676
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:31,520
am i hearable okay

2677
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:36,960
clear questions just to set context

2678
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:39,360
uh to compare and contrast with the

2679
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:41,440
existing work

2680
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:44,560
so you have routing filters

2681
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:48,320
lots of them in good routing models

2682
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:53,280
you have lots of flow filters in bgp

2683
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:56,400
and then you have this topology filter

2684
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:58,080
could you compare

2685
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:01,199
contrast and give me examples where each

2686
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:03,440
one fits thank you

2687
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:05,360
so the topology filter the mandate is

2688
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:06,719
very simple i mean

2689
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:08,880
the couple of use cases think of any

2690
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:10,639
computation profile

2691
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:13,040
today we do pass in a topology and say

2692
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:16,239
computer path within the topology but

2693
01:49:16,239 --> 01:49:18,080
say you have a customized topology and

2694
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:19,520
on top of that

2695
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:22,800
you want to do the computation only on a

2696
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:24,960
filtered set of elements

2697
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,840
you can apply a topology filter

2698
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:29,360
you uh

2699
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:31,840
the other use case which for which this

2700
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:34,000
was originally put together was

2701
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:34,800
like

2702
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,239
it was presented earlier with slice

2703
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:37,840
policy you

2704
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,840
if you have a network resource partition

2705
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,679
that has an associated filter topology

2706
01:49:41,679 --> 01:49:43,840
you need some way of saying this is

2707
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:45,599
these are the filtered set of

2708
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:47,440
topological elements on which

2709
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:50,159
uh your slice traffic needs to go

2710
01:49:50,159 --> 01:49:50,960
through

2711
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:53,119
so that that is

2712
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:57,760
with all deep respect for your expertise

2713
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,480
tell me why that

2714
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:03,199
isn't just repeating to me you've just

2715
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:05,520
done routing policy

2716
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:08,880
i i must be missing something because

2717
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:11,520
everything you've just said

2718
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:16,080
is equivalent to routing policy

2719
01:50:17,199 --> 01:50:20,080
if you can point me to a data model that

2720
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:22,400
mirrors what i've just explained where

2721
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,960
you can reference the topology and say

2722
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:27,280
uh filter it using so so and so

2723
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:29,520
filtering rules uh i i'd be happy to

2724
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:32,320
just refresh if you look at the body

2725
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:35,119
if you look at the body of bgp models

2726
01:50:35,119 --> 01:50:37,360
you will find they do that

2727
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:41,119
i think we're talking

2728
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,440
i thought i asked something that was a

2729
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:45,679
fairly simple question

2730
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:49,280
but unless you've

2731
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:53,760
unless you take up the bgp policy work

2732
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:55,040
and

2733
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:58,719
all of its ramifications which is

2734
01:50:58,719 --> 01:51:02,080
implemented here in other places

2735
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:05,199
it constrains routes if you're

2736
01:51:05,199 --> 01:51:08,880
constraining topologies of peers

2737
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:10,960
that's a different thing but i can't

2738
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:12,719
tell whether you're constraining

2739
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:14,719
topologies appears

2740
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:17,679
topologies of end nodes

2741
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:20,719
i really can't tell what this is

2742
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:23,199
doing and i thought i asked a simple

2743
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:26,400
question for understanding

2744
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,880
and i'm pointing you to several bodies

2745
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,719
of work so

2746
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:33,360
i'm confused fishner with the with the

2747
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:37,199
deepest of respect for your expertise

2748
01:51:37,199 --> 01:51:39,760
i will take a look at those uh

2749
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:42,159
references that you provided but uh the

2750
01:51:42,159 --> 01:51:44,880
last time i checked i couldn't find any

2751
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:46,080
uh

2752
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:47,280
any data

2753
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:49,599
construct that i could use to apply on

2754
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:53,760
an existing topology and get us uh

2755
01:51:54,719 --> 01:51:56,320
i'm

2756
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:59,119
i'm asking a very

2757
01:51:59,119 --> 01:52:02,400
um high-level question

2758
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:04,560
and my question then is what's your

2759
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:07,920
background on policy routing

2760
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,560
i i i'm i'm not trying to i'm not trying

2761
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:13,040
to be right

2762
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:16,159
that's what i'm thinking lou so i guess

2763
01:52:16,159 --> 01:52:18,320
i'll go away so

2764
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:20,000
yes

2765
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,679
what you're focused on

2766
01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:25,199
is about um uh routes

2767
01:52:25,199 --> 01:52:26,880
while what uh

2768
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,960
talking is focused on is topologies and

2769
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:30,719
maybe we should have some references on

2770
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:31,679
the list

2771
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:33,599
to show no lou

2772
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:36,719
that that is incorrect i am i am asking

2773
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:39,119
the high level question

2774
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:41,920
that says have you looked

2775
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:44,560
at the combination of work

2776
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,080
and it's

2777
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:47,199
and

2778
01:52:47,199 --> 01:52:49,599
yes i mean i i accept that

2779
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:51,599
you may not accept the answer

2780
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:53,679
but he said he answered that question by

2781
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:55,280
saying he looked at it and didn't think

2782
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:56,960
it was appropriate

2783
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:58,800
and so i'm happy to look at it and i

2784
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:01,360
guess i'll object that this i think is

2785
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:03,520
is missing a body of work and i guess

2786
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:05,040
the only thing that

2787
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,360
rather than getting an answer i can do

2788
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:09,440
is say thank you very much for

2789
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:11,599
entertaining my questions

2790
01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:14,080
and i object blue to the work thank you

2791
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:16,159
and this is and we can have we can

2792
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:18,400
continue the discussion on the uh on the

2793
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:21,199
web i'll raise it with my ad thank you

2794
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:22,400
very much

2795
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:23,840
um

2796
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:25,679
all right um with that unfortunately

2797
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:28,480
dhruv and loa we do not have time for

2798
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:30,719
your questions and the last presentation

2799
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:33,199
so i think we should move on and ask you

2800
01:53:33,199 --> 01:53:34,719
to take the question to the list

2801
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:36,320
apologize for

2802
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,880
uh the time management there

2803
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:41,840
okay

2804
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:49,599
okay

2805
01:53:49,599 --> 01:53:53,440
okay uh jamin from huawei this is a new

2806
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:56,159
topic the intent-based routine

2807
01:53:56,159 --> 01:53:59,440
okay next slide

2808
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:04,239
okay so here are these you the some this

2809
01:54:04,239 --> 01:54:06,400
is the introduction about the background

2810
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:09,840
in fact the seamless imprs sr has been

2811
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:11,280
proposed

2812
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:13,280
to describe the requirement for

2813
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:14,639
end-to-end

2814
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:17,040
intend-based paths spanning multiple

2815
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:19,360
domain networks

2816
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:22,639
and corresponding the protocol extension

2817
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:25,760
of the bdp has been proposed

2818
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:28,320
but we know that the

2819
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:31,199
because our seamless mpsr

2820
01:54:31,199 --> 01:54:34,400
the this inter-domain sr path needs to

2821
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:38,080
set up according to the pair a color and

2822
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:39,440
a point

2823
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:40,880
that means

2824
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:44,560
more sr paths need to be introduced

2825
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:46,719
in multiple domains

2826
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:49,360
so that this will cause more challenges

2827
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:51,520
on scalability

2828
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,159
so in order to reduce the scalability

2829
01:54:54,159 --> 01:54:56,560
challenge introduced by the intel domain

2830
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:58,000
routine

2831
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,119
so that's this document uh proposed

2832
01:55:01,119 --> 01:55:03,280
intended-based routine

2833
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:04,800
mechanism

2834
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:07,199
that means that's the

2835
01:55:07,199 --> 01:55:09,840
the intended information can be carried

2836
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:11,760
in the data plane

2837
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:14,719
so the network nodes considering the

2838
01:55:14,719 --> 01:55:16,080
packet

2839
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:18,880
into the sr policy or the

2840
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:21,920
underlying network slides to satisfy the

2841
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:24,000
service requirement

2842
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
uh so that's

2843
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,080
the service requirement

2844
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:30,880
means the specific intent

2845
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:33,920
okay next slice

2846
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:38,719
okay so here this is the

2847
01:55:38,719 --> 01:55:41,760
uh some the introduction of the concept

2848
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:44,639
so this first is the color so that's the

2849
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:47,119
color is used

2850
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:49,040
is defined in the

2851
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:51,360
segmented routine policy so there's a

2852
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:53,599
color is used

2853
01:55:53,599 --> 01:55:54,639
is a

2854
01:55:54,639 --> 01:55:58,560
22-bit numeric value that associated the

2855
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:01,280
sr policy with the intent

2856
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:03,840
so means that's the for example the

2857
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:07,679
color means this low latency

2858
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:10,639
that's for the sr policy

2859
01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:13,520
okay under the entrance

2860
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:16,719
this is a new concept introduced by the

2861
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:20,000
intent based routine mechanism so this

2862
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,320
is the intrinsic information

2863
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:23,119
is

2864
01:56:23,119 --> 01:56:25,920
carried in the data plane these are

2865
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:28,239
different from the color that means

2866
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:30,719
associated to the sr policy

2867
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:32,560
in the control plane

2868
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:35,440
so that's used because they both of

2869
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:38,159
color and the intent can represent some

2870
01:56:38,159 --> 01:56:39,440
of these the

2871
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:40,880
intent

2872
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:44,080
information so there's a can be mapping

2873
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:47,119
between the intent and the color so here

2874
01:56:47,119 --> 01:56:49,040
this is the figure to show that the

2875
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:52,400
intended x can be mapped to the color y

2876
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:54,840
if there has the same meaning or

2877
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:57,280
specific intent

2878
01:56:57,280 --> 01:57:00,080
besides this mapping because the color

2879
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:03,040
is always used for the sr policy

2880
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:04,960
for the steering traffic

2881
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:05,840
uh

2882
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:09,760
the enchanter is not confined to the

2883
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:12,639
color it can be used for other purposes

2884
01:57:12,639 --> 01:57:14,719
such as the network environment and the

2885
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:19,440
security etc okay next slides

2886
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:23,280
okay so here we can see that the

2887
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:25,760
further

2888
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:27,199
for the

2889
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:28,239
inter

2890
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:29,280
domain

2891
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:32,880
network so that's the for the

2892
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,960
uh for the network node

2893
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:38,400
uh at the edge of the youtube network

2894
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:42,480
domain the sr policy group can be set up

2895
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:44,639
the sr policy group

2896
01:57:44,639 --> 01:57:47,040
includes the mapping between the colors

2897
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:50,239
and the sr policy was specific in the

2898
01:57:50,239 --> 01:57:51,119
point

2899
01:57:51,119 --> 01:57:54,080
so when the package arrived at the edge

2900
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:56,960
of the network domain it can according

2901
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:57,920
to

2902
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:00,639
the destination address in the packet

2903
01:58:00,639 --> 01:58:03,119
to search the sr

2904
01:58:03,119 --> 01:58:05,360
policy group

2905
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:07,840
that for the underpoints

2906
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:09,840
then according to the intended

2907
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:12,480
information in the packet map to the

2908
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,880
color and according to the

2909
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:17,199
mapping between the color and the policy

2910
01:58:17,199 --> 01:58:18,480
to search

2911
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:22,159
uh get get to the sr policy so that's a

2912
01:58:22,159 --> 01:58:24,880
considering the packet

2913
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:28,000
into the corresponding sr policy to

2914
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,920
satisfy the

2915
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:31,440
entrant

2916
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:35,080
okay next slice

2917
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:38,080
okay so here this is the color used for

2918
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:40,560
the underlay network slice

2919
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:43,119
so that's the same the color

2920
01:58:43,119 --> 01:58:44,719
mapping

2921
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:47,040
the the mapping between color and the

2922
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,920
local underlay network slides can be set

2923
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:52,480
up in the data plane when the package

2924
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:54,639
arrived based on the intended

2925
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:56,239
information in the

2926
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:58,719
packet it can be mapped to the

2927
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:01,679
corresponding color then corresponding

2928
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:04,159
to the net corresponding underlying

2929
01:59:04,159 --> 01:59:07,040
network slides so then we can steering

2930
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:08,320
the traffic

2931
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:09,760
uh into the

2932
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:10,639
uh

2933
01:59:10,639 --> 01:59:13,840
underlay network slides to satisfy the

2934
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:15,119
intent

2935
01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:18,159
okay next slides

2936
01:59:19,599 --> 01:59:21,599
okay so there's the some of the

2937
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:24,880
advantages so this is the scalability so

2938
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:26,960
this is the mapping between the intent

2939
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:30,400
and the sr policy can be done locally

2940
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:32,960
without the need of other word has the

2941
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:35,920
label binding for the pair color and the

2942
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:39,679
point to studied stitch the sr post

2943
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:42,480
path in different local domains

2944
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:45,119
a second that's the use of flexibility

2945
01:59:45,119 --> 01:59:48,000
because the intent can be satisfied by

2946
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,880
the different solutions for example the

2947
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:53,199
internet can be satisfied by the sr

2948
01:59:53,199 --> 01:59:56,080
policy or the underlying network slides

2949
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:59,280
so for spanning multiple domain so the

2950
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:01,599
one domain can use the sr policy for

2951
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:04,080
that intent another domain can use the

2952
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:06,880
underlying network slides for the intent

2953
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:10,320
so that we can flexibly to combine these

2954
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:11,840
solutions

2955
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:15,840
for the same intent so this is

2956
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:19,360
achieve the advantage of flexibility

2957
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:22,360
lasso

2958
02:00:46,159 --> 02:00:48,719
robin i've lost audio i'm not sure if

2959
02:00:48,719 --> 02:00:51,679
everyone else has i think we lost robin

2960
02:00:51,679 --> 02:00:52,880
um

2961
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:56,000
i think we are at the top of the

2962
02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:59,760
yeah i mean this is uh interesting new

2963
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:02,800
work um i'm not 100 sure it belongs in

2964
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:06,159
teas and um unfortunately that was i was

2965
02:01:06,159 --> 02:01:07,119
going to

2966
02:01:07,119 --> 02:01:08,960
ask that as a presenter i'll have to

2967
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:12,000
take the comment to the to the list

2968
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,320
um we're we are pretty much out of time

2969
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:16,080
i see laura you just joined the queue go

2970
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:18,320
ahead

2971
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:20,880
i just wanted to say that i think that

2972
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:23,040
this for the time being it actually

2973
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:25,679
belongs guarantees

2974
02:01:25,679 --> 02:01:29,199
it has a strong traffic engineering

2975
02:01:29,199 --> 02:01:33,040
uh possibility i think

2976
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:35,599
um i i think we're okay with it being

2977
02:01:35,599 --> 02:01:37,440
here for now but we'll continue to track

2978
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:39,760
and coordinate with the ad

2979
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:43,360
um uh we are you know so it's early work

2980
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:45,119
so i'd like to hear more about it and

2981
02:01:45,119 --> 02:01:47,280
see more discussed on the list

2982
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,040
okay sure thanks

2983
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:51,440
yeah no thank you for the comment um uh

2984
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:53,840
given where we are on time we should uh

2985
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:55,040
wrap up

2986
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:57,360
uh pavand is anything you want to add

2987
02:01:57,360 --> 02:02:00,639
before we close or even close

2988
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:02,719
no um yes

2989
02:02:02,719 --> 02:02:04,800
we had a great meeting thanks to adrian

2990
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:06,320
for uh

2991
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:08,800
all the time that he put in uh yeah we

2992
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:10,400
did ask for extra time and i think we

2993
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:11,840
managed to fill it in

2994
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:14,000
uh yeah thanks everyone see you next

2995
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,159
time

2996
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:20,760
thanks everyone bye

2997
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,080
you
