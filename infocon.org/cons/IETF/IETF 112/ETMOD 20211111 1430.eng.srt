17
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,930

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,680
[Music]

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,199
what the presenter saying that's on the

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,079

um

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,720
we're well into the ietf this week so i

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,799
think folks will be fairly familiar with

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,080
our notewell we have a set of documents

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,040
and pcps that govern how we

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,600
uh interact how we operate

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,360
that covers

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,159
both

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,159
technology disclosures patents ipr

31
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,560
as well as code of conduct

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,479
please keep in mind that everything we

33
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,000
say and do here becomes part of our

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,880
public record we are uh recording this

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,920
session and though this session will be

36
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,880
made available uh via youtube as well as

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,920
other

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,040
ietf memes

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,479
one of these

40
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,960
pcps is our

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,520
conduct guidelines it's bcp54 we've been

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,520
asked by our leadership to highlight

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,399
this

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,759
and

45
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,439
you know that this has always been there

46
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,479
uh bcp54 but there's been some recent

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,640
discussions and we think it's uh we

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,960
think they think it's very important to

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,200
ensure that we keep our

50
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,079
um interactions very respectful and

51
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,119
courteous and collegiate

52
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,720
and

53
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,319
even if we're having heated discussions

54
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,000
which is also just fine to have

55
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,080
discussions which you are maybe a little

56
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,760
passionate about but please keep it

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,560
technical and uh always respectful

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,360
uh we're using medeco

59
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,560
if you are listening you you found us

60
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,400
and as i mentioned we're going to

61
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,319
make a video recording of this so you

62
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,319
might be seeing this on video

63
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,080
the note taking we've mentioned before

64
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,879
it's the collaborative uh i've seen uh

65
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,200
one person join since i asked

66
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,400

the note taking page and and help us

71
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,120

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,720
important that we um capture actions and

73
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,239
and the good discussion

74
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,480
just quickly add um also the link at the

75
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,319
very top of the meat echo window the

76
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,400
fourth icon from the left on the in the

77
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,360
top uh right corner is taking the

78
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,599
notetaker tool as well

79
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,360
thank you

80
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,800
and that was kent for those of you that

81
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,319
don't know

82
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,360
the agenda is basically as published

83
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,440
we've had some i think we had a speaker

84
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,400
update and some versions update uh but

85
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,120
the

86
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,000
the agenda is largely unchanged

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,480
again all the material is posted

88
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,200
we think this session is going to run so

89
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,720
tight that we're not going to get to the

90
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,640
last

91
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,840
slot

92
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,319
this slot is actually coming to us from

93
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,640
a c camp document

94
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,480
and i think the main question really

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,640
there was which working group does this

96
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,760
belong in

97
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,599
and generally

98
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,760
we follow the the practice in net mod as

99
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,360
if there is another working group that

100
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,599
has expertise on the material being

101
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,480
covered

102
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,000
uh by the model it should be done in

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,080
that working group so we would expect

104
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,840
this to continue and see this work to

105
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,879
continue in c camp um

106
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,159
as uh as is indicated by the draft name

107
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,160
we have not had any

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,839
rfcs published since the last time we

109
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,639
met

110
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,040
but we do have some items in the rfc

111
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,560
editor queue

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,080
i don't think there was anything

113
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,240
particularly noteworthy there to talk

114
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,639
about i'll defer to kent if he wants to

115
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,240
jump in with anything but i don't think

116
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,840
there was anything really noteworthy

117
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,720
there

118
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,919
um

119
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,360
the post-last call documents we have a

120
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,080
couple that are expired the authors are

121
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,000
have committed to doing that update so

122
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,199
these aren't dead even though they're

123
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,160
expired so we'll keep an eye on that

124
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,600
we do have one document that was

125
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
returned to the working group um

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,320
basically there was some uh alignment

127
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,880
necessary to reference documents the

128
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
action for that sits with the authors

129
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,400
and we really are hoping that the

130
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,000
authors um

131
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,680
uh take initiative

132
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,320
there uh if they don't if there's others

133
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,800
who wish to

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,720
help out i would suggest that they

135
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,880
contact the authors as well as cc the

136
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,120
netmod chairs and we can we can discuss

137
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,160
that

138
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,199
we have several uh documents

139
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,360
not on the agenda

140
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,240
um no tags has

141
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
hasn't been modified in a while there

142
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,680
has been an update on the list a couple

143
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,639
of times uh so we're really looking um

144
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,880
for an update there

145
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,680
the next one the the

146
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,120
uh we there was some recent good

147
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,680
discussion about whether to take that to

148
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,880
um

149
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,280
last call as is or wait for addition

150
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,800
additional changes

151
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,680
uh

152
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,440
we we think that it would be

153
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,320
um

154
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,800
fine to move this forward if there isn't

155
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,520
something immediate that would that had

156
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,800
been identified by the working group

157
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,600
that should be added so please take a

158
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,680
look at this document if you think you

159
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,120
have something you want to add to it

160
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,600
please propose it on the list

161
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,360
if we don't see anything

162
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,520
probably sometime in december we'll take

163
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,318
it to last call

164
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,960
versioning requirements uh that document

165
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,440
is pretty well uh complete we're just

166
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,120
waiting for the other versioning work to

167
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,319
it to advance it

168
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,479
we haven't had any recent incoming

169
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,960
or outgoing liaisons proposed

170
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,919

171
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,800

172
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,440
please let us know um and the best way

173
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,560
to do that is on the list

174
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,440
um yeah that's sort of the first point

175
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,520
here is utilize the list that's where we

176
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,360
do consensus these discussions are good

177
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,800
the interims are good they're very

178
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,520
important for helping us make progress

179
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,000
but decision making happens on on the

180
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,039
list

181
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,560
this is particularly important when you

182
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,599
have it

183
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,960
to keep in mind when you have an active

184
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,720
set of authors that are actively

185
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,840
discussing

186
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,400
changes um they may to agree to a set of

187
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,599
changes but

188
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,599
if it's a working group document the

189
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,960
acceptance of those changes is governed

190
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,280
by the working group not the authors so

191
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,880
those that it's great to have that

192
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
progress but the this the discussion has

193
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,240
to be reflected on the list then we have

194
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,599
to get buy-in from the working group

195
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,120
there

196
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,720
we continue to

197
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,080
support and offer um informal meetings

198
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,360
that we can

199
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,680
that the chairs can support

200
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,599
uh that through scheduling working group

201
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,919
web access we also can have virtual

202
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,960
interims like we did uh last month and

203
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,360
all that takes again is a request to the

204
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,680
uh authors

205
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,039
um

206
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,120
uh or sorry request from uh to the

207
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,919
the chairs

208
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,599
with that we're going to move to the

209
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,000
next presentation

210
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,720
i believe that's bellage bellage

211
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,440
up on the top there should be a share

212
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,840
preloaded slide button if you could

213
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,680
click that you should be able to find

214
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,759
your shot your slides and present

215
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,720
okay

216
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,280
i think you were down at the bottom

217
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,759
listed as zero two i don't know we can't

218
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,840
reorder but

219
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,240
their number they are numbered if my

220
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,160
screen says a new deck is being shared

221
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,840
but i don't but there it is here we go

222

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,000
network network versioning

228
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,240
group

229
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,120
on the versioning agenda

230
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,000
i will present a short overview

231
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,839
of what we are doing and then we put

232
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,839
more time for into

233
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,760
what's happening into yank packages

234
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,760
we are still having weekly

235
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760

we are

244
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,160
doing these days is we have the first

245
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,720
two drafts the module versioning and the

246
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,240
yanks amber drafts we try to finish that

247
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,880
and

248
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,880
push them to work group last call

249
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,080
so

250
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,040
and then we are beside this we are also

251
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,680
working on the package drafts

252
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,920
or package draft there are a number of

253
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,640
open issues we have an issue tracker on

254
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,560
the idea website

255
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,760
we are trying to close that

256
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,640
and re

257
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,440
solve all the issues

258
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,320
so what updates we have been doing we

259
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,480
had are at dash 05 at this point

260
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,920
that was released last days

261
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,000
for the module versioning basically it's

262
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,480
editorial updates

263
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,560
and adding a few

264
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,279
small statements correcting

265
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,160
uh

266
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,279
some of the

267
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,800
examples

268
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,000
and

269
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,360
that not nothing new

270
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,839
major com functional happened here

271
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,760
for the stemware

272
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,040
this which

273
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,240
defines our versioning

274
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,519
labeling

275
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,560
method

276
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,959
we have a bit more work we had the full

277
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,440
reviews by the authors corrected

278
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,399
everything we found

279
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,079
we defined how this is usable for sub

280
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,279
modules

281
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,600
text previously referred to modules

282
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,839
we've changed the prefix to make it

283
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,240
shorter and and unique

284
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,200
uh in the in our yang module

285
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,480
and then there were a number of

286
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,680
editorial changes

287
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,839
yeah

288
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,880
for sub modules the basic statement is

289
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,240
that

290
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
they can this they can be versioned

291
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,440
using

292
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,839
yank semantic versioning

293
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,760
if you change

294
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,200
the the sub module and you change the

295
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,440
semantic versioning of the sub module

296
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,760
then you also have to change the modules

297
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,560
semantic version similar as what we have

298
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,560
with revision information dates so if

299
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,640
you change the sub module then that

300
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,319
means the module is also changed

301
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,959
next steps what we are still working on

302
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,519
we have the tracker for the first two

303
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,240
modules module versioning and some um

304
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,440
semantic versioning the issues are

305
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,639
closed

306
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,360
we

307
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,600
believe we found a solution for every of

308
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,200
those issues

309
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,000
and the authors believe that

310
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,639
these two first drafts are ready for

311
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,360
work group last call so

312
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,800
we call on the chairs to decide please

313
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,120
and we are focusing on the packages

314
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,160
draft without the all the number of

315
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,079
issues and number of people are

316
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,240
contributing text and we'll have a bit

317
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,920
more uh

318
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,319
presentation on what is happening there

319
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,839
and with that i'm open to questions or i

320
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,720
would

321
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,000
hand over

322
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,240
to my colleagues to speak about what's

323
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,360
happening in packages

324
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,959
not a question but comment um just as a

325
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,360
recap the uh the plan for the working

326
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,680
group is that we will take these first

327
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,720
few

328
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,440
drafts to working group last call

329
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,000
but then the chairs will hold them

330
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,440
within the working group until the

331
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,480
entire set all five drafts are last

332
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,240
called and at which point we'll take

333
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,959
them uh to iesg

334
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,320
yes

335
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,920
and besides the meeting as the chair

339
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,680

uh as just

360
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,519
lash mentioned i'm going to present

361
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,320
young packages dropped status

362
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,800
on behalf of all the authors

363
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,760
and

364
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,279
and the

365
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,279
versioning netmode versioning team

366
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,320
uh

367
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,600
uh since last revision uh

368
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,959
we

369
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,160
we don't do

370
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,720
very uh major uh changes but we uh we

371
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,240
tried to uh

372
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,160
remove the package

373
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,600
uh check some definition since uh

374
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,639
mod

375
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,600
module versioning draft has uh removed

376
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,639
all the module versioning

377
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,639
module checksum

378
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,519
and

379
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,680
packages draft needs to

380
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,079
keep consistent with

381
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,079
all these checksum

382
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,079
issues so

383
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,600
that's the only changes we we do

384
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,279
to this uh

385
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,959
revision

386
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,440
uh regarding all the other uh open

387
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,320
issues right now um

388
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,519
we still have uh 20 open issues

389
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,959
and blush also mentioned that

390
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,880
all these issues

391
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,680
mostly issues has been assigned owners

392
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,040
so

393
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,560
the

394
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,519
contributors and working on that and to

395
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,440
move it forward

396
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,519
and here uh

397
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,959
we list the three issues uh we are

398
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,160
in that we are under discussion in the

399
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,320
weekly meeting

400
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,720
and

401
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,160
i'll

402
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,120
i uh took it each on this and

403
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,199
about uh issue 65 uh this is a quite

404
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,240
typical one that uh in in the open

405
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,680
issues that we need to refine the text

406
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,480
and

407
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,880
since young versioning drops has been

408
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,240
stable

409
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,360
and so this draft need to be

410
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,040
made the changes

411
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,000
this one is the

412
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,959
previous version young packages

413
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,480
uh definition

414
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,040
just use uh same word label but uh

415
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
we don't have a

416
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,759
samurai label scheme so

417
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,920
in in

418
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,199
so

419
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,959
right now we are uh

420
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,440
blasha working on this and to

421
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,240
uh

422
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,279
to

423
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,519
to

424
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,880
proposal text on it

425
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,439
and

426
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,319
about uh

427
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,559
some new function of these young

428
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,839
packages

429
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,439
is

430
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,160
scheme amount

431
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,119
right now uh in in this revision young

432
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,119
packages doesn't define

433
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,559
uh schema amount uh functions

434
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,440
um

435
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,240
so the question is

436
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,440
the authors

437
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,320
think the packages can contain modules

438
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,678
with module points

439
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,720
so

440
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,840
packages can give some

441
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,360
constraints on the

442
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,360
mount point so

443
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,640
for example

444
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,400
uh for itf uh basic

445
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,919
package

446
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,000
it means mount

447
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
layer 2 vpn or layer 3 vpn packages

448
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,200
so uh for young packages

449
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,799
then in the

450
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,799
on the mod

451
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,280
points we can list

452
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,639
some constraints whether

453
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,960
maybe only their three vpn needs uh

454
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,760
is

455
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,360
allowable uh package

456
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,799
so

457
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,039
to this uh issue with we think we will

458
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,440
update to include the mount point

459
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,960
information

460
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,240
and define some constraints for mounted

461
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,600
schema

462
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,240
here we list some rules

463
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,600
on this

464
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,280
like uh some package

465
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,720
package x

466
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,360
can constraints the

467
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,960
uh instance of one point to con to

468
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,080
restrict only layers two vpn earlier 3

469
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,039
vpn to be mounted

470
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,120
and

471
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,320
schema months listed in packet

472
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,840
is can be

473
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,039
override

474
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,280
of months in the included package

475
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,200
and

476
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,960
the rule

477
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
number three will be

478
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,679
a list of allowable packages

479
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,720
must include all allowable packages from

480
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,200
included packages

481
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,799
these

482
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,600
rules are

483
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,640
initial text

484
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,760
we are

485
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
proposing to add to

486
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,200
young packages

487
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,400
in the next revision

488
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,080
and one major issue is that uh

489
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,120
right now young packages also define

490
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,919
a model list

491
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,520
but jan

492
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,799
proposed this

493
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,240
issue that

494
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,679
he he

495
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,960
has some concerns on uh

496
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,240
there are already four mechanism

497
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,200
standardized by ietf

498
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,240
they are

499
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,400
hello message

500
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,520
net conf monitoring

501
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,760
young library

502
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,760
uh seventy

503
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,400
nine fifty um

504
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,760
mandates

505
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,679
in uh

506
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,240
one one one dot one is that young

507
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,620
library is mandatory and

508
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,919
[Music]

509
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:36,880
so

510
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,159
module list

511
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,799
is already there and also

512
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,039
we have uh

513
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,919
883 42

514
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,400
mmda young library so

515
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,480
young package will be the fifth

516
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,720
mechanism to list the set of modules

517
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,520
and so

518
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,200
right now yen is working on this to try

519
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,559
to propose some way to remove this

520
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,120
duplication so

521
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,080
right now the team are working on this

522
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,919
issue

523
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,640
but we need to further discuss

524
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,200
in the weekly meeting and then

525
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,559
when it

526
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,080
when

527
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,559
the authors think it's ready then we'll

528
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,120
bring back to the working group for

529
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,158
further discussion

530
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,200
so that's

531
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,240
almost uh the status

532
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,280
and progress we made and

533
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,679
and also the k issues

534
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,679
so next step

535
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,039
they als the team are working on the

536
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,919
open issues and try to

537
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:48,720
move

538
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,000
make more progress on this

539
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,120
so

540
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,840
that's the end of my presentation

541
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,000
thanks any questions and comments

542
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,320
uh thank you for the

543
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,480
hard work and

544
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,960
progress update as a reminder to the

545
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,919
working group uh anyone is welcome to

546
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,679
participate in it it's a working group

547
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,000
activity it's not an author's activity

548
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,600
um so

549
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,840
it's open to all um and

550
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,320
uh if you could just um

551
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,520
uh try to re-post or post what you think

552
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,080
weekly uh issues that are going to be

553
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,200
discussed

554
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,480
um

555
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,880
that'll help to identify help people to

556
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,400
identify when they should show up to

557
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,919
these meetings

558
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,159
um it's it's a request it's not a you

559
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,919
know if you don't do it we can live with

560
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,919
it but it'd be nice just to

561
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,159
give warning of what issues um you're

562
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,840
going to talk to talk about each week

563
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,760
just so that if someone's interested in

564
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,440
a particular issue they can show

565
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,799
uh thank you for the

566
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,440
the work and also uh thank you both for

567
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,120
uh ending early and keeping us on

568
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,439
schedule

569
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,080
indeed thank you

570
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,600
and next presentation is coupon

571
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,799
and if you're able to share your own

572
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,918
slides that'd be wonderful

573
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,639
can you see my slides

574
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,360
yes

575
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,720
okay

576
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,559
so hello everyone

577
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,080
this is chufong

578
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,000
on behalf of the authors and

579
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,480
contributors i would like to give a

580
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,840
presentation

581
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,120
about system defined configuration

582
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,080
as you can see it's a zero zero volume

583
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,000
draft but not really a new work

584
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,720
actually it has already been presented

585
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,559
in netcaf and

586
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,600
neta mode working groups for two times

587
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,960
and in last itf meeting it inspired a

588
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,120
lot of good discussion

589
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,480
so thank you jason blash rob and kent

590
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,640
for your valuable comments

591
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,080
and also

592
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,960
there was a lot of discussion on the

593
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
mailing list

594
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,679
it's more than

595
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,360
a 14 number a 40 number of messages

596
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,679
and about one month ago

597
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,240
a two hour network intern meeting was

598
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,000
held on this work

599
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,200
it's about 15 participants and i believe

600
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,080
that

601
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,880
we have reached a lot of agreement with

602
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,960
the objectives scope and solution

603
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,279
on this work

604
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,760
so a new draft has been proposed to

605
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,159
document the outcome in the internal

606
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,120
meeting

607
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,080
so the authors tried to rewrite the

608
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,200
previous confidence system dropped

609
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,679
and resubmitted as a nato model

610
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,440
individual draft based on chair

611
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,840
suggestion

612
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,080
so

613
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,919
yeah so regarding the motivation and

614
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:00,799
goal

615
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,919
there are four points which are actually

616
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,039
aligned with the objectives discussed in

617
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,960
the internal meeting if you can still

618
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,559
remember that

619
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,600
the visibility means that we want to

620
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,400
enable a server to better document the

621
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
system configuration

622
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,440
and convenient because it is often the

623
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,880
cases that

624
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,880
the client want to

625
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,960
the clients want to reference a system

626
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,520
configuration which is not visible in

627
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,320
running and we want to avoid at least

628
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,679
reduce heaven to copy the entire

629
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,080
contents of system configuration into

630
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,440
running when possible

631
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,200
configurable

632
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,400
is a capability of capability of being

633
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,679
configured

634
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,320
there may be a desire for clients to

635
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,720
configure descending nodes of system

636
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,720
defined configuration

637
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,919
and last one is the client control

638
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,480
we want the client to have control over

639
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,799
the configuration

640
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,880
which means a read back of running

641
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,919
should contain only what was explicitly

642
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,440
set by the clients

643
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,400
and

644
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,960
it was as it was discussed during the

645
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,320
intro meeting the complete solutions

646
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,799
consists of two parts

647
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,840
there is a mandatory with system

648
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,760
parameter which is used to retrieve

649
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
running and system configuration

650
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,279
combined

651
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,760
currently this parameter is defined as

652
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,520
an empty type

653
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,320
but we can discuss whether enumerated

654
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,200
values are needed for example

655
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,279
to control whether to return all the

656
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,760
system configuration or online system

657
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,360
configuration which are referenced

658
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,480
and both netcast get and get config

659
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,880
operation and the rest of

660
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,400
get and head methods are updated to

661
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,720
support this parameter

662
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,240
and the second part is that we can also

663
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,360
have an

664
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,240
option system data store which is read

665
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,400
only for clients

666
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,360
but its content may change dynamically

667
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,480
and our intention is to have no impact

668
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,360
to operational that is to say those

669
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,440
present in operation always

670
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,720
equal system will still be as obvious

671
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,840
this work doesn't change that behavior

672
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,000
and system defines those are

673
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,720
non-deletable but we do have some

674
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,399
system configuration which are

675
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,760
modifiable a client could define a new

676
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,640
value in running which will overwrite

677
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,440
that in system and it may also be

678
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,080
possible for a client to configure a

679
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,840
descendant node of system defined list

680
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,960
entry and the mod results will flow into

681
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,559
intended so

682
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,600
system

683
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,679
may be overwritten or extended by

684
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,360
running to create intended

685
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,000
so here gives a simple example of

686
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,200
configuring a descended node of a system

687
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,640
defined node

688
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,919
in this example suppose system provides

689
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,559
a loopback interface configuration with

690
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,960
a name and two ip addresses

691
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,399
and step step one and step to show that

692
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,080
the configuration

693
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,320
what the configuration looks like in

694
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,520
system and operational respectively

695
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,640
and in step three the client tries to

696
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,760
configure a description node which is a

697
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,240
descendant node of system defined

698
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,080
interface list node and after that

699
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,440
the configuration of loopback 0 shown in

700
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,840
operational includes the name

701
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,279
description and two ip addresses and the

702
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,760
original value of those explicitly

703
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,240
configured in running is intended

704
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,679
otherwise it equals system

705
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,399
i saw jason in the queue

706
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,200
so

707
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,559
do you like to

708
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,720
would like to say something about this

709
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,840
go ahead jason

710
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,360
jason

711
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,120
uh do you find that they should just

712
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,799
continue jason might be having issues

713
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,399
with his microphone

714
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,679
yeah okay

715
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,480
so uh

716
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,640
yeah i can't hear you

717
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,039
let me uh

718
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,200
apologies i i unmuted my own mic but not

719
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,240
in meat echo are you guys hearing me

720
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,520
yeah

721
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,559
okay i guess my question was about step

722
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,600
four

723
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,919
um and maybe this is still uh a point

724
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,559
we're debating in the draft but would

725
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,000
the origin there not be running

726
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,039
instead of intended

727
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,760
i believe that there is no running

728
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,799
a value named running in origin is only

729
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,799
intended which means

730
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,159
flow from

731
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,559
running data store okay

732
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,640
okay i may be misremembering the the

733
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,679
nmda uh origin then okay thanks

734
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,679
so there are some open issues some of

735
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,919
them may have already been discussed

736
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,440
during the interim and others may not

737
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,360
first there is a very

738
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,919
fundamental question whether we want

739
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,840
running osp valid

740
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,799
i know that both 7950 and 8342 define

741
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,600
that

742
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
running must always be a valid

743
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,520
configuration that tree

744
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,000
and i also know that there may be a

745
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,279
concern that if we allow running to be

746
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,480
invalid

747
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,880
then comes the issue of backward

748
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,799
compatibility

749
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,200
the offline validation for

750
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,919
legacy client will break unless all the

751
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,480
reference system configuration is copied

752
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,000
into running

753
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,720
but

754
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,919
there is also another view that if we

755
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,640
allow the reference system object

756
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,159
not in running for then for offline for

757
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,279
online validation the server can just

758
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,679
accept the system configuration that the

759
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,360
validation passes

760
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,399
and for offline validation there are

761
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:31,760
three ways

762
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,880
first one is that the client can

763
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,559
offline merge running into system but it

764
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,840
necessary client to be able to access

765
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,760
system data store

766
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,240
is easily achieved four mda clients

767
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,360
bundle solution for non-mdia clients

768
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,279
the second way is that clients

769
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,159
explicitly copy and paste reference

770
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,080
system configuration into running and we

771
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,960
know that copy and paste must already be

772
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,159
done when configuring descended nodes as

773
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,399
i mentioned before the client wants to

774
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,559
configure a description node for a

775
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,519
loopback the interface this node with a

776
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,279
key name is indeed is needed to copy and

777
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,159
paste

778
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,880
but the question is must it be done for

779
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,600
leaf reference 2

780
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,960
and the last way is that the clients use

781
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,120
always system parameter

782
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,760
to get a module view and then validate

783
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,480
against that merged view

784
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,760
but

785
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,039
it's debatable that if it's a real a

786
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,600
really offline validation because the

787
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,559
server must be online to respond that

788
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,120
request

789
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,600
and there are

790
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,480
other open issues something like should

791
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,320
we define an immutable flag which is

792
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,640
used to indicate to the clients which

793
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,519
system configuration is read only or

794
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,880
which is not

795
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,200
the server will return an error if the

796
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,279
clients attempt to

797
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,600
configure a value for a read-only system

798
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,960
configuration

799
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,760
but

800
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,240
what if configuring one with the same

801
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,799
value as found in system

802
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,519
is more like a copy and passed in this

803
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,919
case but should we allow it

804
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,159
and whether it's sufficient for this

805
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,120
immutable flag to be carried only when

806
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,240
the

807
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,640
the clients retrieve running with system

808
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,279
parameter

809
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,720
the the next issue is that

810
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,600
should with with origin parameter be

811
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,919
supported for intended

812
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,159
the server must remember whether a

813
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,159
specific data node

814
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,039
intended comes from system or running

815
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,760
but my question is should we expose this

816
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,640
origin information to the clients

817
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,519
and should the origin

818
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,480
ecosystem be required for system

819
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,039
configuration copied and tested into

820
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,080
running

821
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,679
currently it's more like a explicit with

822
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,599
default basic mode

823
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,440
and in default data nodes explicitly set

824
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,679
by a client will no longer be

825
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,399
treated as a default data even with a

826
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,000
same value but

827
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,320
always already equal to intended seems

828
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,879
more like and overwrite rather than copy

829
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,440
and paste

830
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,320
yeah go ahead jason please

831
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,399
hi guys uh just making sure you're

832
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,040
hearing me again

833
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,000
hello

834
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,719
thank you jason you'll see that the mic

835
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,359
goes up and down

836
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,040
don't wait for acknowledgement please

837
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,280
okay um so

838
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,000
the

839
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,040
um

840
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,359
for the last bullet here

841
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,639
um

842
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,520
i i would i'd propose that if

843
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,839
if uh if like an interface has been

844
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,480
defined purely by system

845
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,440
then the origin should say system but if

846
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,200
if the

847
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,560
user or client has explicitly

848
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,680
declared that interface in the running

849
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,800
config

850
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,720
then i think that should be reflected as

851
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,119
a different origin somehow

852
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,800
so either intended or or some other

853
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,160
whatever the same origin is for

854
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,320
explicitly defined config

855
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,800
to show that that's been kind of you

856
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,520
know explicitly entered into the

857
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,760
running configuration and because we're

858
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,160
kind of taking the stance that overrides

859
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,760
and takes precedence

860
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,440
over um

861
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,839
the system

862
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,440
configuration and that

863
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,560
my second

864
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,599
um

865
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,680
comment which is kind of related to the

866
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,359
origin is um

867
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,839
i mentioned i guess i asked earlier in

868
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,680
the example where the origin should be

869
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,520
shown as intended

870
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,560
um

871
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,400
i checked nmda and you're right it

872
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,480
doesn't seem to be a running but

873
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,599
there's going to be a little bit of

874
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,079
confusion i think because

875
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,880
system merges into intended

876
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,119
so when we give an origin of intended um

877
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,800
it's it could it could be a little

878
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
ambiguous as to whether

879
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,040
that actually came from system or from

880
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,720
running i mean i know we have an origin

881
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,640
of system but

882
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,000
we may want to have some more discussion

883
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,839
about about those origins

884
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,599
hi this is kent as a contributor oh i'm

885
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,960
sorry

886
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,760
yeah

887
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,760
go ahead please

888
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,680
yeah you can't go ahead uh yeah thank

889
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,160
you yeah i just want to respond to um

890
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,560
jason's comment actually both comments

891
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,839
um

892
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,119
so

893
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:47,839
the

894
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,920
um

895
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,880
for the origin equal system uh when when

896
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,200
copy pasted into running i think the

897
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
idea is that

898
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,079
uh

899
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,720
you know all the ancestor nodes uh or

900
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,520
really everything that got copied would

901
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,960
initially have

902
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,760
the

903
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,680
origin equal system

904
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,240
but then if descendant nodes were being

905
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,520
configured

906
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,079
then those would be the ones that would

907
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,760
um

908
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,400
have the origin equals intended

909
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,200
and then but then to your second point

910
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,960
and actually the middle bullet point on

911
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,079
this slide

912
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,240
i think the intention there is whether

913
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,359
or not

914
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,240
this work should introduce

915
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,040
to the intended data store

916
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,520
like with the operational data store

917
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,720
inability to uh you know when you get

918
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,800
the configuration from intended you

919
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,040
could actually specify a with with

920
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,560
origin parameter

921
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,800
that would then annotate those values so

922
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,240
that even when you're getting from

923
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,480
intended it would be visible as to

924
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,240
whether or not those values came from

925
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,440
system or

926
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,359
from running uh currently of course

927
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,160
that's not a bill that nmda didn't allow

928
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,920
for that it only allowed for the with

929
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,560
origin to the operational data store

930
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,839
that's all

931
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,359
yeah the

932
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,720
the server must remember whether uh a

933
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,480
data node intended it comes from system

934
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,680
or from

935
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,280
running so

936
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,839
so that you can make sure that this it

937
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,520
will have no impact to operational those

938
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,240
those will previously present in

939
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,880
operational with origin ecosystem will

940
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,720
still ecosystem

941
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,720
and so that but

942
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,880
this question is should we

943
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,520
define this already information to the

944
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,920
clients so that can retrieve from

945
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,920
intended

946
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,640
so the third bullet

947
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,760
for us a

948
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,280
very common use case is that people do a

949
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,839
show all configuration

950
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,320
store it somewhere and then replace the

951
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,119
full configuration back

952
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,480
now in the such case you need the origin

953
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,119
equal system markings to be able to say

954
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,240
that yes but the origin

955
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,079
marked nodes i don't we don't have to

956
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,040
push back if we would lose that because

957
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,760
it's not there anymore then we try to

958
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,320
override them and that leads to problems

959
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,320
so yes for the

960
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,200
bullet definitely

961
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,960
thank you yeah okay thank you

962
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,480
go ahead jason

963
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,440
um

964
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,000
i guess responding both to to kent and

965
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
abelash um so balash if

966
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,599
if someone um

967
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,000
does a read back from intended or

968
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,280
operational

969
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,960
and they have not

970
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,920
explicitly declared system configuration

971
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,359
in the running

972
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,839
then it would it would report those

973
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,760
system configuration items as origin

974
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,960
system

975
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,160
i'm only advocating that if an operator

976
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,000
explicitly

977
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,760
declares

978
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,000
system configuration themselves in the

979
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,119
running

980
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,880
that it should be considered with an

981
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,040
origin the same as any other

982
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,599
config that the client does in running

983
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,280
i think it would be odd that you could

984
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,880
read the running

985
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,160
uh see certain statements in there then

986
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,880
you read uh operational

987
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,040
and some of the statements from running

988
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,319
have a different origin than other

989
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:31,680
statements in running

990
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,640
so

991
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,040
i'm i'm still of the opinion that

992
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,640
anything you

993
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,359
kind of um anything you declare and

994
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,960
running

995
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,200
that overrides system

996
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,000
in my opinion that that is considered

997
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,359
just like any other client config

998
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,839
and would should be reported as that as

999
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,520
that origin

1000
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,480
um

1001
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,200
when

1002
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,520
when a client declares something

1003
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,880
in the running

1004
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,920
in order to make offline validation work

1005
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,079
they don't have to copy the entire

1006
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,720
object and all its descendant leafs

1007
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,480
they just have to copy

1008
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,839
basically the the list entry and its key

1009
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,400
to resolve the leaf ref to make it opera

1010
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,680
to make it

1011
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,640
valid

1012
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,200
all the rest of the descendant

1013
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,280
nodes in that object for example that

1014
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,599
interface could stay declared by system

1015
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,880
they don't have to be copied into

1016
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,880
running

1017
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,119
go ahead john

1018
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,400
thank you

1019
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,800
yeah my main concern here is that uh we

1020
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,560
are redefining 7950 and 83 42

1021
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,839
and in a sort of highly incompatible way

1022
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,920
and i'm not very favorable with that but

1023
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,680
i agree very much with the intents of

1024
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,680
this work i think system config is

1025
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,200
important that we can do things there

1026
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,760
but maybe we should try to reverse the

1027
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,560
the flags like with system should maybe

1028
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,960
perhaps be without system instead so

1029
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,560
that if you don't specify any flag

1030
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,560
everything works as normal and then if

1031
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,800
you're if your client is capable of

1032
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,359
seeing things that are well sort of

1033
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:14,720
leaf threats pointing to things that

1034
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,880
don't exist in running and then you

1035
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,040
specify this without system and then you

1036
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,640
can deal with that so i just want

1037
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,160
everything to work as normal as long as

1038
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,680
you don't specify anything special

1039
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:28,960
contributor

1040
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,400
so first i think actually the width

1041
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,240
system gives you the normal behavior by

1042
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,560
default but we should double check that

1043
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,760
um to jason's point uh the comment of

1044
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,680
the in parenthesis at the bottom of that

1045
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,760
previous slide is said much like the

1046
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,319
default flag in um the with defaults rfc

1047
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,880
in the sense that uh for those servers

1048
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,040
that had the explicit mode

1049
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,119
um you know the default flag is there so

1050
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,000
that the server can know for sure that

1051
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,720
like the client was configuring back

1052
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,839
into running

1053
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,640
the default value if the client negated

1054
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,960
or neglected to specify the default

1055
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,520
annotation then the server would say oh

1056
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,040
even though this value is the same value

1057
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,960
as the default the server is explicitly

1058
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,720
configuring it so that exact same

1059
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,000
behavior i think is what we'd want to

1060
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,420
carry over into this system uh idea um

1061
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,440
[Music]

1062
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,480
maybe we need to have something like um

1063
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,400
system modes if there's you know with

1064
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,760
default modes maybe there's like with

1065
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,760
system modes and so the server can

1066
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,160
advertise its behavior in that regard

1067
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,000
uh and then sorry my second point is

1068
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,720
is that uh actually i think uh the first

1069
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,200
open issue which is the on screen now is

1070
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,440
probably the more important one

1071
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,359
to be focusing on is the extent of

1072
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,200
backwards compatibility

1073
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,079
uh

1074
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,079
and right now i think this work is

1075
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,880
teetering on needing something like yang

1076
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,440
next or neck of next rest comp next

1077
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,839
would you know do or or if you know we

1078
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,680
could structure in one way that it

1079
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,000
doesn't uh you know because it could be

1080
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,319
the case that a legacy client a client

1081
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,400
that's not aware of the ability to

1082
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,839
process system information will be

1083
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,079
suddenly very surprised if it you know

1084
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,480
does i get um

1085
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,200
on running and it and some extra

1086
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,000
annotations appear uh such as the origin

1087
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,880
equal system uh by default um they may

1088
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,560
not know how to process that so i i

1089
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,599
guess we just have to work through that

1090
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,119
detail

1091
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,800
yeah and we'll have to take more

1092
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,720
discussion at least on this on to the

1093
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,240
list if you could wrap up your

1094
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,440
presentation so that we have time for

1095
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,480
the next slot please

1096
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,040
yeah there is i i believe

1097
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,200
uh we have already

1098
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,920
discussed the issues all and i have

1099
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,480
already wrapped up

1100
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,520
i'm happy to ship the issues to the list

1101
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,680
yeah yes please uh really good

1102
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,920
discussion i'd like to continue if we

1103
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,680
get enough intensity and interest we can

1104
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,280
always hold a uh

1105
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,800
another interim

1106
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,400
and with that uh moving on okay thank

1107
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,400
you

1108
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,720
uh oscar can you uh

1109
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,839
there you go

1110
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,040
and let me see

1111
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,680
ah sure

1112
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,400
yeah that's good thank you continue

1113
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,920
oh

1114
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,720
okay i hope that you can hear me

1115
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,280
good so thank you very much for giving

1116
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,240
us the opportunity to present this this

1117
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,040
work on the extensions of the acls

1118
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,520
okay so here we are on behalf of my

1119
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,079
co-authors also from from telefonica and

1120
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,400
from i'm from orange

1121
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,319
so the

1122
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:51,760
the idea

1123
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,000
the idea of the or the motivation of

1124
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,240
this draft is that we took as a starting

1125
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,119
point

1126
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,079
the acl young model that is defined in

1127
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,200
net mode precisely in 8519

1128
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,079
and

1129
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,040
that

1130
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,240
that young model targets the

1131
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,160
configuration of the forwarding behavior

1132
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,160
in a device okay so you can create this

1133
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,800
these filters okay so this model you can

1134
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,640
create

1135
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,599
the entries so this acas the matches and

1136
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,440
the actions okay so

1137
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,720
to that point everything so good so far

1138
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,119
and we have been

1139
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,280
doing some work internally in the in

1140
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,640
both in telephonic and audience

1141
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,760
compiling the operational experiences of

1142
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,440
of the use of the

1143
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,319
of the acls in the deployments and

1144
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,160
trying to see if we can

1145
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,160
do everything using this

1146
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,599
this young model

1147
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:42,560
and

1148
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,640
we have documented here in the in the

1149
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,400
trap that we are presenting a set of

1150
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,000
improvements that

1151
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,560
that we think are necessary

1152
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,760
to the acl model okay and what we would

1153
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,079
like today as we'll see at the end is to

1154
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,480
discuss with you the approach of doing

1155
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,599
those

1156
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:02,800
those extensions so the

1157
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,480
current young module defined in the in

1158
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,839
rfc8519 is prepared it's already

1159
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,760
prepared to have some augmentations okay

1160
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,760
so it's been prepared to be

1161
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,880
to be extended however because of

1162
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,040
its design there are set of limitations

1163
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,720
that

1164
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,200
it makes it complicated to

1165
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,000
do all the improvements via augmentation

1166
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,280
okay so

1167
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,240
in order to do some of the

1168
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,640
improvements we will need to do some

1169
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,040
redefinition of the of some things

1170
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,640
so here is the

1171
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,240
the list of the

1172
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,400
or the functional of this this

1173
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,400
enhancement and functional gaps

1174
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,520
uh and classified by what is the the

1175
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,359
problematic that we have that we have

1176
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:46,559
found and they are documented in the

1177
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:47,440
draft

1178
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,680
so on the one hand some that lead to

1179
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,680
some sub-optimal configuration so one of

1180
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,880
them is the

1181
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,920
lack of manipulating a list of practices

1182
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,200
okay so

1183
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,839
typically you need to

1184
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,720
you can only do one prefix at a time in

1185
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,440
one entry okay so you will have to

1186
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,520
duplicate many entries to create that

1187
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,839
for manageability also

1188
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,400
you cannot create or define

1189
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,319
aliases or

1190
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,400
or sets for example as we will see

1191
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,240
prefix is a very common

1192
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,880
functionality that we that we require

1193
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,800
and then functional wise

1194
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,079
um

1195
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,160
we lack uh

1196
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,040
the handling fragments of ip4 so we can

1197
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,559
discard for example

1198
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,800
a fragments okay

1199
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,800
also the the handling of tcp flux is

1200
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,280
sub-optimal for example

1201
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,000
it does not support all the matching uh

1202
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,559
as for example it is uh supported in pdb

1203
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,040
flow spec okay so

1204
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,480
will see that we could for some do some

1205
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,359
bit

1206
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,319
some mask to be able to filter several

1207
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,680
several deflects

1208
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,559
also in in the actions and right now you

1209
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,520
can accept and discard or either

1210
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,240
silently or or not

1211
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,200
but for example you could also have

1212
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,960
rate limited actions

1213
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,520
also you could perform a payload based

1214
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,960
base filtering

1215
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,720
also separately the couple from this

1216
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,480
functionality of them of the model the

1217
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,079
current model is a device model okay so

1218
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,839
it's intended that you have a device

1219
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,359
that has them

1220
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:22,960
that you program there

1221
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,240
the acl

1222
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,319
but we can also

1223
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:27,440
use it at

1224
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,599
a network level okay to

1225
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,720
manage the the acls in a network for

1226
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,640
example if you want to

1227
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,720
and to configure the

1228
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,240
the perimeter security of the network

1229
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,160
and you to manage

1230
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,319
all the filters

1231
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,400
in a in a central way

1232
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,640
so then you would require also to extend

1233
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,640
the model to be able to

1234
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,720
to use it in a network and maybe bind

1235
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,839
the

1236
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,680
say which hcl applies

1237
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,319
to uh to a device okay

1238
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,559
and also you could be able to reuse the

1239
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,240
acr and

1240
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,880
the content of the acl for some template

1241
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,880
or the sets across regular devices for

1242
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,800
example the prefix list that you do that

1243
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,040
you define is a previous list you can

1244
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,640
you can use a multiple device and you

1245
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,119
can define it once at network level and

1246
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,880
being able to apply it in several

1247
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,920
devices okay so we'll go which is of the

1248
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,319
the problem so the first one uh that we

1249
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,480
mentioned is the

1250
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,440
the

1251
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,119
not that we currently don't have a

1252
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,760
possibility to work with list of

1253
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,359
prefixes okay so

1254
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,200
so now you can only say

1255
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,800
which is the destination ipv4 or the

1256
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,680
next image ipv6 or the source

1257
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,359
and ipv4 or ipv6

1258
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,400
however uh when we didn't want to for

1259
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,119
example mitigate detours attacks

1260
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,920
we need to provide a

1261
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,319
big list of addresses

1262
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,400
and even if we didn't want to do the

1263
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,720
combination of sources and destinations

1264
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,000
even if it makes a worse the problem

1265
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,319
multiplies okay so then if we want to

1266
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,240
create those rules today we wouldn't

1267
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,920
require a

1268
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,040
and multiplied by m entries okay so

1269
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,040
instead of creating a single

1270
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,200
a single entry okay so

1271
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,440
this is how

1272
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,200
with the old one just to create the

1273
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,200
destination and source

1274
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,079
in

1275
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,680
into separate

1276
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,559
entries and you could combine them in a

1277
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,319
in a single one just

1278
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:25,760
by allowing

1279
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,800
changing this to to allow a list

1280
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,280
also the um

1281
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,040
how we've seen that operators work is

1282
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,720
typically

1283
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,800
the network operators maintain

1284
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,520
a prefix list okay to to use initials

1285
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,119
okay and also

1286
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,720
it is very common

1287
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,280
that the department that is manipulating

1288
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,280
this project is a separate department so

1289
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,640
it's typically a security department or

1290
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,720
in the case of business customer even is

1291
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,800
the it can be the

1292
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,160
part of the business department that

1293
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,319
maintains their own

1294
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:01,599
list of officers so typically

1295
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,359
people like to maintain one list okay

1296
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,760
with some naming and all the addresses

1297
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,920
addresses there so that the management

1298
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,319
is separate okay so so we think it's

1299
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,400
it's good to be able to have those

1300
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,640
those in those lists okay so for example

1301
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,559
the the rooting policies already have

1302
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,119
the notion of sets and particularly the

1303
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:20,319
prefix sets

1304
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,079
in that case it's prefix range sets even

1305
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,119
they call it

1306
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,119
a prefix sets

1307
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,000
so

1308
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,760
and also we can generalize this concept

1309
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,359
also to have

1310
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:32,240
aliases or define sets okay so we can

1311
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,920
have these reusable definitions that you

1312
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,880
can use

1313
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,599
across multiple acls and you can have

1314
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,440
for example these prefix the specific

1315
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,119
sets of prefix list where you have all

1316
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,000
these ipv4 or ipv6 prefixes the protocol

1317
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,079
says or port number sets you defined as

1318
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,640
in the the set of the set of ports to

1319
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:53,040
reuse or even icm icmp sets what you can

1320
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,280
filter the type or or or the code and

1321
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,160
you can

1322
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,640
have them already pretty fine and

1323
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,119
reduce them

1324
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:01,839
uh

1325
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,400
also another another thing that we that

1326
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,920
mentioned is the the handling of of lux

1327
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,800
so

1328
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,079
even the acl is applied locally it is

1329
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:13,920
typical sometimes it's triggered by

1330
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,160
biodirectors for example the video flow

1331
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,319
as i mentioned before is one of the

1332
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:21,520
one of the possibilities and the

1333
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,440
we cannot easily map all the all the

1334
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,040
filtering rules and in particular

1335
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,920
one of the things that we

1336
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,240
we cannot do is the

1337
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,480
correlates handling all the

1338
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,400
tcp flags in the in the current draft

1339
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,680
you can

1340
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,880
have um

1341
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,800
select one flag today or one one

1342
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,920
one one bit of the tcp flag

1343
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,920
but you for example cannot

1344
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,400
create a mask too much of a serial tcp

1345
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,839
tcp flux okay

1346
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:56,480
so

1347
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,440
what i what i wanted to ask the

1348
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,960
working world today

1349
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,800
is several questions first of all i mean

1350
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,480
these are the

1351
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,640
we are willing to work on

1352
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,440
on the extensions necessary

1353
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,920
to to fill this discuss but

1354
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,920
we need some guidance from the working

1355
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,400
group especially that

1356
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,839
the starting point

1357
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:21,599
is an existing rfc okay so

1358
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,359
so what are the

1359
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,040
so we want to ask the working group what

1360
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,160
is the

1361
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,240
best suggestion to approach the

1362
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,520
enhancements so

1363
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,400
either

1364
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,920
we have an

1365
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,640
a new version of the acl model so just

1366
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:39,359
version whatever or not fcbs or whatever

1367
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,480
way we can minimize the number of

1368
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,079
compatible changes there there will be

1369
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,119
some number there will be some changes

1370
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,480
that break existing structure but

1371
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,400
minimizing them

1372
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,200
either we could uh augment

1373
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,040
um the

1374
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,839
existing ninja module

1375
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,599
not touch everything that is there but

1376
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:00,400
only

1377
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,000
if we need to add things we have

1378
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,640
everything on on top in some cases it

1379
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,599
will

1380
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:06,559
mean

1381
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,000
having two structure a little bit

1382
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,040
similar but with more capabilities and

1383
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,000
also

1384
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,119
for sure

1385
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,400
open to

1386
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,200
20 quests and to open two opinions here

1387
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,480
and also the

1388
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,400
the differentiation between the network

1389
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,520
model and the device model is okay

1390
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,720
do we create a separate module for the

1391
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,240
network module

1392
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,280
because

1393
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,400
we might need one like that is extending

1394
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,720
for example the itf network and then we

1395
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,240
plug there

1396
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,880
the the sets and the

1397
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,319
and the acl templates on top of it

1398
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:43,920
and

1399
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,240
if we go for that having a separate

1400
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,280
module for the network-wide module of

1401
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,280
acls and sets

1402
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,520
is that module to be work also here in

1403
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,839
net mode or

1404
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:58,880
everywhere so here

1405
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,119
any feedback from

1406
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,680
feedback on this is appreciated so

1407
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,760
thank you

1408
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,799
so jason's in queue

1409
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:11,920
um

1410
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,599
yeah i guess

1411
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,880
just about how to approach the work um

1412
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,920
it might need more discussion

1413
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,160
on the mailing list to see

1414
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,240
how the scope of the work evolves and

1415
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,079
how much functionality is being added

1416
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,839
and how backwards compatible it is but

1417
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:31,280
um you might

1418
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,839
my initial gut is it would probably be a

1419
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:37,440
a separate rfc that augments um you know

1420
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,760
with with extended uh extra

1421
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,040
functionality

1422
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,319
um

1423
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,559
just as a as a as a first cut from what

1424
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,559
i'm seeing from this

1425
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:47,839
um

1426
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,640
about the network versus device model

1427
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,400
i guess i had a question when you say

1428
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,280
device uh

1429
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,559
like a

1430
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:58,400
so there's per interface acls and then

1431
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,000
you have this kind of device or network

1432
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,280
acl

1433
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,880
is the intention that that's that's an

1434
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,720
acl that is

1435
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,960
effectively applied to traffic coming in

1436
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,440
on any interface

1437
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,480
the second question of the network no

1438
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,400
the idea is to be able to

1439
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,480
uh manage uh acls that

1440
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,440
or or sets or prefix lists that are used

1441
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,520
in several devices okay so that you can

1442
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,400
have

1443
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,680
uh

1444
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,480
for example a template an acl template

1445
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,559
and that acl template if you want to

1446
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:35,040
replicate it in several devices okay

1447
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,520
from uh for example from a controller

1448
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,799
that you can

1449
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,119
that you can reuse it easily so it's

1450
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,880
something to facilitate

1451
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,680
the management of hcls and prefix lists

1452
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,280
from a central location for example

1453
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,280
especially for the prefix list then you

1454
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,520
talk on that

1455
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,200
they

1456
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,200
if you define in the operator you define

1457
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,400
some deny list for some service

1458
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,160
this is independent on the device that

1459
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,000
you are your running needs so you will

1460
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,520
define it once

1461
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,480
uh

1462
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,160
and then you will say okay this applies

1463
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,440
in this device this device and this

1464
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,960
device okay

1465
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,400
from a controller perspective then you

1466
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,200
will

1467
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,200
download the specific configuration to

1468
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,079
the device but the network model is uh

1469
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,880
when it's referred to network is that

1470
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,119
applies to several devices okay that was

1471
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:23,520
the and to be able to help

1472
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,920
in managing several devices at the same

1473
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,160
time

1474
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,760
okay it looks like jason doesn't have

1475
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,960
anything more there

1476
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,160
uh so

1477
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,240
in general uh it's a judgment call of

1478
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,200
whether you augment or revise right and

1479
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,359
uh you really have to get into some of

1480
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,440
the details to figure that out

1481
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,240
um

1482
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,079
and then when we start getting into the

1483
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:51,599
details we'll also figure out what the

1484
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,599
details are of device relative to

1485
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,079
network and if there's a existing model

1486
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:57,599
you're augmenting

1487
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,760
all of those getting to those details

1488
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,280
will help you answer the questions on

1489
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,359
your slide right now you just have you

1490
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:04,799
know an empty section so it's a little

1491
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:06,799
hard to evaluate or give you a

1492
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:08,799
definitive answer but you know as a

1493
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,960
general rule if you can uh it's a

1494
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,839
judgment call but if you can augment um

1495
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:16,240
and you're adding optional capability

1496
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,160
augment is the way to as a separate rfc

1497
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,000
is definitely the way to go if you are

1498
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,359
looking for

1499
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,200
um revising the core behavior that

1500
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,359
everyone needs to adhere to then you

1501
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,520
definitely want to rev you know do abyss

1502
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,040
or a placement mod

1503
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,880
model

1504
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,240
so i i think we need to get to the

1505
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,280
details

1506
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,400
and uh

1507
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,880
the the motivation that you've given

1508
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,760
here is just right for the presentation

1509
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,839
i think for the draft rather than focus

1510
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:43,920
on motivation focus on what you're

1511
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,359
actually going to do

1512
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,200
so focus on the new capabilities you're

1513
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,680
defining in the draft describe them and

1514
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,520
then throw out some proposals some

1515
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,240
details and then we can really jump into

1516
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,399
asking this question so you know from

1517
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,640
i uh i i don't think you know we haven't

1518
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,079
heard anyone jump in and say you know

1519
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:04,960
this is completely wrong

1520
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,079
down what we've heard is is uh you know

1521
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:09,119
um

1522
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,000
looking

1523
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,520
at uh

1524
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,440
you know the best way to do it

1525
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,920
but again having details will help us

1526
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,839
understand help the working group judge

1527
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:19,599
whether it's something that they want to

1528
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:22,079
a support and b what's the best best

1529
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:25,280
mechanism to implement it

1530
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:29,040
okay so we can update the draft with uh

1531
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,280
with a we can go in the we can propose

1532
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,720
in the drive that if you want the two

1533
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,640
directions okay one

1534
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,119
that implies breaking a little bit what

1535
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,359
was there and the one that we

1536
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:40,839
would augment

1537
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:43,599
so in some cases we have found that we

1538
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,680
need to break a little bit what was

1539
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,000
was there okay so

1540
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,359
but then i guess we can we can do that

1541
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:50,640
we can prepare a new version of the

1542
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,040
draft with some of these

1543
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,079
of these details and then

1544
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,160
have the conversation to the site thank

1545
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,640
you that's great thank you uh jason's in

1546
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,319
queue we're a little over time but jason

1547
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,880
you can have the last word just a really

1548
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,520
quick question um is there is any of the

1549
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,839
functionality you're proposing here

1550
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:12,400
means stateful firewall behavior is it

1551
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,720
all stateless

1552
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,680
is so far it's all stateless we were not

1553
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,319
considering a stateful so far so it's

1554
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:22,000
all rules

1555
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
no

1556
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,839
follow the same approach

1557
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:31,359
it's only enhancements over what was

1558
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:34,359
there

1559
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,839
