between the last meeting and this

76
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,199

79
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,320
her work and like she couldn't dedicate

81
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,080

89
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,479
chances are the running the idf

90
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,240
hackathon it's like completed like the

91
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
working group last call and there was

92
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,840
like a whole bunch of comments that came

93
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
in and and charles addressed them he's

94
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,360
going to summarize like what is changed

95
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,039
in the draft today

96
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,600
and also the rescue levin online meeting

97
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,440
so that's like miriam

98
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,199
and martin like are going to summarize

99
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,240
like you know what has happened on the

100
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,360
draft

101
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,800
and that should be

102
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,560
something we should hope to adopt in

103
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,680
this

104
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,120
deliverable

105
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,919
and we haven't seen anything pretty much

106
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,440
on the functional requirements for

107
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,800
technologies

108
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,720
other than the uh

109
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,479
the the hum draft like you know i

110
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,960
haven't seen much like in this thing so

111
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,639
like i think this is like going to be

112
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,639
something that's going to come off

113
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,160
uh the

114
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,440
the charter

115
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,600
if like lars so approves right because

116
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,360
we haven't seen any drafts for this like

117
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,199
in the the whole time we've been around

118
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,000
so next slide

119
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,800
so um we have uh two presentations today

120
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,639
it's like a pretty short agenda so like

121
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,120
we're not gonna cut the mic um

122
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,880
if at all possible unless it really runs

123
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,759
into the whole uh to ours uh it's pretty

124
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,759
much like you know martin and maria is

125
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,080
gonna present first uh for the online

126
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,720
meeting organization draft and then

127
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,319
charles is going to summarize the

128
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,039
changes to the hackathon draft um that

129
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,560
have happened after a working group last

130
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,479
call and then um we're going to like

131
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,080
push for along with it like mallory is

132
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,039
going to be

133
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,440
shepherding the document through

134
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,479
and we'll move further and the uh

135
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,400
rechargers of what like we've done is

136
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,240
like maldi and i have gone through all

137
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,120
the comments that came in and during the

138
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,720
recharger proposal

139
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,440
and so we made like all the errors that

140
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,880
are required so i think the last one

141
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,840
came in from myria to address like a

142
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,720
comment uh michael richardson made and

143
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
that has been accommodated i think it

144
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,240
was a couple of days ago that media put

145
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,840
in so after that we haven't seen any

146
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,479
changes so we have pretty much like you

147
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,400
know included all the changes in there

148
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,639
and i'm going to send the mail to the

149
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,080
working group mailing list with all the

150
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,759
kind of changes because it's

151
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,759
done in a google doc it's kind of very

152
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,800
hard to like do all the um like divs in

153
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
there but i can actually run through the

154
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,680
stuff

155
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
at the end of the meeting to actually

156
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,039
walk through the document and just show

157
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,840
you what has changed and then

158
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,440
at some point we need to ship it off the

159
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,800
lars because it's

160
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
something like i hadn't appreciated very

161
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,160
much but

162
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
the the recharger doesn't happen until

163
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,240
we have a charter to put up so there's

164
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,800
no way to put something up uh as a chair

165
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,639
to do it other than going to the 80 and

166
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,479
asking them to put up a straw man in

167
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,560
there so the the goal would be after

168
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,080
like you know a

169
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,000
reasonable cool off time after all the

170
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,319
changes are resolved now uh to ship it

171
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,360
off to lars to uh kick off the recharge

172
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,560
process

173
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,919
uh last any comments there

174
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,599
hey uh yeah not really so i was waiting

175
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,120
for it for the last bullet point there

176
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,400
but but uh

177
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,680
since you mentioned it so i'm i'm

178
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,160
actually totally fine of having a small

179
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,000
charter right if there's work items that

180
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,240
the group has sort of lost energy on i

181
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,319
don't see that as a failure i think i i

182
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,560
see that as a chance to eliminate some

183
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,240
things so so nobody should like feel

184
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,520
that they need to write a draft just

185
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,039
because we have like work that hasn't

186
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,240
been seen in the action for a couple of

187
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
years right um if we're okay with

188
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,159
dropping it i'm okay with dropping it

189
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,159
i'd much rather give give guidance

190
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,320
that's actually going to be helpful

191
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,159
sounds good thank you very much thank

192
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,760
you

193
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,360
so

194
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,959
is there any other comments on the

195
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,359
agenda itself

196
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,959
if not let's uh

197
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,080
switch to uh martin and media

198
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,839
so we we don't have any slides from you

199
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,680
did i get that right uh

200
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,839
mutton on

201
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,560
media

202
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,160
just to prove their stories in the data

203
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,720
transfer and they're loaded into media

204
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,640
okay so okay martin if you'd like to

205
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,680
drive

206
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,239
go ahead all right

207
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,080
okay

208
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,040
uh i think this the hackathon draft is

209
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,560
loaded twice

210
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,040
that's what i'm seeing

211
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,920
try again

212
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,160
i can see the slides there

213
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,480
they're processing tracker they've been

214
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,320
processing for a while so i don't know

215
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,839
if that's because they're really large

216
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,519
you can also do a screen share if you'd

217
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,800
rather

218
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,000
um

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,920
so yeah i processed them immediately but

220
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,519
they're still showing for me as

221
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,519
processing so it could just be the file

222
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,959
as large

223
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,680
or something

224
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,600
okay i have um i have a sharing request

225
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,800
up that i think needs approval

226
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,160
i've done it no yeah yeah it's not

227
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,399
showing up

228
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,079
okay i'm just gonna share my screen i

229
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,680
think it's probably

230
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,959
more productive at this point

231
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,479
i think it's starting oops

232
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,959
i i can see it saying screen share is

233
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,959
being started but nothing coming through

234
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,839
yet

235
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,439
all right can everyone see that

236
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,360
yes

237
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,319
okay i see the comments great thank you

238
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,440
so uh the purpose the strap that near

239
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
and i wrote it's just about you know

240
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,200
kind of how you set up an online meeting

241
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,480
it's kind of just a guide to all of

242
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,880
those things and it covers uh

243
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,040
a lot of the

244
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,880
um for lack of a better word traditions

245
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,320
we developed over the past year and a

246
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,279
half

247
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,959
um i don't think any of this would be a

248
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,880
big surprise to anyone

249
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,200
um

250
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,959
i mean you can look at it we've

251
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,680
not

252
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,839
much of this has not changed uh the one

253
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,800
thing that really has changed is uh

254
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,920
time zone selection so um

255
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,839
after a lot of discussion one or two

256
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,959
meetings ago we uh

257
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,480
settled on

258
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,200
i thought there was pretty good

259
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,600
consensus in the room to for any given

260
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,200
meeting not optimized for a particular

261
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,600
time zone but try to optimize for two

262
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,920
time zones so that in any given three

263
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,360
meaning rotation

264
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,920
uh one of the uh

265
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,880
one of the like official regions um

266
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,279
would only really have an awful meeting

267
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,240
slot

268
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,320
uh once per year

269
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,079
so what that means is that rather than

270
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,600
having like a north america time slot

271
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,200
and an asia time slot in the europe time

272
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,360
slot there's a night time slot for each

273
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,519
of those so this is the one where that

274
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,200
suffers and then

275
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,959
uh the other

276
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,560
of the other two regions one is like

277
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,079
having one start about breakfast and

278
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,680
having one start the other one and the

279
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,519
third one is having the meeting start

280
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,440
about dinner time or so

281
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,639
uh and then

282
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,800
like the truly like you know graveyard

283
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,639
shift hours are

284
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,880
are uh

285
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,519
only happen once a year so um you can

286
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,360
see those times uh i'm going to talk a

287
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,639
little bit about the scoring in a minute

288
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,480
but i but we did mention before like a

289
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,639
sort of scoring system for

290
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,160
um

291
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,920
various time zones and the hours in

292
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,720
which

293
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,160
uh a given utc start time would uh occur

294
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,920
and after some messing around with that

295
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,200
these are the these are the times we

296
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,320
came up with and what are currently in

297
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,440
the draft um we did make the step of

298
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,959
separating out northern summer and

299
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,240
northern winter because obviously

300
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,959
daylight savings has an impact on on

301
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,680
what's optimal

302
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,519
once we move to this knight based

303
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,440
concept

304
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,040
we also had to revise the rules for

305
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,279
selection so that table there which is

306
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,320
in the draft in the lower right is is a

307
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,000
very complicated way of saying that

308
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,120
basically whatever um whatever time zone

309
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,199
had a fairly uh

310
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,279
favorable time slot before like you're

311
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,040
the one that's going to be in the night

312
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,399
uh

313
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,839
if it's an online meeting and it kind of

314
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,920
covers all the permutations of having

315
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,560
previous online meetings for uh

316
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,120
in-person meetings um

317
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,560
according to this framework so it's just

318
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,040
it's just an algorithm that that

319
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,240
tells you

320
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,680
how to pick the time slot for a remote

321
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,639
meeting

322
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,880
that might not be tied to a to a

323
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
physical location that got cancelled it

324
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,480
could just be a deliberate online

325
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,079
meeting so that you know that's one of

326
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,800
the things we had to work around

327
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,959
okay this is the final scoring system uh

328
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,800
early fi you know current scoring system

329
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,880
i should say so dear and i talked about

330
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,639
this a little bit and we

331
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,800
um assigned kind of

332
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,360
pain points for hours uh

333
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,760
0.05 being the worst and then kind of

334
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
the one shoulder hour there

335
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,880
uh

336
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,480
our two points

337
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,040
and then um

338
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,519
there were

339
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,120
each one of those time zones had a

340
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,880
median score among the three meetings

341
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,199
per year so this is the second worst

342
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,480
time zone and this is what we're trying

343
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,600
to minimize

344
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,920
so uh there's there's one there's one

345
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,600
time slot of the three where you're just

346
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,440
gonna get it just it's gonna be very

347
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,279
inconvenient and then if we can make the

348
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,720
second one painless according to the

349
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,639
scoring system that's a that's a pretty

350
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,720
good outcome or come as close to that as

351
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,920
we can do uh for asia we just took

352
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,480
sydney japan china and india um as sort

353
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,519
of

354
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,680
i mean i think it's

355
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,360
it's just a sort of sample of

356
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,279
representative time zones that uh that

357
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,720
are relevant to itf um

358
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,880
and uh we we took the medians for each

359
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,399
of those times those are the simple mean

360
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,800
of those four india is really quite an

361
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,279
outlier in terms of times relative to

362
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,440
because kind of as everyone knows is

363
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,320
kind of between asia and or east asia

364
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,839
and uh

365
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,279
uh europe

366
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,560
uh so

367
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,160
that turns out to be a little odd in

368
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,839
terms of scoring but nevertheless that's

369
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,600
what we did with europe we just used cet

370
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,800
of course there's only

371
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,120
there's you know

372
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
fewer time zones in europe than most

373
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,560
other places and in north america we

374
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,920
just took the eastern and pacific time

375
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,600
zones and just did a did a simple mean

376
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,880
of those two to to and minimize that

377
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,320
so um you might be wondering what those

378
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,360
thoughts mean for you we've done the

379
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
math for you here so uh

380
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,000
given what we have in the draft uh for

381
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,600
utc times this is what it means for you

382
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,560
um

383
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,920
or at least you can figure out what it

384
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,279
means for you based on the time zones

385
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,480
you see here

386
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,720
uh

387
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,959
take give me a minute to look at that

388
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,120
and that's that uh there's no other

389
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,680
changes since my last talk on this um

390
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,800
mira do you have anything to add

391
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,320
yeah there actually there were a few

392
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,160
more changes but uh most of them were

393
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,600
actually structural and editorial and

394
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,560
then there was a little bit more

395
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,440
discussion added based on okay i guess

396
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,880
she has nothing to add unless my audio

397
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,519
is broken um

398
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,440
so i guess the question is is this ready

399
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,360
for adoption or do people

400
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,720
are people not happy with the general

401
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,279
direction of this draft

402
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,000
i i think media did say something uh

403
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
so we could hear her

404
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,519
i'm apparently having some audio

405
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,679
problems uh and i'm not hearing

406
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,480
things

407
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,240
uh to answer the question in the chat

408
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
the 112 meaning does not fall into these

409
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,640
slots uh in one of these slots

410
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,439
uh the isg's sort of emergent

411
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,439
habit has been to

412
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,520
schedule it at 1200 or 1300 local time

413
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,319
um

414
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,000
in the absence of any sort of consensus

415
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,200
document so i i i'm fairly optimistic

416
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,440
113 will be in person in some sense but

417
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,120
if for some reason it isn't and if this

418
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,520
moves quickly we might use this as a

419
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,200
framework instead of

420
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,160
um

421
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,960
the the existing tradition

422
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,200
can people not hear me

423
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,919
on my audio output right okay yeah i'm

424
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,720
not sure what's going on

425
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,520
all right great

426
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,039
uh i'll answer the question to chat

427
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,880
since i can't seem to hear anybody for

428
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,160
some reason

429
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,240
um

430
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,240
just tell me in the chat if i need to be

431
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,080
quiet because someone else is talking

432
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,760
uh thoughts on hybrid timing um i don't

433
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,520
well this draft doesn't really address

434
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
that i think in practice

435
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,200
we will have to at least do it during

436
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,280
the day of the

437
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,080
of the um of the the the host venue but

438
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,160
for no reason for the actual support

439
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,840
staff to be able to do that

440
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,080
um

441
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,280
uh as for uh what specific time of day

442
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,840
it will be like

443
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,720
i'm there's been there have been no

444
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,080
discussions about that and this this

445
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,918
draft is not on that topic at all

446
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,799
um maria since you got cut off did you

447
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,799
want to come back make your point and

448
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,200
thank you

449
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,360
yeah i don't think i got okay i'm gonna

450
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,720
uh i'm gonna

451
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,679
attempt to exit meet echo and come back

452
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,720
in um because this is not working but i

453
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,559
can't hear anybody uh

454
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,840
so just give me a moment please

455
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,120
yep hey

456
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,600
um yeah then let me talk first thing so

457
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,840
um this draft had some more editorial

458
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,600
changes a little bit of restructuring

459
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,919
and there's a new section on some

460
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,080
considerations about how to use the

461
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,679
online time not flexible because we

462
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,200
don't necessarily have to squeeze

463
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,440
everything into one week but it doesn't

464
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,960
give a clear recommendation it's just a

465
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,120
discussion about what the options are so

466
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,160
that's the other thing that was added

467
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,880
can you hear us now

468
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,959
restarting always works um

469
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,280
hey nobody say

470
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,760
maria just a quick question for you um

471
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,000
like not related to the schmo itself

472
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
right but uh like this experiment of the

473
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,919
two week thing uh are you planning to

474
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,280
have some kind of survey or something

475
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,200
afterwards to figure out from the people

476
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,159
what they thought is that the plan i

477
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:06,880
mean

478
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,240
martin could could answer this as well

479
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,760
because he wrote the text about the

480
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,200
experiment i think the email is very

481
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,720
clear that we have some evaluation

482
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,039
criteria there and so there is a survey

483
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,320
included there's some data we want to

484
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,400
look at and we will send out um this

485
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,159
evaluation after the meeting for more

486
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,919
discussion

487
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,600
i mean not and probably also to the to

488
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,440
the many coaches list or to schmooze but

489
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,200
like not necessary only because it was

490
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,200
an ietf white experiment so i i assume

491
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,280
that this pattern will happen also on an

492
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,559
itf white malinitis i don't know

493
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,200
okay thank you

494
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,900
so whether you hear me

495
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,240
[Music]

496
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,880
yeah we can

497
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,840
[Music]

498
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,440
okay um

499
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,640
okay i have no camera

500
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,000
yeah so uh the question was whether this

501
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,760
uh direction of considering uh four

502
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,960
slots

503
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,240
instead of three slots

504
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,039
has been considered

505
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,120
you mean

506
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,880
four slots

507
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,799
per year or

508
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,200
per day or in which context

509
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,120
no no okay so there is a number uh three

510
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,280
in this uh

511
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
in this draft right

512
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,000
so

513
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,159
instead of three to make it four

514
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,799
well so there there are three the rfc

515
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,880
number which 79 something i can't

516
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,280
remember all of a sudden specifies three

517
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,159
regions uh in which we consider hosting

518
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,520
meetings asia europe and north america

519
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,640
and um

520
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,840
our intent here in this in this system

521
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,400
is to keep a fair balance between those

522
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,840
three regions

523
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,520
so what so i'm i mean i was a little

524
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,960
verbally sloppy and assuming that there

525
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,320
were three meetings per year in

526
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,679
principle you could have any number of

527
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,520
meetings periods to use this algorithm

528
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,200
but the point is the point is to balance

529
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
the time the the time zone pain across

530
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,280
the three regions listed in the rfc

531
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,200
okay to clarify uh myself

532
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,280
three meetings per year

533
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,159
but um sly

534
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,799
cycling through four

535
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,480
uh time zones not time slots but time

536
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,360
zones okay

537
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,080
uh

538
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,559
so we did not consider that beyond

539
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,559
beyond the the the observation that

540
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,440
there's an iit

541
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,039
ietf consensus document that we should

542
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,720
attempt to balance across the three

543
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,840
regions

544
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,039
listed

545
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,159
um

546
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,919
and so that's what we saw we did if we

547
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,520
did four by definition it wouldn't it

548
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,360
wouldn't you know evenly balance those

549
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,280
considerations okay

550
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,000
okay there are regions and there are

551
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,960
time zones okay

552
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,440
some of the regions

553
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,440
have more time zones than others so

554
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,080
my question whether these uh

555
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,919
so for example

556
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,240
asia has more time than the other

557
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,480
we only took the median of of the time

558
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,720
zone so it's not that they get weighted

559
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,159
more because there are more time zones

560
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,760
considered it's just like the range of

561
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,880
time zones we consider for each region

562
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,559
but it we rate each region uh um equally

563
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,520
so it's

564
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,360
only three values that go in in the

565
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,440
calculation

566
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,320
yeah

567
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,450
uh okay yeah so um

568
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,609
[Music]

569
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,480
no okay

570
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,439
go ahead

571
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,880
to the slide and maybe just walk us

572
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,600
through uh

573
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,440
the chart that you did because i don't

574
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,200
actually know how to read the chart um

575
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,880
i could probably sit down and figure it

576
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,000
out over

577
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
you know i could spend 15 minutes trying

578
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,200
to reverse engineer it but it would be

579
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,480
nice if you guys since you already know

580
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,080
how it works but just sort of explain it

581
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,520
to us

582
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,480
sure uh

583
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,840
sorry to share my thing again um

584
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,360
there we go okay so uh

585
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,919
again in the draft there are three slots

586
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,080
uh per season listed so that's on the

587
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,919
far left here you have

588
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,120
um

589
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,279
you know the utc times that that are on

590
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,200
the previous slide and then for any

591
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,240
given time zone um

592
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,720
uh if

593
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,320
any meeting that in that is in the

594
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,720
northern winter so so take the example

595
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,919
of cet

596
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,919
so um

597
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,679
in the northern winter a meeting would

598
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,320
start at either seven o'clock local time

599
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,559
three p.m local time or 11 p.m local

600
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,440
time

601
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,520
uh in the northern summer

602
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,200
cet meetings would start at seven

603
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,760
o'clock 3 p.m or

604
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
or midnight local time

605
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,000
um

606
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,520
does that make it clearer so i mean so

607
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,600
so i think the the the takeaway from

608
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,039
this is that

609
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,480
one meeting assuming there are three

610
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,720
beings per year that one one of those

611
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,400
meetings will be essentially in the

612
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,080
middle of the night and the other ones

613
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,360
will be

614
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,640
relatively

615
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,480
uh i mean not not like right in the

616
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,720
middle of work day but but

617
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,159
during the hours people usually awake

618
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,559
thanks does that help a little

619
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,039
bootstrapping

620
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,840
okay

621
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,320
andrew

622
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,520
i just sort of picking up the uh this

623
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,640
discussion

624
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,720
from the chat uh i think for scoring

625
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,679
purposes you could conceivably just uh

626
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,080
responding to the point from uh alex

627
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,760
earlier

628
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,799
alternate the uh asia pack

629
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,480
time zone so rather than taking a medium

630
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,200
because it is so wise uh you you could

631
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,279
even alternate between say uh india and

632
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,520
i mean i was put in the chat maybe japan

633
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,440
but you i mean you could pick

634
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,400
randomly

635
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,159
someplace on the other side

636
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,159
towards the other side of the region but

637
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,960
i think the reality is having said that

638
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,480
you're gonna kind of end up with some

639
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,360
variation of three start times roughly

640
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,039
eight hours apart

641
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,799
um

642
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,200
i i suspect whatever whatever algorithm

643
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,480
you use

644
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,880
um so you could

645
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,640
make the scoring more sophisticated but

646
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,559
i'm not sure you actually end up with uh

647
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,200
with any better answer um

648
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,400
the the the than you have because it's

649
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,600
gonna have to share the pain somehow

650
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,960
yeah we certainly we've certainly played

651
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,159
with it a little bit um i don't

652
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,520
if someone has a very compelling case

653
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,200
that a particular scoring system other

654
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,960
than what we did is like is absolutely

655
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,399
the right way to do this then then i'd

656
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,480
be open to that but uh stickering with

657
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,000
us is not going to get us very far it is

658
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,159
an interesting idea to say that we have

659
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,480
a what i think is in the chat and

660
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,480
there's a there's a theme here that

661
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,679
maybe when we do the

662
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,120
well i'm not sure how it would work

663
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,679
actually i i guess if uh in the

664
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,640
north american night and the

665
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,440
europe night slots if the

666
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,120
asian slot maybe sometimes tried to

667
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,399
minimize the pain for india and

668
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,880
sometimes tried to minimize the pain for

669
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,159
for japan

670
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,679
um

671
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,520
that is a little bit

672
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,360
hard to work through but if there's a

673
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,799
strong consensus that we should do that

674
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,000
i think we could probably work out

675
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,279
something in that

676
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,480
in that

677
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,559
so i think you can make the scoring

678
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,320
scheme uh

679
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,919
as complicated as you want you can add

680
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,360
more stuff and i'm not sure if the

681
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,120
result would change from that

682
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,679
um as i said the optimization criteria

683
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,600
is really to only have one slot that is

684
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,200
really bad which means the other two

685
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,120
slots are probably doable but also not

686
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,880
the best slot you can get

687
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,039
that's that's the the main criteria and

688
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,640
like for yourself i think you should

689
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,320
look at what time zone you're in and if

690
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,279
the times for you are somehow acceptable

691
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,960
and that's also what we did and like we

692
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,039
phone and and this what we suggest seems

693
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,039
to be for all time zones we we

694
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,200
considered that the spots seem to be

695
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,559
acceptable there's

696
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,000
one thing about

697
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,120
india

698
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,640
might suffer slightly more than the

699
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
other time zones but there's no perfect

700
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,679
solution

701
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,919
well so i do want to um

702
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,360
like i i think it's a little more subtle

703
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,720
than that uh

704
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,880
india india is experiencing something

705
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,320
more like a lot of us are experiencing

706
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
during this current tempo which is that

707
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,039
uh

708
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,480
like there are two slots that are kind

709
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
of bad so you're you know there's one

710
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,000
where you go to bed at two and there's

711
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,080
one i mean we could look at the

712
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,679
you look at the slide presentation again

713
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,120
but uh

714
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,200
there's there are two like moderately

715
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,799
painful slots instead of one that's

716
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,399
horrible and then the two other two are

717
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,240
fine so

718
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,360
um

719
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,799
you know ages big

720
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,559
as as you may not know

721
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,679
and uh uh this is a hard problem but um

722
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,640
that's kind of where we ended up

723
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,880
thanks uh martin thanks maria so um so

724
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,039
you you folks think it's uh ready for

725
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,279
the draft is ready for adoption

726
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,880
okay i think so i mean we can certainly

727
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,039
have we can i would i'm open to another

728
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,640
discussion about maybe doing something

729
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,960
creative with this the breadth of asia

730
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,279
as long as it's um as long as it's kind

731
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,679
of done within asia uh and doesn't mess

732
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,039
the balance between the three regions i

733
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,799
think that would be perfectly fine

734
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,720
but uh you know how that works is not

735
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,120
obvious and uh

736
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,640
um that would require discussion but

737
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,120
that shouldn't block adoption in my view

738
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,720
yeah so that can be part of the working

739
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,720
group process uh martin luther

740
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,039
we decided to do something so um so what

741
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,039
we can do is we can get a adoption call

742
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,159
kicked off uh next week um yeah like i i

743
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,440
think it's like we seen generally

744
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,880
possible stuff but i'm sure there's like

745
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,799
other stuff that's gonna come up uh so

746
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,559
we can handle it during the working

747
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,279
group stages of the craft that's okay

748
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,480
yeah oh and just for people's

749
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
information so the india time slots are

750
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,039
11 00 in the morning to 5 pm which is

751
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,240
the best one 7 p.m to 1 a.m which is

752
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,559
pretty bad and then 3 a.m to 9 a.m which

753
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,080
in my view is really bad

754
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,600
uh but i mean you can sort of see the

755
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,159
dynamics of that it's

756
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,600
it's not quite an overnight shift

757
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
and i would like to reply to this idea

758
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,080
of having four time slots which are each

759
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,840
five hours apart i don't think that will

760
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,440
solve the problem because that just

761
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,240
means um that you have to suffer in more

762
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,840
of these time slots so currently we have

763
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,279
three time slots

764
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,600
um so hopefully you you wherever you are

765
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,519
have to only suffer really badly for one

766
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,600
of them instead of for two or more

767
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,960
that's the that's the goal here i don't

768
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,480
think adding more time slot will make it

769
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,720
better

770
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,480
i mean like if there's another proposal

771
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,159
i'm happy to consider it but like we

772
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,080
have been thinking about this so much um

773
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,960
and

774
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,519
and uh really check your time zone and

775
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,039
see if this is acceptable for you and

776
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,880
let's move on

777
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,120
okay thanks peter uh nick uh go ahead

778
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,480
uh yeah i just wanted to

779
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,039
uh change the topic a little bit to um

780
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,200
there there wasn't as much advice in

781
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,880
this draft and it has been a sort of

782
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,559
active question on

783
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,960
sort of attendee lists about uh about

784
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,399
how to handle socializing uh among itf

785
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,120
participants but i don't know what it is

786
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,200
like for other people i think i'm still

787
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,039
struggling with that i

788
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,799
haven't always made it to the gather

789
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,799
things i'm not quite sure how to use it

790
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,600
um

791
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,399
just

792
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,640
should we in this draft or sometime soon

793
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,960
like provide some recommendations about

794
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,600
about what to do

795
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,240
so the draft does mention that um you

796
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,760
know there is there is a little bit of a

797
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,840
trade-off between online meetings are

798
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,200
more open it's more easier to

799
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,880
participate in general in the meeting

800
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,960
but you're missing out the social

801
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,600
um component um so there's a discussion

802
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,440
about that and the

803
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,120
draft generally encourages people to

804
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,559
experiment with things but i don't have

805
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:19,919
a good solution i don't have a great

806
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,159
proposal so i don't know what what else

807
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,000
to add to the draft but

808
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,480
uh proposal welcome

809
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,320
i mean we can if somebody would want to

810
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,760
suggest some text that kind of hits it

811
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,480
again like space i'm i'm perfectly open

812
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,919
to that i do think they're fundamental

813
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,159
limitations when you're at home

814
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,600
um

815
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,480
when it might be a bad time time zone or

816
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,000
uh you know there are other things i

817
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,440
think it's harder to get people to just

818
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,440
go socialize because they have you know

819
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,120
other things to do whereas when you're

820
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,640
at the hotel you have nothing to do but

821
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,320
but go interact with your fellow

822
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,399
attendees uh it's probably a fundamental

823
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,960
limitation in my view but uh

824
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,480
but yeah i think if there's any sort of

825
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,440
tooling um

826
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,880
i'm not i'm not opposed to having a

827
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,000
section in the draft but i'm not sure

828
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,640
what that would say

829
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,960
to be clear i i agree that it's hard i

830
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,880
wasn't saying oh this is easy you should

831
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,120
answer it but um yeah

832
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,440
but i also sort of wonder if like maybe

833
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,360
we should say like it is going to be

834
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,000
hard and we should try to force it a

835
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,840
little bit because otherwise people

836
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,399
won't do it

837
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,399
yeah i i

838
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,840
think like you know it's one thing to

839
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,519
say like hey we need to have a mechanism

840
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,720
and the other one is to force like i

841
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,399
think i have the same problem like you

842
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,000
know media was stating right like it's

843
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,919
the uh when something is online and

844
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,000
offset from your time zone it's gonna be

845
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,720
very hard to find the time so um like i

846
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,039
greatly appreciate some text uh input

847
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,440
there nick thank you

848
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,279
yeah so as i said there is text saying

849
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,960
socializing is a problem we see this

850
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,039
because the zero drafts for example

851
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,120
going down and the text currently says

852
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,720
this should be considered right it

853
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,559
doesn't say more than that so like look

854
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,720
at x section four three and if you have

855
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,799
additional wording please propose it

856
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,799
yeah okay thanks uh lars go ahead

857
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,799
yeah two points on that same time for

858
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,880
that nick race so so i on this meeting

859
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,079
and also with last week for me

860
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,839
personally the half hour breaks are sort

861
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,639
of

862
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,639
um too short and too long at the same

863
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,879
time in some sense that um they're long

864
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,399
enough that i do some other things but

865
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,839
then i don't have time to hang out on

866
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,239
gather um if it's a 15-minute break i

867
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,800
think i'm sort of more more uh

868
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,639
happy to drop in but this is sort of the

869
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,480
worst of both worlds so i'm kind of

870
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,239
wondering if we should sort of as an

871
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,918
option describe you know having a

872
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,079
one-hour break at some point during that

873
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,679
meeting so that you know you can eat

874
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,359
something and and then still have some

875
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,560
time together

876
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,480
um for those of us who don't like to eat

877
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,639
in front of the screen um but that's

878
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,159
sort of just a minor suggestion the

879
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,159
other thing i wanted to suggest is a

880
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,440
little bit

881
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,679
earthquake

882
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,280
are you proposing then because the draft

883
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,679
also says you we shouldn't um extend the

884
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,280
day more than six hours so are you

885
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,960
proposing to actually accept the day or

886
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,599
just using well i guess it would have to

887
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,960
be excited because i don't think we can

888
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,720
eat into the working room and i totally

889
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,400
get the time the the trade-off here

890
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,200
right if you're in the middle of the

891
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,720
night a one-hour break is pretty you

892
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,800
know useless but if you're not it's sort

893
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,720
of quite helpful but you know there's no

894
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,000
somebody said in the chat right there

895
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,839
there's no good solutions

896
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,680
yeah and also the draft doesn't give

897
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,599
like a clear rule that you have to

898
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,119
follow it says this is what we did so

899
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,359
far here the traders please experiment

900
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,200
in future with it so

901
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,800
i mean i'm happy to to to write

902
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,920
something else in the draft if there's

903
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,520
consensus but that's what

904
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,800
is saying the other thing i think i

905
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,599
wanted to sort of bring up is that um

906
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,280
this is about fully online meetings and

907
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,119
and we're hopefully going to go towards

908
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,640
hybrid meetings so people should think a

909
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,200
little bit about uh maybe discuss it on

910
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
the mailing list um

911
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,000
what

912
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,240
what guidance we want to give the

913
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,000
guidance like this hybrid meetings so so

914
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,880
for example um do we wanna

915
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,760
um

916
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,240
you know stick to this rotation or use

917
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,800
this algorithm to schedule the working

918
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,400
group sessions during the day for a

919
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,000
hybrid meeting do we wanna like do the

920
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,480
start at lunch thing do we want to think

921
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,560
about having some flexibility in terms

922
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,200
of

923
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,359
catering to the people on site but also

924
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,160
not making it terrible needlessly for

925
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,960
for people elsewhere um what what do we

926
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,320
want to do in terms of the length of the

927
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,079
day are we okay with going slightly

928
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,520
longer for working group sessions or not

929
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,359
so i think those sorts of things are

930
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,000
what would be really helpful to see some

931
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,920
community input on the list on

932
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,640
specifically as we go towards 113 where

933
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,119
hopefully we would have an in-person

934
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,640
participation

935
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,319
thank you okay thanks lars

936
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,240
wait for the

937
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,800
magic to happen yes um i mentioned in

938
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,960
the chat room and and i think it might

939
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,720
be worth saying something along these

940
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,320
lines in the document

941
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,520
that

942
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,880
my

943
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,800
my use for the past two meetings has

944
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,680
been

945
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,160
for gather to be the sort of home base

946
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,680
for me

947
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,480
and i use the little doors to go into

948
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,680
the sessions and to meet echo and maybe

949
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,320
some mention of experimenting around the

950
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,839
idea of having the social space be the

951
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,440
primary space

952
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,079
and you go into the meeting sessions

953
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:10,880
um

954
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,599
as a potential way to

955
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,760
increase the social interactions between

956
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,960
sessions

957
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,680
and to get people into the habit of

958
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,720
switching

959
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,480
between rooms for instance

960
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,720
to check out other sessions

961
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,560
um because that's become useful i can

962
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,079
step in and go uh no really not or i can

963
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,320
step in and say hey not something that i

964
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,560
normally would go to but there it is up

965
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,839
on the screen and i've been curious

966
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,839
about it and step into a room

967
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,200
um

968
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,839
and not specifying gather but specifying

969
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:46,000
tools that are around socialization and

970
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,560
cross-area interactions

971
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,440
in rooms um something along those lines

972
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,040
might be useful to

973
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,040
point out as a good part of the

974
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,599
experiment

975
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,160
it does sound a little bit like a

976
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,440
tooling

977
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,160
consideration

978
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,200
um

979
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,160
and you know we can't push a particular

980
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,880
one in in the draft i don't think that's

981
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,720
useful i think giving the example is

982
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,960
possible but just to sort of center

983
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,760
people around the idea of maybe we have

984
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,320
to think about the general approach to

985
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,480
tooling do we want it to be centered

986
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,920
around sessions do we want to be

987
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,680
centered around social aspects um

988
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,280
and maybe more integrate i thought the

989
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,680
integration so far has been really good

990
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,359
if you start by using gather um so

991
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,119
some discussion about what we've seen so

992
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,560
far

993
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,760
yeah jay

994
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,680
did we were kicking at one point the

995
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,079
idea of beat echo deliberately kicking

996
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,320
you in together when you left a session

997
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,200
um

998
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,200
i'm not sure what happened with that uh

999
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,720
because i know that was an intent maybe

1000
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,160
it just turned out to be

1001
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,160
a problem for some reason

1002
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,079
yeah there were but yeah i think

1003
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,480
together as a specific i think

1004
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,640
for that

1005
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,800
um

1006
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,320
i mean some people really don't like

1007
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,560
gather for one reason or another

1008
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,079
um

1009
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,040
but it is what it is

1010
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,680
requirements are a bit tighter than

1011
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,119
meet recording like you know like

1012
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,400
there's some stuff that i got me take

1013
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,000
out of work but not gather so i think

1014
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,079
that could be like some

1015
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,599
technical showstopper there right like

1016
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,680
you know if the you cannot get kicked in

1017
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,560
together

1018
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,079
well jay's in the chat and says he

1019
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:30,960
doesn't know what happened to that

1020
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,400
either this might just be an oversight

1021
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,119
so maybe we'll fix it just in time for

1022
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,520
the online meetings to be done i kind of

1023
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,800
i kind of remember this i'm already in

1024
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,000
the queue so

1025
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,640
um i remember it on the list and so my

1026
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,640
use case especially in irtf is we have a

1027
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,119
lot of day passers and a lot of like

1028
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,040
invited speakers and it would create a

1029
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,880
really unnecessary speed bump because

1030
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,240
they're already struggling to use the

1031
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,240
tool for the first time to get on the

1032
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,839
agenda to get in the room and so if

1033
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:56,640
you're

1034
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,240
forcing them into these

1035
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,240
other things that are out of band for

1036
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,200
them because they're not trying to

1037
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,359
socialize that could be a problem and so

1038
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,800
then of course you'd have to create an

1039
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,119
alternative where you could just dip in

1040
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,560
based on the agenda and then that's what

1041
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,480
everybody would use so you lose that

1042
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,440
sort of

1043
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,800
you know you're centering everybody

1044
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,760
because they'll

1045
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,359
they'll use what works for them and it

1046
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,240
probably won't be gathered

1047
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,880
i think that's really important yeah

1048
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,839
i don't think

1049
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:22,880
so i don't think any of these

1050
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,480
considerations belong into this draft

1051
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,920
actually um because it's really more

1052
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,119
about two links maybe it would be a

1053
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,359
separate draft but um if people think

1054
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,119
something should go into this draft then

1055
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,119
please let us know

1056
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,720
i was in the queue for a different point

1057
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,400
around social stuff that maybe we could

1058
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,560
say so one thing that might work

1059
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,280
well but would require a bit of

1060
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,880
decentral organization we couldn't

1061
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,480
really prescribe it we could suggest it

1062
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,920
it would also probably require a bit of

1063
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,640
sponsorship is to have local

1064
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,839
meetings um in fa like face-to-face um

1065
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:52,640
where

1066
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,520
there are lots of people that live like

1067
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,640
in dc for example or san francisco um

1068
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,119
paris or places where you actually do

1069
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:01,920
have

1070
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,079
a community of ietfers they might know

1071
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,280
each other already because they live in

1072
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,119
the same town

1073
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,800
that could be something to encourage

1074
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,400
because i think it actually is quite

1075
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,000
nice but

1076
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,520
only a half measure for sure

1077
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
so i mean i think this is the original

1078
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,839
idea that was brought up when the many

1079
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,000
coaches list was actually created

1080
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,599
um but the idea never really got so far

1081
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,800
to the point that people actually

1082
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
organized it so i would i would be i

1083
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,240
mean encouraging that is maybe a good

1084
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,160
idea but it would be nice to actually

1085
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,839
see some experience with it

1086
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,000
mallory can you send some text

1087
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,640
suggestions for marianne martin if you

1088
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,160
want to add something there like i i

1089
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,680
think miriam's mind is good like you

1090
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,280
know maybe there's something that can go

1091
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,359
into the draft and there's like other

1092
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,280
stuff like the details like how to do it

1093
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,880
might have to go somewhere else right i

1094
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,680
think

1095
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,359
um either because you can just ship it

1096
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,240
over

1097
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,240
and a really good flag that it was part

1098
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,920
of the original mini couches idea you're

1099
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,079
right so we can also go back to that and

1100
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,240
get folks like dan york and others to

1101
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,839
chime in but yeah i'd be happy to draft

1102
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,839
something up just as a

1103
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,040
suggestion in the realm of experimental

1104
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,960
possibilities right

1105
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,960
and i see a pete saying that there was a

1106
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,440
boston hub experience so if

1107
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,720
anybody was

1108
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,720
actually at that boston hub and could

1109
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,079
report back that would be helpful as

1110
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,240
well

1111
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,839
okay

1112
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:33,680
i think the uh dead is next on the line

1113
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,319
this is the boston pub meeting um

1114
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,599
i went to them

1115
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,800
pretty religiously while they were

1116
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,079
happening they were kind of hard to

1117
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,400
organize there was a there was like not

1118
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
quite the right amount of energy to make

1119
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,160
it happen consistently and also the fact

1120
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,400
that it was asynchronous with iatf meant

1121
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,119
that

1122
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,560
you know people had to come up with sort

1123
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,240
of off uh

1124
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,640
off ietf presentations which meant that

1125
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,880
it was actually a bunch of extra work

1126
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,880
that you had to do so so um

1127
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,319
i think uh

1128
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,920
trying to figure out a way to make those

1129
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,800
meetings synergize with iatf rather than

1130
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,680
um

1131
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,839
sort of be additional to ietf might be

1132
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,040
helpful

1133
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,920
um

1134
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,400
and i think you know i have to say i

1135
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,160
definitely enjoyed

1136
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,160
getting together with ietf people in the

1137
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,079
boston area there was there were plenty

1138
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,920
of people we had you know great

1139
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,160
socialization so so in that sense it was

1140
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,160
good it's just that the amount of work

1141
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,680
that was involved in prepping you know i

1142
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,040
gave a couple of presentations and it

1143
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,079
was like

1144
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,280
you know it was a big hit so um

1145
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,880
that wasn't my topic though it's really

1146
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,160
interesting that mallory brought that up

1147
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,760
because i thought it was great but you

1148
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,760
know had some issues um

1149
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,760
my topic was what would be helpful for

1150
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,200
me is to understand like how those

1151
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,480
meetings were actually organized because

1152
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,760
i've never been at one right was the

1153
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,200
meeting during the itf week was it

1154
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,280
before what kind of presentations did

1155
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,200
you have did you have a social component

1156
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,560
on these kind of events would be

1157
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,319
probably yeah so

1158
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:57,520
so these were interim meetings

1159
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,960
essentially except that they weren't

1160
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,160
working group meetings they were just

1161
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,560
like people get together and uh the

1162
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,000
presentations were just so we'd have

1163
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,520
something to talk about like what are

1164
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,760
people working on you know so so you

1165
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,400
know doing it uh sort of at the same

1166
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,160
time as the itf

1167
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,319
might work well actually but the problem

1168
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,240
is that then you need an actual venue

1169
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,319
like we were basically getting spaces

1170
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,079
loaned by various companies and to do

1171
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,079
that for an entire week would be like

1172
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,359
pretty hard

1173
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:24,560
um

1174
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,200
so yeah but uh i you know we i can

1175
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,040
i can tell you more offline if you want

1176
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,880
about about what this was like or i

1177
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,319
could i could even go into it in detail

1178
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:35,680
here if you feel like we have time and

1179
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,480
want to do it but uh

1180
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,920
i was thinking about bringing it to the

1181
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,920
main this probably rather

1182
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,079
okay um yeah so the thing that i wanted

1183
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,240
to to talk about is that is that you

1184
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,000
just got a whole bunch of questions that

1185
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,680
basically boil down to the thing that

1186
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,079
we're taking off of the charter which is

1187
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,079
tooling right so so

1188
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,000
um basically all these questions about

1189
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,240
meat echo or whatever the social thing

1190
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,160
is are

1191
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:00,960
um

1192
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,960
really questions about what's the right

1193
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,960
tool to solve the problem at least i'm

1194
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,000
going to claim that that's what they're

1195
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
about and the reason i claim that that's

1196
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,319
what they're about is that it was really

1197
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,040
interesting listening to pete talk about

1198
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,800
the way that he's engaging with the itf

1199
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,079
and contrasting that with the way that

1200
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,400
i'm engaging with the ietf in these

1201
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,480
uh weird times because the way i'm

1202
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,920
engaging with the itf in these weird

1203
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,440
times is that itf meetings have just

1204
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,599
become new meetings on my schedule

1205
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,599
there's no longer an ietf event except

1206
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,760
that the week of ietf is like super busy

1207
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,119
for me because i have so many extra

1208
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,240
meetings um and that's very different

1209
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,079
than the way that i engaged with the itf

1210
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,839
when i was going to the itf in person

1211
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,760
when i went to the itf in person

1212
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,280
if i had to take a work meeting that was

1213
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,000
like a big imposition on my itf schedule

1214
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,160
now it's exactly the opposite and i

1215
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,599
think that uh

1216
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,880
that uh you know some folks probably the

1217
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,200
people who show up for for gather

1218
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,040
are trying to replicate trying to

1219
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,480
continue the experience that they had

1220
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,720
with with in person its um

1221
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,839
so

1222
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,200
like i miss

1223
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,119
um the things that i got out of the

1224
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,280
in-person ietf in terms of socialization

1225
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,040
but gather isn't solving that problem

1226
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,560
for me the problem with gather is that i

1227
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,319
have to go together and i have to be

1228
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,240
there in order to actually interact with

1229
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,760
people and

1230
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,359
because it's it's

1231
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,440
optional and because i've got other

1232
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,240
stuff going on

1233
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,680
it

1234
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,160
it just it's not the right thing like it

1235
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,680
would be nice to have a way that we

1236
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,280
could um

1237
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,280
that we could have a

1238
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,359
sort of impromptu

1239
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,440
discussions forum

1240
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,640
um

1241
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,520
that uh

1242
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,240
that replicates what what we did in

1243
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,400
i-techs in ietf

1244
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,240
in person meetings the way that that

1245
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,920
side meetings often formed was sort of

1246
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,079
by happenstance you'd walk by somebody

1247
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,280
you think oh right i need to talk to

1248
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,280
them about this thing we don't have that

1249
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,200
anymore and i don't think that gather

1250
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,720
really does that because you kind of

1251
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,960
have to be able to spend like a bunch of

1252
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,880
time and gather to make that work and

1253
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,560
it's hard to justify spending that time

1254
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,079
so it would be kind of nice if there was

1255
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,760
like a much lower

1256
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,560
uh

1257
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,560
cost way to

1258
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,119
uh to be sort of in the same room with

1259
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,160
everybody

1260
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,520
uh

1261
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,680
rather than gather like personally like

1262
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,680
if jabber was a little bit more

1263
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,680
functional i'd say let's just have a

1264
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,520
jabber room that's like where everybody

1265
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,440
is between sessions

1266
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,240
and like if you're doing ietf yeah yeah

1267
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,240
we do have an itf slack channel that is

1268
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,800
only sparsely used by a subset of people

1269
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,760
i think

1270
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,599
but the itf is also

1271
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,520
working on or the tools team basic is

1272
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,920
working on to going away from jabba and

1273
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,440
using other chat tools where you have

1274
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,440
more this kind of channel kind of uh set

1275
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,200
up on and might make it easier to

1276
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,720
connect to people directly in these kind

1277
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,800
of things so there is work in progress

1278
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,960
there um

1279
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,240
uh

1280
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,640
i'm not disagreeing with you at all

1281
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,520
um but talking about the charter um i

1282
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,880
think that the reason why we took off

1283
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,240
this item from the charter was because

1284
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,839
in a lot of cases we were just diving

1285
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,599
into like very low level requirements

1286
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,680
about you know using ip6 or how the

1287
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,960
button should look like if it should be

1288
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,480
green or yellow or whatever and i think

1289
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,000
for these low level things it's not

1290
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,559
useful to have an rsc for more high

1291
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,319
level consideration requirements what

1292
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:13,839
you were talking about this might be

1293
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,000
useful but um we need to think more

1294
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,280
about it and we need more discussion

1295
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,400
about it

1296
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,079
yeah i mean when when i heard that it

1297
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,400
was being taken off the off the charter

1298
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,400
my immediate reaction was i should write

1299
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,440
a

1300
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,960
draft before it gets taken off the

1301
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,160
charter because i actually think it's

1302
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,440
pretty important

1303
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,319
so

1304
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:31,440
you know

1305
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,720
in my copious free time but yeah

1306
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,359
i'm not sure if you know the the item we

1307
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:38,880
took of the charter was really more

1308
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,559
about low light level requirements so i

1309
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,079
think like if you really have this kind

1310
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,599
of high level requirements about how to

1311
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,119
improve socializing this might still be

1312
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,960
in scope i mean check that out just got

1313
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,800
a charter but um the first step is

1314
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,720
really writing a draft that that forces

1315
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,400
discussion and that might help us to

1316
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,760
make progress

1317
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,240
yeah i think

1318
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,920
that's like a really bad echo

1319
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,960
so i think uh

1320
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,800
okay i think i probably have to call

1321
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,800
back

1322
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,960
should i speak whilst uh was he's

1323
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,400
sure

1324
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,800
okay um well

1325
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,240
just reflect on the last conversation

1326
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,599
i'll get to the three points i wanted to

1327
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,760
make i i think the fundamental problem

1328
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,680
with um

1329
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,680
the socialization thing uh remotely is

1330
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,200
uh we're all remote um and uh

1331
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,000
yeah

1332
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,359
you can't do

1333
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,599
things you would do in socialization

1334
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,000
like drink beer or you can but drinking

1335
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,319
beer by yourself is a bit sort of sad

1336
00:49:58,319 --> 00:49:59,760
and uh

1337
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,280
not quite the same and depending on what

1338
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,960
time zone you're in you're maybe not

1339
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,680
sleeping in order to socialize and so on

1340
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,559
so

1341
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:07,359
i

1342
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,520
yeah this may be the wrong venue to say

1343
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,960
this but i think

1344
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,520
actually uh completely replicating the

1345
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,079
whole of the in-person experience with

1346
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,920
the remote meeting is probably

1347
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,119
impossible

1348
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,319
um

1349
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,319
if we if if we're all in different time

1350
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,359
zones

1351
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,559
um

1352
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,040
yeah i think it's the wrong thing to try

1353
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,559
and replicate um because in my view it's

1354
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:31,280
not

1355
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,000
it's not solvable uh

1356
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,359
remotely

1357
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,359
um

1358
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:39,440
the the other comments then just pick up

1359
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,680
the things i wanted to to to then cover

1360
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,960
um someone pose a question uh

1361
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,520
possibly martin uh about

1362
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,200
when we go to hybrid meetings should we

1363
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,000
use the time zones in this paper

1364
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,880
um i think that's a horrible thing to do

1365
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,040
um i think when we go to hybrid meetings

1366
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,079
we surely have to use the the the model

1367
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,319
of the time zone where the meeting is

1368
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,880
actually happening in person

1369
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,640
because otherwise if you think about it

1370
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,640
we're asking people to pay extra to be

1371
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,319
there in person

1372
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:13,440
to have a dumbed-down experience

1373
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,359
to suit the people that aren't

1374
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,000
there in person i think that

1375
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,800
doesn't make a great deal of sense

1376
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,559
i think the better thing to do is to try

1377
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,839
and uplift the remote experience to make

1378
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,200
it better

1379
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,280
rather than limit the in-person

1380
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,000
experience to make that worse

1381
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,680
um so i think that needs a different

1382
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,480
solution to a fully remote

1383
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,520
uh

1384
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,359
meeting um one of the things i've

1385
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,119
commented on in the chat is probably

1386
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,119
worth saying is and i've no idea how

1387
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,480
this is going to work

1388
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,079
but i note that igf uh next month

1389
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,119
has adopted a hybrid model um as i said

1390
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:52,880
no connection with that no idea what's

1391
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,920
planned

1392
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,400
um but i think that's bound to throw up

1393
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,400
some interesting observations good or

1394
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,720
bad so there must be some learnings from

1395
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,200
that that will help guide

1396
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,559
atf 113 uh in in different ways so it's

1397
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,640
pretty quite fortuitous timing

1398
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,118
um it's happening when it is um

1399
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:14,800
and then the other thing just finally

1400
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,520
just by chance i noted this morning

1401
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,680
in the news there was an article about

1402
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,599
one of the big hotel chains has done a

1403
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,040
deal with zoo

1404
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,160
to facilitate hybrid meetings

1405
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,400
um so maybe

1406
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,119
um if we go to

1407
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,160
multiple uh in-person

1408
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,280
remote gatherings uh if if you will you

1409
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,319
know maybe that's saying which is gonna

1410
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,400
be more commonplace uh in future anyway

1411
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,079
with at least the meaning that

1412
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,000
conference facilities and so will be

1413
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,480
equipped with the right sort of stuff

1414
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,520
um

1415
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,119
to make that practical i'm not

1416
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,599
advocating for zoom necessarily but they

1417
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,200
got the right kit there presumably it

1418
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,280
will work without the other tooling as

1419
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,880
well

1420
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,119
so um andrew i think what we really need

1421
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:00,800
at this point is having something

1422
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,000
written down if you have a concrete

1423
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,440
proposal of what we should do in a

1424
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,680
hybrid meeting then just um write it

1425
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,960
down in the draft and so we can have

1426
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,119
some discussion based on some text would

1427
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,280
be really helpful because we um

1428
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,520
in in the ieh are also in this in this

1429
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,200
meeting have heard many different

1430
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,720
opinions about different things right

1431
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,800
and it's really hard to to come to a

1432
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,240
conclusion to understand what the

1433
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,559
community wants yeah right now that

1434
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,480
would be the first step here

1435
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,280
now

1436
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,359
i'm all things being equal i hope to be

1437
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,240
in poland igf uh next month so i'll be

1438
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,920
able to sort of put some reflections

1439
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,319
from what the in-person experience in

1440
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,079
the hybrid meeting was

1441
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,000
hopefully there are other people in this

1442
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,319
group that will be attending remotely so

1443
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,319
you can get two halves but dare i say

1444
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,400
murder to to to put forward the paper

1445
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,920
doesn't that need the charter to change

1446
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,760
first because that's out of scope i

1447
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,800
think yeah but i think uh we have the

1448
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,040
charter text now so as soon as that is

1449
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,359
uh um approved like you can start

1450
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:56,800
writing the draft now because it should

1451
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,280
be approved be a proof person and maybe

1452
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,040
one more point because you um made this

1453
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,400
point about there should be additional

1454
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,440
benefits uh for the in-person people and

1455
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,880
then there were comments at the chat

1456
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,480
that like we shouldn't like decrease the

1457
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,400
remote performance or whatever so this

1458
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,359
is kind of a very high level um

1459
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:14,800
principle where we need to find

1460
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,880
agreement right so far when before the

1461
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,839
crisis we we said like we always want to

1462
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,079
optimize for in person because that's

1463
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:23,440
what you pay for and that's what is

1464
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,480
important now we improved remote a lot

1465
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,319
we also tried to improve remote before

1466
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:29,920
but not on the cost of in-person

1467
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,839
meetings now we improved remote a lot

1468
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,599
are we willing to take some of this back

1469
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,599
if it would make a person bad or is

1470
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,200
there enough benefit already by just

1471
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,119
going there and socializing that you

1472
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,359
might also you know take some drawbacks

1473
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:43,440
from for the for the in-person people so

1474
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,200
this is like a high-level principle

1475
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,880
where i don't think we have community

1476
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,720
agreement and some discussion and some

1477
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,919
proposal would be useful

1478
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,720
might be really helpful because i think

1479
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,079
they are for example going to have a

1480
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,160
single mic queue

1481
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,599
um

1482
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,200
so that you know

1483
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,200
you have to use your device if you're in

1484
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,000
person to join the mic queue

1485
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,280
so there might be some simple

1486
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,359
adaptations and i don't yeah personally

1487
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,040
i don't see how that detracts from the

1488
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,960
in-person experience but

1489
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,960
then at least makes everyone on equal

1490
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,079
footing to to have a voice uh

1491
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,480
in the room uh i would imagine

1492
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,240
um so i mean there have also been more

1493
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,839
extreme proposals where people said

1494
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,359
instead of having the whole room set up

1495
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,119
with a screen and the press and so on

1496
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:30,480
everybody should just sit with their

1497
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,240
laptop in a room and participate in this

1498
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,599
way in the meeting right so this is the

1499
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,079
other extreme like we need to figure out

1500
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,839
where we want to be

1501
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:39,440
yeah we're great

1502
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,040
okay thank you

1503
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,040
thanks

1504
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,880
hello uh can you guys hear me

1505
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,079
yes yeah hi uh abdrov uh michael shamed

1506
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,400
me to come to the mic when i was talking

1507
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,960
about the hubs in india so just wanted

1508
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,359
to share a quick experience there uh

1509
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:06,720
when we did it

1510
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,799
uh it was not that successful i think

1511
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,480
the main reason was the people who were

1512
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,599
active in itf in india were actually in

1513
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,240
the itf meeting so it was kind of very

1514
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,799
difficult to sort of organize like in a

1515
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:21,440
hub meeting at that time now if when we

1516
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,200
go back to the hybrid model and there

1517
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,240
are people like you know there is a

1518
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,839
restriction in india

1519
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:27,520
where we are not able to travel because

1520
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,680
of some reason then i think going back

1521
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,359
to the hub model would be a little bit

1522
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:32,799
more successful

1523
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:35,280
and we could try that the issue that we

1524
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,520
have faced at that time was that people

1525
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,000
had so varied interest even in like you

1526
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,520
know this like people some people are

1527
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,559
interested in routing some in apps so

1528
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:47,119
how do we organize hubs like we needed

1529
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:48,960
six seven rooms and that was a

1530
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,359
logistical nightmare at that time to do

1531
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,359
it at a very local like in a simple

1532
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,440
level so we kind of dropped the idea

1533
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,400
what we started doing is more uh meetups

1534
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,200
uh

1535
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,599
something that we call rfcs we love we

1536
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,680
kind of invited people that if you have

1537
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,599
some ideas come and talk

1538
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,079
about what you are doing in itf even if

1539
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,440
something that you have implemented so

1540
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,839
we got some implementers whoever

1541
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,480
talking now about the hybrid model uh uh

1542
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,480
and uh even what we were talking about

1543
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,680
with uh

1544
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,480
uh

1545
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,920
with gather

1546
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,680
in my area what i've seen is like you

1547
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,359
know i think we need some kind of

1548
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,760
forcing function like organize some

1549
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,799
event

1550
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:42,400
something to make people come there

1551
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,920
because i know so many people i talk to

1552
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,280
like meet me and gathers like oh i don't

1553
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,200
have time for that there's so i have a

1554
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,799
busy week

1555
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,720
i want to go do things so even if it's

1556
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,359
some technical like hot rfc was a pretty

1557
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:55,520
good thing that we did in gather

1558
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,799
something like that even if working

1559
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,400
group chairs can organize something okay

1560
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,319
we'll be reviewing this draft which is

1561
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,079
next in isg so if anybody has any

1562
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,240
concerns let's go and meet

1563
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,559
and force people to use that i think it

1564
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:09,119
i i see some potential there it would be

1565
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,520
good to like you know we find some ways

1566
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,640
to make that work thank you

1567
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,040
um so about the hub experience i think

1568
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,480
it would be super because i have like no

1569
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,359
experience with that and like in i'm

1570
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:22,960
assuming that you now talk about the hub

1571
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,319
where there was actually a meeting

1572
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:25,920
during the meeting right other talked

1573
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,200
about perhaps where there were pre or

1574
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,040
site meetings or whatever so writing

1575
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,799
down your experience for others to learn

1576
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,160
from it would be very useful i think

1577
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,599
thanks

1578
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,760
thanks stuff

1579
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,760
when um

1580
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,680
i i think one of the challenges for me

1581
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,760
on like one of these hub things is as i

1582
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,760
think other people said like

1583
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,960
ultimately you're there but then

1584
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,240
everyone goes off in eight different

1585
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,400
rooms or just gets on their laptop which

1586
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,880
is not awesome um

1587
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,480
you may be separating out the plenary as

1588
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,400
we do this time is an opportunity to

1589
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,960
gather everyone for a single event so

1590
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,880
all the bay area people could get

1591
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,559
together and watch the plenary and then

1592
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:04,319
have some position something like that

1593
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:08,759
might work i don't know just thought

1594
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,119
are you just coming up as a chair or

1595
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:24,799
um i was just going to suggest maybe

1596
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:28,160
that there's a actual section on hubs

1597
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:28,960
um

1598
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,880
that that may be where both

1599
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,799
driven i could put our

1600
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:35,200
um text but anyway

1601
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,359
actually as a chair

1602
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:40,160
to accept a text but it seems like this

1603
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,520
is a bigger topic that might need a

1604
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,680
different document a separate document

1605
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,839
to be

1606
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,000
no um so do the chairs want to consider

1607
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,599
an adoption call or what's the next step

1608
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:05,839
for us

1609
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,400
this week

1610
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,559
search is breaking up a little bit for

1611
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:14,880
me is that just me

1612
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,880
i i think

1613
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,559
adoption called next week on the mailing

1614
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,680
list

1615
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,680

i can see him here you see him great

1626
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,839
all right so this is about uh the draft

1627
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,319
on uh running an ietf hackathon

1628
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:16,400
uh just to give you an update on uh

1629
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,359
where we're at with it

1630
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,040
so

1631
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,799
uh just

1632
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:25,040
maybe for those of you who this draft

1633
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,400
might be a little bit new just a quick

1634
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,720
recap what the draft is about

1635
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,079
um

1636
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,079
it's about running an ihf hackathon and

1637
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:34,000
those are two to encourage

1638
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,040
um the itf community to come together to

1639
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,520
collaborate on code and code that's

1640
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,520
related to the work we're doing in the

1641
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,839
ietf around you know the drafts that

1642
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:45,839
we're working on

1643
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,760
and

1644
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,799
this

1645
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:51,200
this document is to provide some

1646
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,119
practices around how to run those those

1647
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:54,960
ietf hackathons

1648
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,319
um

1649
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:57,760
it uh

1650
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,839
you know the hackathon started out as i

1651
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:01,520
mean as the itf meetings this in-person

1652
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,280
events but we've always had remote

1653
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,839
participation very similar to itf

1654
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:07,280
meetings in general

1655
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,839
and then because of the pandemic we had

1656
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:12,400
to adapt to running hackathons online

1657
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,480
only so this draft covers both

1658
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,000
as opposed to what you just saw with the

1659
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,359
previous draft which just really

1660
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:20,799
focusing on

1661
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:23,520
online only this draft covers both

1662
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,280
that you know all aspects of the

1663
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,280
hackathon whether it's in person

1664
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,359
or

1665
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:32,000
online only and also to that extent that

1666
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,319
the hybrid aspect because basically all

1667
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:36,079
all hackathons have always been hybrid

1668
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:37,680
but maybe we'll have a little bit more

1669
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,160
about that

1670
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,039
so we started working group last call

1671
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:48,799
after iatf after the last ietf meeting

1672
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:51,280
and uh thanks to those who uh reviewed

1673
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,359
and you know there was a lot of good

1674
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:54,480
feedback

1675
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,160
mostly positive actually i think all

1676
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,720
positive over pointing out some

1677
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,039
some issues that could be raised

1678
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:03,440
and so what i did for tracking these was

1679
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,640
i entered them all as issues in github

1680
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,559
and then started uh working through them

1681
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,799
there

1682
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,160
and basically oh sorry let me go back

1683
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,440
all those were um resolved

1684
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,359
and um

1685
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:21,520
and then a new version of the draft was

1686
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,200
produced unfortunately i couldn't get

1687
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,400
that done

1688
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,400
in time for the the deadline for

1689
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,799
submitting drafts for this ietf meeting

1690
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:30,880
but i i just posted it a few days ago

1691
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,880
hopefully you saw that on the list even

1692
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,559
if you haven't had a chance to review it

1693
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:35,440
yet

1694
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,359
um yeah i'd appreciate it if you would

1695
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:40,160
take a look um i know i worked with all

1696
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,920
the submitters of the issues to make

1697
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,480
sure that this draft

1698
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,400
resolved their concerns

1699
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,480
but then what i want to do now is just

1700
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,119
run over a few things which were a

1701
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,039
little bit more substantial changes just

1702
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,039
to bring them to everyone's attention

1703
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,720
and provide that opportunity for

1704
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,839
additional feedback

1705
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,000
um so the first thing was around

1706
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,839
something new that's been developed

1707
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:06,799
really

1708
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:09,839
as a result of the pandemic and that's

1709
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:12,160
what we refer to as hacknet and this is

1710
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,039
for remote networking so that when

1711
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:17,280
you're

1712
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:21,440
online here you can still connect to

1713
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,319
an ietf network or a virtual ietf

1714
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,280
network

1715
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,400
and that's really important for the

1716
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,240
hackathon or at least some hackathon

1717
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,359
projects

1718
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:30,240
that

1719
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,920
that really need that idea of like

1720
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,920
connecting everyone in the group

1721
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,000
connecting their devices you know

1722
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,480
together on a common uh layer 2 network

1723
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,359
so

1724
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:43,440
hack.net provides that and that's been a

1725
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,079
great thing we certainly plan to

1726
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:48,960
continue to use that

1727
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,799
even as we return back to in-person

1728
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:53,280
meetings as a way to enable people who

1729
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,880
are remote to

1730
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,960
join the ietf network

1731
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,839
and so um i've documented that before

1732
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:02,480
but the concern was uh that you know

1733
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,240
this is still very experimental and

1734
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,079
although it's worked great i think we've

1735
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:08,400
enjoyed using it for the hackathon the

1736
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,920
noc folks who are

1737
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,599
supporting it mentioned like hey you

1738
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:14,240
know we want everyone to know that this

1739
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,480
is still an experimental thing so

1740
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,960
um text for that effect has been added

1741
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,280
into the end of the draft just to set

1742
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,480
expectations around it

1743
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,599
okay i'll move to the next thing

1744
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,480
um

1745
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,799
nesting was around also with hack.net i

1746
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:35,200
think dhruv pointed out well you know

1747
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,599
yeah that's great but what about

1748
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,079
additional um security considerations

1749
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,079
that may come into play as a result of

1750
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:43,039
that

1751
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,720
we had some considerations around

1752
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,760
privacy but nothing around uh security

1753
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,839
and and so that was a really good point

1754
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:52,240
and i'm glad to phrase that

1755
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:52,960
so

1756
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,119
um you can see what we've added here

1757
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:56,720
that um

1758
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,039
yes it is kind of opening up a new

1759
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,599
vector for for potential attacks and

1760
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:05,280
misuse of the ietf network being able to

1761
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,839
join remotely however we do have

1762
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:11,280
some mechanisms in place you

1763
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,440
your access is tied to your data tracker

1764
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,400
account

1765
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,599
so at least we we know who is accessing

1766
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:20,480
and then you know as at any ietf meeting

1767
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,480
we always try to keep the ietf network

1768
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,240
as open as possible

1769
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,920
and that probably makes it a little bit

1770
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,880
more subject to potential attacks but we

1771
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,359
also just rely on ietf you know the

1772
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:34,640
community that's uh at a meeting to to

1773
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,720
respect the ietf network

1774
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,480
and that's actually worked out pretty

1775
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,640
well for us but in the event anything

1776
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,200
did go wrong we would treat

1777
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,160
um

1778
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,240
sort of misuse of the ietf network

1779
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,640
through hacknet the same as we would if

1780
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,960
a person at an in-person meeting

1781
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,359
was misusing the ietf network and

1782
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:56,319
address it that way

1783
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,760
and then the last thing um

1784
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,000
drew also pointed out that

1785
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,240
uh you know there's a ton of

1786
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,039
basically links to you know references

1787
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:11,760
whether it be wiki pages or web pages

1788
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,599
um things on the internet within the

1789
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:14,559
draft

1790
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,960
and i had just included these all as

1791
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,200
inline sort of things using you know

1792
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,440
with using markdown

1793
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,559
um

1794
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:24,160
and so the thought was well hey these

1795
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,160
should probably be informative

1796
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,920
references so i added an informative

1797
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,520
reference section

1798
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,000
and uh you can see the way i've uh gone

1799
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,640
about doing this i just uh basically the

1800
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:37,119
the text that i had in the draft i made

1801
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,839
as the title and then the the target is

1802
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:42,480
is the url where

1803
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,240
the things appear

1804
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,480
um i don't know if i actually did this

1805
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,359
correctly and if people on in this

1806
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:50,559
meeting now

1807
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:52,960
uh take a look and have a some thoughts

1808
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,559
about maybe uh

1809
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,640
is this appropriate use of informational

1810
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,400
references is there a better way to go

1811
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,160
about this perhaps i should have done

1812
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,160
something different with the title

1813
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,200
um

1814
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,119
i'd be happy to hear that

1815
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:07,200
i'm also planning on if i don't get any

1816
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,680
other feedback i'll take it to the uh

1817
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,160
maybe the tools discuss list just to let

1818
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,160
them know hey this is what i've done did

1819
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,640
i mess up and you have a better idea

1820
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,759
so um

1821
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:21,719
thoughts on that would be appreciated

1822
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:27,600
and uh

1823
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,120
the next step

1824
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,158
um

1825
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:31,679
you know there's just that one thing

1826
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:34,319
with the the references that i think

1827
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,319
needs to probably could use some

1828
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:38,319
improving other than that though i think

1829
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:40,719
it's ready to progress the draft

1830
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:42,158
i hope people get a chance to take a

1831
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:44,238
look at it and provide review comments

1832
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:45,198
and

1833
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:47,759
of course any feedback now or questions

1834
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:51,560
now would be great too

1835
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,279
charles and uh

1836
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:03,279
the goal is to ship as possible

1837
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,120
i think you said uh suresh the goal is

1838
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,238
to uh progress this draft as soon as

1839
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:13,439
possible kind of get it done

1840
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:16,399
is that what you said

1841
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:18,560
that would be my goal um

1842
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,640
i wasn't sure i heard you right kind of

1843
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,920
the audio cut out for me

1844
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,600
okay

1845
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:31,839
um if no one's coming to the queue or

1846
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:33,920
has questions uh i guess i'm done that

1847
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,480
was my last slide

1848
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:51,279
all right

1849
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:53,600
thanks

1850
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,600
i'm i'm having some audio issues not

1851
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,400
sure why

1852
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,800
but there is like a recharger text

1853
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,400
that's

1854
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,239
almost finals and i'll send a mail to

1855
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:10,759
the mailing just to get it kicked off

1856
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:27,679
uh yeah we heard we heard you okay um

1857
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:31,199
suresh but it was just a little soft

1858
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:32,239
but yeah

1859
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:35,040
just reiterate there is rechartered text

1860
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,320
it's going to go to the mailing list

1861
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,120
cancellation somehow just seems to be

1862
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,000
off for some reason

1863
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:01,199
okay there's nobody in the cube

1864
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,799
go ahead charles

1865
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,960
yeah so uh regarding the rechartering

1866
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,520
text uh i i had a look at it and it

1867
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,000
seemed like like several people did uh

1868
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,320
review it there within the google daca

1869
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,400
but in terms of the the next step to i

1870
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,800
mean do we think it's ready

1871
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,719
that this group needs to review it more

1872
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:30,080
or is it like

1873
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,920
you know ready to take it as a proposed

1874
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,199
recharter to the isg or i wasn't quite

1875
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:37,360
clear on if you're looking for more

1876
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,679
feedback and how

1877
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:41,840
yeah good question good question it

1878
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,679
means there's a there's an echo for me

1879
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,960
um

1880
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:52,239
i'm just gonna mute you um yeah that um

1881
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:54,400
i think this was a suresh and i took all

1882
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,239
the changes people had put in before we

1883
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:57,840
created a new

1884
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,400
draft version but it's worth folks

1885
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,159
commenting on the list before it goes

1886
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:05,040
um

1887
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,960
for a final recharter but so yeah look

1888
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,400
out for it on the list but i think it's

1889
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,600
actually in

1890
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,440
really good shape there's no outstanding

1891
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,280
questions that i can think to present to

1892
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,800
you right now about it

1893
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,159
so yeah suresh is going to email the

1894
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:18,400
list

1895
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,840
you can put yourself

1896
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:24,080
back okay i i was happy with uh with the

1897
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,560
text that was was in there i mean the

1898
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,920
one thing i thought about was i didn't

1899
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,239
know if we wanted to call out specific

1900
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:32,239
sort of deliverables or

1901
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:35,280
drafts that we think it does provide

1902
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,199
like the types of drafts

1903
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:39,280
um the types of things that need to be

1904
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,199
covered but maybe if um

1905
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:42,560
that was the only thing i thought of is

1906
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,760
if we wanted to add a little more

1907
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,760
specificity around that

1908
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,080
i recall that being there so i don't

1909
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,920
know if i don't have if you have

1910
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,320
specific suggestions around throughout

1911
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,800
the situation okay maybe

1912
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,600
was it like okay i'll take a look again

1913
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,199
i didn't remember seeing

1914
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:00,960
that but okay

1915
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,320
it was there before and i don't think we

1916
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:05,360
removed it so okay but maybe your level

1917
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,120
of specificity is different which is why

1918
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:10,159
proposed changes be fine

1919
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:11,679
okay

1920
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,080
yeah miriah

1921
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,840
yeah i'm wondering if we should just use

1922
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,600
the time and bring the charter up on the

1923
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,600
screen and talk a little bit about the

1924
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,440
things that have changed from the

1925
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:29,799
previous charter so everybody's on board

1926
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,719
uh yeah we could do that um

1927
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:38,320
just i've done

1928
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,880
it exactly for that media and i'll ship

1929
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,560
it up to the list right like it's kind

1930
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,040
of hard to go through

1931
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,440
so there's three classes of changes in

1932
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,800
there

1933
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,600
so one of them is to remove the

1934
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,840
cove related stuff

1935
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,480
and make it a bit more general

1936
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,480
and the second thing is adding hybrid

1937
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,719
media principles

1938
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,360
and third thing is really changing the

1939
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:07,799
meeting feed not into a bcp

1940
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,159
charles or mariette are you back in the

1941
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:45,440
queue because you want to speak you can

1942
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:49,120
just go off my you can go on mike and

1943
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,840
thanks for dropping the link in the chat

1944
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,360
go ahead

1945
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,760
i'm looking at the text now i was i'm

1946
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,239
actually wondering if what ted proposed

1947
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:27,840
earlier as a more a high level

1948
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,840
recommendation which is somehow related

1949
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,679
to tooling but probably not just like

1950
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:33,600
how to incentivize more socializing for

1951
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,840
example if that would still be in scope

1952
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:39,520
or not um because we have this one point

1953
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,000
about planning fully online meetings but

1954
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,760
that point is mostly focusing on

1955
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,679
scheduling aspects

1956
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:46,480
um

1957
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,760
so

1958
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,880
i guess

1959
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,080
it's either

1960
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,440
either question to the chairs and the

1961
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,040
idea of that would be in scope or a

1962
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,719
proposal that we add like a small thing

1963
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:57,280
there as well

1964
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,120
i think it's okay to be ambiguous if

1965
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,120
it's not obviously out of scope then i

1966
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,880
don't feel like we need to make a change

1967
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,440
and if it it's something that we we feel

1968
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,199
is important and i think

1969
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:12,400
if

1970
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,760
somebody wanted to write that down i

1971
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,800
know ted

1972
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,159
was saying supposedly doesn't have the

1973
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:17,520
time to do it but

1974
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,199
if someone feels strongly enough about

1975
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,120
writing something about social

1976
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,480
interaction then

1977
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,239
if it isn't explicitly out of scope with

1978
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:25,760
this charter i think that's a good thing

1979
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,840
it means that there can be some

1980
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,440
experimentation and suggestions around

1981
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,760
that that's how i feel but

1982
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,280
if

1983
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,600
we put it in the charter explicitly then

1984
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,199
does it feel like

1985
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,600
an imperative to address the social i

1986
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,920
don't know

1987
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,719
we just uh to add to that um i think for

1988
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:50,159
me it probably would also be hard to put

1989
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:52,080
something in without actually seeing it

1990
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,440
and understanding what the draft would

1991
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,839
be seeing

1992
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:01,080
indeed i agree with that

1993
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,800
okay i'm just rounding out notes um

1994
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,840
i encourage everybody um who's who's

1995
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,600
spoken today um i didn't capture a lot

1996
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,560
of the

1997
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,400
discussion in the chat and the notes but

1998
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,719
i think for the most part it's they're

1999
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:28,560
thorough so but you can go ahead and

2000
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,679
check them

2001
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:33,440
make changes before we finalize

2002
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:35,280
and yeah there's nobody else in the

2003
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,120
queue so i think we might be

2004
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:40,920
we might be done for today

2005
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,320
okay

2006
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:55,280
yeah nick go ahead

2007
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,640
yeah just to bring something that i was

2008
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,880
uh mentioning in the chat there was this

2009
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,480
draft from

2010
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,400
elliott lear who i think isn't here uh

2011
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,159
we got to stop meeting like this

2012
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:08,080
suggesting that we should

2013
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:12,400
or the llc or someone should investigate

2014
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,120
changing the in-person meeting cadence

2015
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,480
because of the

2016
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,080
costs of

2017
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,840
very regular in-person meetings

2018
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,280
and i'm just looking at the charter i

2019
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,280
certainly think that is in scope at

2020
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,040
least under the

2021
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,120
revised charter although maybe

2022
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,360
maybe it's not very emphasized like it

2023
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,280
says that one work item is

2024
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,840
will consider the cadence of mostly

2025
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:40,199
in-person meetings um

2026
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:43,679
i i guess i hope we could uh

2027
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:45,280
uh

2028
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,679
like emphasize that or change that more

2029
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:50,400
substantially um but it just seems in

2030
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:54,280
scope to me so what i'm saying

2031
01:18:58,159 --> 01:18:58,960
right

2032
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,719
yeah yeah it isn't it isn't scope i

2033
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:03,440
think and um so the isg and the iab and

2034
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,040
the llc we discussed this a little bit

2035
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,520
on a workshop we had a

2036
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,360
virtual workshop we had a few a few

2037
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,080
weeks ago and um so generally the

2038
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,360
feeling was that

2039
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,520
because of covet and this long string of

2040
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,040
fully online meetings

2041
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,120
it's not actually clear if this is sort

2042
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,640
of something we want to do right away

2043
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,960
in the sense that we are just trying to

2044
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,760
build back to go into some in-person uh

2045
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,440
capability and um

2046
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,280
immediately thinking about you know

2047
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:34,480
should we change the cadence and the

2048
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,080
type of meetings we have now after

2049
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,480
kovitz seemed like something that was

2050
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,800
very difficult to imagine um the other

2051
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,800
thing where we are sort of a little all

2052
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,159
over the place is

2053
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:45,600
um you know

2054
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,600
what what do we

2055
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,719
think

2056
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:50,239
what would that look like so would we

2057
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:52,719
replace one of the three meetings or

2058
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:54,159
at least one of the three meetings with

2059
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:56,320
the fully online meeting would we add

2060
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,640
fully online meetings to the year

2061
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,320
um

2062
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,840
and and so if there were you

2063
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,600
know people that felt that adding

2064
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,600
meetings would just make the year too

2065
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,440
busy with too much itf stuff going on

2066
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,960
especially since there's also interim

2067
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,000
meetings

2068
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
replacing one of the three with a fully

2069
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,080
online meeting the feeling was that you

2070
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:16,960
know

2071
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,639
which one and why and they're already

2072
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:20,960
sort of rare enough that uh

2073
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,360
uh you know spacing them out further

2074
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,560
would be

2075
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,800
maybe difficult to do but um so so we

2076
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,800
were sort of basically decided to punt

2077
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,639
this forward and and

2078
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:33,360
worry about this um

2079
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,159
as we sort of ramp back up from corbett

2080
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:38,080
but all that said right if if the

2081
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,520
community wants to discuss this it's

2082
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,280
certainly in scope and i think if there

2083
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,800
would be some sort of consensus or at

2084
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,080
least an indication of consensus

2085
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,400
expressed i think that might be helpful

2086
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:50,159
um but in like in the isg and ibn llc we

2087
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:52,159
didn't have that uh when we discussed

2088
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:54,400
this

2089
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,520
that's useful context thanks i i think

2090
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,840
it's an ideal time to consider it i

2091
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:02,719
think

2092
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:03,840
um

2093
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,840
we have an opportunity now that remote

2094
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,239
people aren't second class citizens

2095
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,400
uh because we've all had to be like this

2096
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,639
is an opportunity to not go back to okay

2097
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:13,840
well let's make them second class

2098
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,920
citizens again for a few years and then

2099
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,560
we can talk about switching i'd rather

2100
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,320
we just not go back to second class

2101
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,320
citizenship

2102
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,080
andrew go ahead

2103
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,560
yeah just a quick comment

2104
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,239
uh

2105
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:46,800
one observation from the last uh couple

2106
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,000
of years i

2107
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,120
i think has underlined why

2108
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,400
for for those people that are lucky

2109
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,239
enough to be to be able to participate

2110
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:55,520
in person

2111
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,400
why that's important and and does make a

2112
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,840
big difference

2113
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:00,960
um

2114
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:04,159
notwithstanding improving the uh

2115
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:06,239
remote experience

2116
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:07,679
there's a lot of learnings from the last

2117
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:09,679
two years which mean that going forward

2118
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:12,880
the the remote experience could and

2119
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,480
should be a lot better than perhaps it

2120
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,840
it was

2121
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,199
previously

2122
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:19,120
um and then as a quicker side without

2123
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,000
going too far off into other matters

2124
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,360
for those people more concerned about

2125
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,440
the carbon footprint of in person

2126
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,400
um

2127
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,199
in my opinion i think the

2128
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:30,719
the community will be better off looking

2129
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:32,639
at the carbon footprint of of its

2130
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:35,920
protocols and protocol changes

2131
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,920
which probably have a far more

2132
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,480
significant uh sort of uh

2133
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:43,520
impact on on the world's sort of carbon

2134
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,639
footprint than a few people attending

2135
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:48,880
meetings each year

2136
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,880
but that probably is a whole different

2137
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,480
conversation than the one here

2138
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:07,199
thanks um

2139
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:09,760
if again like you know um

2140
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,080
just like cut in for a second and uh

2141
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,000
sorry john like the idea is not to go

2142
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,760
through it just to kind of show you like

2143
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,760
it's a extensive change in the chatter i

2144
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,120
did send the

2145
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,719
uh link

2146
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:22,159
to the um

2147
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:24,880
it's in the chat so if you can go in and

2148
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,800
click on it like you know uh just go

2149
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,560
ahead and look at it at your leisure

2150
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,520
like this is not to finalize it today so

2151
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,120
sorry about that i just wanted like i

2152
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,639
think somebody proposed to bring it up

2153
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:36,639
and take a look i think it was media so

2154
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:38,560
i just like uh brought it up right like

2155
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,880
but uh yeah absolutely the idea is not

2156
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:41,679
to

2157
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:43,920
um litigate this now because it's it

2158
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,080
doesn't make sense to uh do it online on

2159
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:48,400
this so we had like probably like a

2160
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,159
month of open period like where people

2161
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:51,679
could go and comment and like a lot of

2162
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:55,280
people did so we can probably have some

2163
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,159
um small cool off period before we ship

2164
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:01,440
it off to lars um i would say

2165
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,760
uh would a week uh be good enough for

2166
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:07,280
you lars to um like uh set off as a

2167
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,120
cooling period so people can

2168
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,040
um fight their idea fatigue and then

2169
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:14,159
like you know work on it next week

2170
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:15,600
yeah that would be fine for me so so

2171
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,199
this is basically for the working group

2172
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:18,960
to decide when they have text that they

2173
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,800
consider stable and then i'll stick it

2174
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,199
in the data trigger and start the formal

2175
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:24,560
thing

2176
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,960
yep sounds good so um thank you very

2177
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:27,840
much

2178
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:30,400
uh jay please go ahead thanks

2179
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:34,239
thanks so on this question of um uh

2180
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:36,880
regularly meeting offline um sorry

2181
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,639
online not in person

2182
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:41,679
uh a few things so what data we have

2183
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:43,600
shows that people strongly prefer

2184
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,040
meeting in person

2185
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,880
and are

2186
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,719
experiencing adverse effects from not

2187
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:50,560
meeting in person

2188
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,840
so whenever we do a survey after a

2189
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,840
one of the fully online meetings

2190
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,120
it's full of comments from people

2191
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,400
lamenting the fact that they're not

2192
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,679
meeting in in person

2193
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,400
secondly it's it's not actually more

2194
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,920
expensive for us to run um an on-site

2195
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,159
one compared to an in-person one because

2196
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:13,520
they're both relatively cost neutral

2197
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:14,960
obviously it's more expensive for

2198
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:18,239
attendees and for sponsors the sponsors

2199
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:20,320
are quite comfortable with that

2200
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:25,040
and i suspect the attendees by large are

2201
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,360
next thing is we've started doing carbon

2202
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,000
calculations for um

2203
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,400
on-site meetings in person meetings the

2204
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,679
last time we had one and we have a

2205
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:35,440
process set up to do that again when we

2206
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,960
go back to that

2207
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,880
and we've started looking at carbon

2208
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:42,400
credits or carbon offsetting anyway

2209
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,239
the we haven't done anything about that

2210
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,000
because we haven't been expecting to

2211
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,239
meet in person for quite some time but

2212
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:50,480
um it looks as though that's perfectly

2213
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,480
possible for us to do within the cost of

2214
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,120
a meeting to do carbon or setting now

2215
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,560
obviously that's not as good as not

2216
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,960
traveling in the first place but

2217
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,120
it's something a bit better

2218
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,440
and then finally the bit about being

2219
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,639
second class so um a lot of work is

2220
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:10,239
going in to try to prevent

2221
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:11,280
the

2222
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,520
remote experience being

2223
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:16,800
second class compared to the

2224
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,880
in-person on-site experience

2225
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,320
so

2226
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,000
that's through the technology so we have

2227
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,400
a new version of meet echo coming which

2228
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,440
um

2229
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:29,120
uh well would anyway there are various

2230
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,400
things going on there that we're aiming

2231
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,840
to do to try to adjust that um such as a

2232
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,360
single queue for example and those

2233
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,360
things it obviously a lot of that comes

2234
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:40,560
down to the behavior of people within

2235
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,920
uh the who are on site um as to how they

2236
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,360
are willing to accommodate people who

2237
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,120
are off site so we can only sell some of

2238
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,440
it with technology but i'm detaining to

2239
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,280
do that and of course the other problem

2240
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:54,639
is um time zones that um we have to

2241
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:56,239
decide when we go back to these if we're

2242
01:26:56,239 --> 01:26:57,679
still going to have a six hour meeting

2243
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:59,280
or if we go back to an eight or nine

2244
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,960
hour meeting because that would be much

2245
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:04,400
more difficult for participants so um

2246
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,800
you know there are

2247
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,320
as i said basically there are a lot of

2248
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,239
reasons why people want to meet again in

2249
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:12,800
person and a lot of work taking place to

2250
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,760
mitigate the impact of meeting in person

2251
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,760
thanks

2252
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,040
uh last like you were in queue like did

2253
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:25,280
you want to say something uh related to

2254
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:26,560
this or do you think

2255
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:29,120
is that what i what i wanted to say

2256
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:32,159
okay thank you phil go ahead

2257
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:35,040
yeah i just wanted to say that

2258
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,920
yes i do want to meet in person

2259
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,080
i don't necessarily want to meet in

2260
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:41,840
person

2261
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,239
more than once a year

2262
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:45,120
and

2263
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:48,159
you know well my my kids are will be in

2264
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:50,080
college very soon one's not already

2265
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,120
there

2266
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,280
when my kids were younger

2267
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:56,080
uh doing three meetings a year was well

2268
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,840
i never did it actually i never did more

2269
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,679
than two

2270
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:01,679
meetings a year

2271
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:03,280
um

2272
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,920
the other thing that i think i

2273
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,560
we assume that the itf meeting structure

2274
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,560
really works at all

2275
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,120
i think it obviously doesn't because

2276
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:15,920
to participate meaningfully in any

2277
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,520
working group meeting

2278
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:20,000
you have to read the drafts

2279
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,280
over an itf meeting week i usually do at

2280
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,760
least 12

2281
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:26,840
working

2282
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:30,239
groups reading the drafts for 12

2283
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:32,880
working groups is in itself a huge

2284
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,239
undertaking

2285
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:36,000
which i could only do because i was

2286
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,400
permanent research staff

2287
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,840
um

2288
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,600
i don't think that most people can do

2289
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,199
that

2290
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:45,760
and i don't think that

2291
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,719
the itf meeting structure really

2292
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:50,239
relates to

2293
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:52,320
how i would want to do work as an

2294
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,840
engineer if i designed the process from

2295
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:57,679
scratch finally on the carbon offsets

2296
01:28:57,679 --> 01:28:59,360
thing

2297
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:02,320
the reason that you make

2298
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,639
a symbolic gesture

2299
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,239
on carbon

2300
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:07,360
emissions

2301
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,040
is to remind yourself that it's

2302
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,199
important so it's not

2303
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:13,120
i mean we've never talked about the

2304
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:17,199
carbon uh cost of our protocols before

2305
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:19,679
the reason for starting to

2306
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:22,080
to making a symbolic gesture

2307
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:25,440
in terms of how we do our own work

2308
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:28,000
is to remind ourselves

2309
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,639
that that is important

2310
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:34,560
that said if you look at the um

2311
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,600
aviation fuel is mostly kerosene

2312
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,159
if you look at the consumption of

2313
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:41,920
kerosene globally

2314
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,679
it turns out that

2315
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:47,520
over half of it goes into lighting

2316
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,520
kerosene lightens

2317
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:52,400
it's expensive it's dangerous

2318
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:54,880
it's poor lighting

2319
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,600
if we just gave everybody led

2320
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,120
lamps and

2321
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:00,880
solar panels

2322
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:04,080
we could do that within five years

2323
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,000
and we wouldn't need to change we would

2324
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
have the same effect of converting every

2325
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,920
jet

2326
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:10,719
so

2327
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:13,120
offsets are the way to go

2328
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,480
but um

2329
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,400
it's complicated

2330
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:20,199
i just want to say

2331
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:23,920
thanks phil um i i think like one of the

2332
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:26,159
things that you brought up right it's

2333
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:27,440
kind of a bit

2334
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:29,440
relevant here and i don't know if you

2335
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,280
that's what you meant phil but like you

2336
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:33,280
know um you said this is not how you

2337
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:34,480
want to work i think some people have

2338
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,719
suggested uh like a whole bunch of

2339
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:38,480
interest is the way to go right and that

2340
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,239
could probably

2341
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:42,080
help with your like read too many drafts

2342
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:45,040
thing if it's like offset in time but

2343
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,480
there was a proposal i think from

2344
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,159
michael and and media that's

2345
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:51,519
incorporated into the charter

2346
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,960
yeah go ahead chris thanks

2347
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,679
yeah i mentioned this in the chat but um

2348
01:30:57,679 --> 01:30:58,880
you know certainly looking at the

2349
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,199
in-person meeting cost of the carbon i

2350
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:04,080
mean how do you factor in uh the benefit

2351
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,920
that the work we

2352
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,800
do at the ietf right i mean we empower a

2353
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,760
lot of remote work right there's a huge

2354
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,480
um i think multiplicative

2355
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,560
benefit from what we do so even though

2356
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,400
we might burn some carbon getting in

2357
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,960
person if we work really effectively

2358
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,520
uh the benefit uh and the reduction of

2359
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,679
carbon across the globe you know from

2360
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:28,320
remote work and and things like that

2361
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,400
uh i think it's probably multiplicative

2362
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,560
right and so i i don't think we should

2363
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,480
get into counting numbers too much uh

2364
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,560
in that particular sense

2365
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,760
um and into what phil said um he did say

2366
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,760
i a few times but there were a few like

2367
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,840
things he said that were like sort of

2368
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,120
statements about ietf i mean i find it

2369
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,560
very effective

2370
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,480
three times a year right so i mean i

2371
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:54,320
guess you have to balance that right

2372
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:55,920
some people it works some people it

2373
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:58,920
doesn't

2374
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:04,480
yeah thanks chris thank you

2375
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:10,120
jay go ahead

2376
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,880
and elite go ahead if jay comes back

2377
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:23,600
we'll go ahead

2378
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:26,960
hi everybody

2379
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:28,880
um

2380
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:32,159
well hey hey suresh and i can see that

2381
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:34,000
christian's doing his part because he

2382
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,679
you know in terms of saving carbon

2383
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:36,960
because he clearly doesn't have the heat

2384
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,199
on in his house he's got that jacket on

2385
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:40,719
um

2386
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:42,080
well it's

2387
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:45,440
been quite uh a while since i published

2388
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,199
draft we are we got to start meeting

2389
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:49,840
like we got to stop meeting like this

2390
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,000
if ever there was a draft that was

2391
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,320
overtaken by events

2392
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,400
that was the one

2393
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:56,810
um

2394
01:32:56,810 --> 01:32:58,560
[Music]

2395
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,000
just a couple of

2396
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,040
brief comments and i'll move on

2397
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,600
first of all thank you jay uh thank you

2398
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,040
very much jay uh for uh collecting

2399
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,120
uh the information

2400
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,639
um

2401
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:15,280
the draft that i wrote was not intended

2402
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,840
to be prescriptive in terms of

2403
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:20,880
any any particular solution

2404
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,840
um but rather

2405
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,480
for us to ponder

2406
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,239
our footprint our footprint on the

2407
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:29,520
planet

2408
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:32,719
um and to maybe consider getting us out

2409
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:34,159
of the mode

2410
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:36,239
of where we book five to seven years in

2411
01:33:36,239 --> 01:33:39,199
advance where it's almost impossible to

2412
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:41,440
run an experiment

2413
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,840
uh in terms of how we might restructure

2414
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:44,800
things

2415
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,960
um but to think it's but to get us into

2416
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,040
better position

2417
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,159
where we could try different modes

2418
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:53,280
of

2419
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,080
uh

2420
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,159
communication and

2421
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:58,159
uh collaboration

2422
01:33:58,159 --> 01:33:59,360
so

2423
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,560
now that

2424
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,560
i'm not even sure we can say we we we're

2425
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,960
seeing the end uh you know the light at

2426
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,320
the end of the tunnel yet here in europe

2427
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,080
the numbers are spiking again

2428
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:10,960
but assuming that day comes

2429
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,400
um

2430
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,880
my suggestion is we go back to

2431
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:17,120
this notion of trying a few different

2432
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:20,320
things and seeing what works

2433
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,840
i don't really want to sacrifice

2434
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:23,840
effectiveness either

2435
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,360
i can tell you

2436
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:28,000
from my own personal experience i'm sure

2437
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,080
everybody's different here but i don't

2438
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:33,440
feel as effective when i'm jet lagged

2439
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:36,159
so it could be that the costs are it's

2440
01:34:36,159 --> 01:34:37,520
very hard to account for all of these

2441
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,120
costs but the cost that i primarily

2442
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:40,719
wanted to account for was the one that

2443
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:41,520
my

2444
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,760
kid was sort of you know buttoning me

2445
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,920
with and saying hey you're becoming the

2446
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,960
problem in terms of carbon footprint

2447
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:50,639
so um

2448
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:52,880
that is one of the issues that i think

2449
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:55,760
is important and to the point that oh

2450
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,440
yeah well there's obviously a benefit of

2451
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:58,719
us getting together and meeting and

2452
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:01,440
being productive uh

2453
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,920
i'd be a little nervous about using that

2454
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,679
that that line because i think everybody

2455
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:07,119
would end up using it saying oh we're

2456
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:09,600
always benefiting the world by meeting

2457
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:11,360
and we're social people so we like to

2458
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,320
meet

2459
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,920
so the trick is to find the right

2460
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,159
balance anyway thanks for your patience

2461
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:16,880
and

2462
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:19,920
wish everybody a great day

2463
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,638
thank you

2464
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:29,199
did you want to chime in there

2465
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:31,760
hey yeah i i sort of want to um that was

2466
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,159
all great elliot but i sort of wonder if

2467
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:35,440
you wanted to

2468
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,360
if you had a concrete change in mind

2469
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:40,159
that that we sort of you think sort of

2470
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:41,679
we should do or that you think we should

2471
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:43,280
we could get consensus on because that's

2472
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,880
sort of where

2473
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,320
you know this this is sort of the step

2474
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:47,679
that i struggle with

2475
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:49,920
right sort of you know to go from the

2476
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,760
from the abstract to sort of a concrete

2477
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,679
thing that that we actually believe we

2478
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:56,000
can do because i think is sort of a

2479
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,960
little bit all over the place here

2480
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:12,320
okay

2481
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:13,520
um

2482
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,480
well thanks for the question lars um

2483
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,159
very classically

2484
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:20,639
you know the question i'm used to you

2485
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:22,800
asking that question at this point so i

2486
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,080
actually have a couple of concrete

2487
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,520
suggestions

2488
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:26,320
uh

2489
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:28,000
i'm going to go from a little bit

2490
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,560
abstract then into the concrete

2491
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,320
um

2492
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,800
at the abstract level i think we should

2493
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,960
um

2494
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,440
uh collect a number of possible

2495
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,880
approaches

2496
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:43,360
um that we could try

2497
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:44,480
um

2498
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:47,520
when i say try i mean not standardize on

2499
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:49,280
in terms of this is the way things will

2500
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:50,719
go in the future

2501
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:53,199
but i do mean try we don't have to try

2502
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:54,080
them

2503
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:56,239
every year but maybe

2504
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:58,560
we plan out a schedule of how we try

2505
01:36:58,560 --> 01:36:59,520
things

2506
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:00,719
so

2507
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:02,480
what does that mean concretely i'll give

2508
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:04,880
you a couple of examples that we could

2509
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:06,800
try

2510
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,960
the one that i like

2511
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,320
is

2512
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,440
going to

2513
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,600
um semi-annual meetings

2514
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,280
to try

2515
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:19,440
for a for plenary purposes

2516
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:23,520
and then load up with lots of interims

2517
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:27,199
and further in that period of time

2518
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:29,760
require that the interims not be in

2519
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,600
person

2520
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,440
in doing that the other there are a

2521
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,360
couple of variants on that

2522
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:37,040
one variant is

2523
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:40,560
instead of running a meeting for

2524
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,800
when we do the semi-annual we

2525
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,560
instead of running the meeting for and

2526
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:45,760
this is where things get a little

2527
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,280
interesting is how you calculate the

2528
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,280
beginning and the end of an ietf meeting

2529
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,920
but extend the meetings on

2530
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:56,159
on either side by a couple of days

2531
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:57,760
that would be one

2532
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,159
example of trying another

2533
01:38:00,159 --> 01:38:01,440
thing to try

2534
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,360
would be to

2535
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,239
uh

2536
01:38:04,239 --> 01:38:06,480
do semi-annual meetings again and

2537
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:07,600
actually after your clarification

2538
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,199
question on the first one so you're

2539
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:10,480
saying we think we should we should go

2540
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:13,040
to set a semi-annual sort of plenary but

2541
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,639
make it like one and a half weeks or

2542
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:17,440
something or two weeks yeah yeah yeah

2543
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:18,400
exactly

2544
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,560
okay thank you yeah

2545
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:21,920
another approach

2546
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:23,360
is to

2547
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:26,480
uh do a similar semi-annual

2548
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:29,199
uh activity but require

2549
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:31,280
um

2550
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:32,560
blocks

2551
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:34,400
if you will of

2552
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,239
um

2553
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:37,520
of of

2554
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,920
uh interim meetings that occur in person

2555
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,280
on the book ends

2556
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:44,080
uh on so if we're meeting and say i'll

2557
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:46,320
just pick two dates if we're meeting in

2558
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,280
um

2559
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:50,400
say march and november uh then require

2560
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,719
uh interim blocks

2561
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:54,400
in say july

2562
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:57,840
and uh december or something like that

2563
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:00,159
um maybe even it out a little bit so

2564
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:02,080
that it's a little bit more on the q on

2565
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:03,119
you know

2566
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:05,360
symmetrical so that would be another

2567
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,520
approach to try and i don't have a

2568
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,280
particularly strong

2569
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,639
you know

2570
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:12,400
direction to say let's do this first so

2571
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,000
let's do that first

2572
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,159
um but what i would like to do before we

2573
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:17,440
do any of them

2574
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:20,000
is at least do a calculation a rough

2575
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,040
sketch calculation as to which we think

2576
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,840
will have the most uh beneficial impact

2577
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:27,040
in terms of the environment so we have

2578
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:28,639
some understanding because last thing

2579
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:29,840
i'd like to do is try something that

2580
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,080
makes things worse for the environment

2581
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,199
and we could

2582
01:39:33,199 --> 01:39:35,199
absolutely do that

2583
01:39:35,199 --> 01:39:36,480
um

2584
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:37,440
you know

2585
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,440
i don't put it beyond us to to do that

2586
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,560
by accident

2587
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:41,760
uh so

2588
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,840
uh

2589
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,600
that's what that's one approach the uh

2590
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:47,760
you know a third try by the way would be

2591
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,280
to go annual

2592
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:51,440
meetings and make them every you know

2593
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,840
make make them for two weeks in light

2594
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:56,560
but do a lot more interims um

2595
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,320
i think that may be too radical for the

2596
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,080
community to be honest i think it's

2597
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:01,679
already pretty radical to swallow the

2598
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:04,239
idea of going semi-annual so those are

2599
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:06,239
just a couple of ideas

2600
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:08,480
but again i didn't mean to be at all

2601
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,639
prescriptive right these are just some

2602
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:13,040
things we we could evaluate and the

2603
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,600
intent that i had of asking jay to get

2604
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:18,320
the data and ask the llc to get the data

2605
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,400
was to help us calculate these things in

2606
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,480
terms of what would be beneficial

2607
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:23,920
and then present that back to the

2608
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:26,719
community as options of things to try

2609
01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:28,800
what i think is most important in the

2610
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,800
process though is to make sure from a

2611
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:34,159
contractual standpoint the llc sees that

2612
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:36,400
we're interested in doing these tries

2613
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,719
and thus allows for at a contractual

2614
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:41,440
level us to be able to to manage the

2615
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,760
hotels and things like that and i i

2616
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:45,600
don't want to discount the effort that's

2617
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,040
involved in that i'm sure that's a

2618
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,119
substantial challenge all right thanks

2619
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:51,839
again

2620
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,000
thanks elliot i think ian you're next

2621
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,960
thank you uh

2622
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:06,480
we can have all sorts of opinions about

2623
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:08,560
what is best for the environment and the

2624
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:11,679
planet and so on but a real fact of life

2625
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:13,280
for me is that

2626
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,520
my employer cisco

2627
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:16,560
has

2628
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,239
announced that they will be cutting

2629
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:20,400
travel expenses by 60

2630
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,400
going out of kovit

2631
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,480
and i heard ericsson say similar things

2632
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:26,320
from the ceo

2633
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:27,199
so

2634
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:28,960
no matter what i think

2635
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,560
it will not be possible for me to attend

2636
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,400
in person at least not in trans

2637
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:33,840
continental

2638
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:36,000
venues

2639
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,080
so it would be really nice if we could

2640
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:40,080
have

2641
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,560
no second level citizenship in the

2642
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,400
meetings if we are remote i don't think

2643
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,320
we need to change all that much you can

2644
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:47,840
have as many meetings as you want and so

2645
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,520
on but make sure that everybody who

2646
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,520
wants to pass his bait remotely can do

2647
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:54,320
so in a good way i don't want to be

2648
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,960
second rate

2649
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,400
thank you thank you

2650
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:03,839
thank you uh charles

2651
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:12,480
okay um yeah you know i think one of the

2652
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,159
things that's become clear through a lot

2653
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:15,679
of our discussions is that the way

2654
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:17,679
people interact with the itf really

2655
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:20,239
varies quite a lot and the people on

2656
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:23,199
this call are probably people who

2657
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:25,360
interact with the ietf

2658
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:26,800
a bit say

2659
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,840
more or more intensely than than people

2660
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:32,000
who perhaps aren't on this call but you

2661
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,520
know i think we need to keep in mind

2662
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:35,199
that there's that that spectrum we heard

2663
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:38,159
from php how even just within

2664
01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:40,960
his uh time working within the ietf how

2665
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,040
he participates as his change and his

2666
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:45,520
level of participation has changed and

2667
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,600
um so to me that the real thing for us

2668
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:50,960
to focus on would be the hybrid approach

2669
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:53,679
and looking to see you know let's keep

2670
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:55,920
the remote participation and let's

2671
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,719
continue to make improvements in how

2672
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:00,400
when you do attend the meeting remotely

2673
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,560
that that experience is good

2674
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:04,480
and you know i think what you'll find

2675
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:06,080
quite naturally as a result of that is

2676
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,159
you will have more remote attendees that

2677
01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:09,280
people will

2678
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:10,800
you always make that trade off do i

2679
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,560
travel to the meeting or do i attend

2680
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,400
remotely or do i not go at all right we

2681
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:17,040
all make that decision or we have uh for

2682
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:19,280
a number of years before covet and even

2683
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:21,040
with covet how much time do i devote to

2684
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:22,960
it but i think what you'll start to see

2685
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:25,280
is if the hybrid if the remote

2686
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:27,199
experience is good

2687
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:29,600
people will tend to use that a little

2688
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:32,800
bit more a little tip to where okay i

2689
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:35,040
can't or i don't want to travel there's

2690
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,280
only these few things i can do them

2691
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:39,840
remotely i don't need to be there

2692
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:42,080
we'll enable that decision or we'll make

2693
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,760
people uh more likely to make that

2694
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:46,239
decision and we'll improve the overall

2695
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:48,159
experience for for everyone if we do it

2696
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:50,639
carefully i think if we what we need to

2697
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:52,480
watch out for is that we don't mess up

2698
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:53,520
and

2699
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,199
everyone feels like they need to be at

2700
01:43:55,199 --> 01:43:57,040
the in-person meeting or else you know

2701
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,960
because remote's useless or

2702
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:01,280
alternatively we make the in-person

2703
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,360
meeting so bad because we optimize for

2704
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,119
remote experience that

2705
01:44:05,119 --> 01:44:07,040
no one shows up and then we say like oh

2706
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,639
we'll just meet online because we know

2707
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:10,719
that's not ideal either so

2708
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:12,400
i'm really trying to find that sweet

2709
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:14,000
spot with these experiments people have

2710
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,840
been mentioning i think that's great i'd

2711
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,920
like to see us go forward with that

2712
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,840
and then

2713
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:21,760
maybe after that give that a little bit

2714
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,719
time

2715
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:25,040
let that uh see some of the benefits of

2716
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:26,880
that and where we end up and then we

2717
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:29,119
could probably also meet you know in

2718
01:44:29,119 --> 01:44:31,280
person less often if

2719
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:33,440
the the whole hybrid experience or

2720
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,760
remote you know attendance thing is

2721
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:39,199
continues to get better as it has

2722
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,560
thanks

2723
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:44,320
thank you chels

2724
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:47,320
andrew

2725
01:44:48,159 --> 01:44:49,840
all right just picking up on the uh sort

2726
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:52,960
of discussion on on uh

2727
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:54,880
move to more interims

2728
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:57,600
um there's an observation i think if if

2729
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,840
if if the itf was to become much more

2730
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:04,560
interim so based that feels to me

2731
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:07,600
very divisive for the community

2732
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:08,639
um

2733
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:10,480
and

2734
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:13,119
so it depends whether you think the itf

2735
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:15,360
is a community or not so for some people

2736
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:17,679
that may not be a consideration

2737
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:18,800
um

2738
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:21,040
but if you like by

2739
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:22,400
putting

2740
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:25,520
much more stuff into very discreet silos

2741
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,600
um then you lose

2742
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,159
um the perspectives from people that

2743
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:31,440
perhaps

2744
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:33,199
aren't focused on solving a particular

2745
01:45:33,199 --> 01:45:34,560
problem but can bring a unique

2746
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,800
perspective to it because they happen to

2747
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:37,840
be

2748
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:41,600
a on-site um with a spare slot so so

2749
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,280
drop in um

2750
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:45,600
and i think that's less likely to happen

2751
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:49,119
if we've got you know a huge spread

2752
01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:51,119
of uh interims

2753
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:54,639
um i'd also worry

2754
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:57,360
that it will be harmful for diversity

2755
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,760
um if if there's a much greater use of

2756
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,760
of um interims

2757
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,840
because they tend and this is a

2758
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:05,040
generalism but i think if you look at

2759
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,040
the data it would be brutally supportive

2760
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:08,000
of this

2761
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,679
to be scheduled for the convenience of

2762
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:14,000
you know people currently involved in a

2763
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,159
particular working group

2764
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:18,400
so it makes it potentially a lot harder

2765
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:20,639
unintentionally for people in other

2766
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:24,239
places to participate effectively

2767
01:46:24,239 --> 01:46:28,719
and frequently um so dare i say if if

2768
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:30,639
one thing we might want to consider is

2769
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:32,480
should some of the time zone guidelines

2770
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:34,719
that on the paper that we started this

2771
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:37,199
meeting with apply to interims should

2772
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:38,239
they

2773
01:46:38,239 --> 01:46:41,280
be required to rotate time zones

2774
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,679
um should they be required to use better

2775
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:44,719
tooling

2776
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:48,480
um so that the remote experience of of

2777
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:51,520
interims is both consistent

2778
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,040
and and better

2779
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:56,000
um you know maybe that would be a good

2780
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,040
use of uh of some time and some

2781
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:02,320
expertise because i think at the moment

2782
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:04,159
my impression is they're pretty ad hoc

2783
01:47:04,159 --> 01:47:06,400
yeah in how they're arranged i mean i

2784
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:07,600
know there are some rules around you

2785
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:10,080
have give to two weeks notice et cetera

2786
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,719
but other than that they're left

2787
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:15,600
a lot to these devices of the individual

2788
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,440
working group so perhaps

2789
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:18,800
they'll be benefit from that being

2790
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:20,880
regularized but i'd go back to my

2791
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:22,400
original point nevertheless if there's

2792
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:24,719
to be an itf community as opposed to a

2793
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:27,679
working group community um then you know

2794
01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:30,880
there would be implications in in

2795
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:33,679
in putting a lot more emphasis on those

2796
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:37,119
rather than the itf sort of meetings as

2797
01:47:37,119 --> 01:47:41,040
they're currently structured thanks

2798
01:47:42,159 --> 01:47:45,679
thanks andrew uh martin

2799
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:48,239
thanks uh three three points that um are

2800
01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:50,800
in response to the things that have been

2801
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:52,320
moving through the discourse here uh i

2802
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:53,840
would like to unpack the second class

2803
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:56,000
experience experiment second class

2804
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,920
experience uh

2805
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:00,560
uh comment um so like

2806
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:02,480
personally it was only three or four

2807
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:03,600
years ago i was a regular remote

2808
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:04,639
attendee

2809
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:06,159
and having done

2810
01:48:06,159 --> 01:48:07,520
um

2811
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:09,760
uh having done uh

2812
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:12,480
a a having been a remote attendee under

2813
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:15,119
the old regime and a personal attendee

2814
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:16,719
and now this this new kind of remote

2815
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:18,480
attendee thing i would say like the real

2816
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:20,639
difference is that um

2817
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:22,080
in the in the first case i was not

2818
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:23,199
really participating in the side

2819
01:48:23,199 --> 01:48:24,880
conversations for reasons that are

2820
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:27,119
obvious um

2821
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:28,480
like

2822
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:29,440
the side

2823
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:30,560
most people would agree the side

2824
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:32,480
conversations are extremely valuable

2825
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:35,360
and i am not prepared to um kind of

2826
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:38,080
kneecap the productivity of itf by in an

2827
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:39,520
effort to ensure quality by just

2828
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:42,239
degrading the value by eliminating this

2829
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:44,239
really valuable process because some

2830
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:47,520
people can't attend it um

2831
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:50,080
secondly there's been a talk about like

2832
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:51,040
like

2833
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:54,400
more strict corporate travel rules um

2834
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,600
you know obviously if people don't want

2835
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,719
to come to meetings anymore we're going

2836
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:58,960
to stop having them but to the extent

2837
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:01,440
that the companies are limited limiting

2838
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:02,880
travel to

2839
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,480
within their continent that is actually

2840
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:06,320
a case to continue to be three times in

2841
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:07,679
person per year because then at least

2842
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:09,360
you could get the productivity of in

2843
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:11,360
person once per year that's what's why

2844
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:12,880
we rotate uh

2845
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:15,920
to a large extent uh and then finally

2846
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:17,679
about interims um

2847
01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:19,280
look you know i was a big participant in

2848
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:21,679
quick the interims were amazing uh but

2849
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:23,520
ietf 107

2850
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,400
was uh at least a it was an emergency

2851
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,719
situation but we went to a very interim

2852
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:31,440
heavy model and while you can poke at

2853
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:32,960
the exact details of implementation

2854
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:34,880
there

2855
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:36,800
we essentially had a month of meetings

2856
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:38,880
at about 1700 utc

2857
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:39,920
uh

2858
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:43,280
i did not find that to be a particularly

2859
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:45,599
good model um

2860
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:47,520
and and like you can you can tweak the

2861
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:49,199
details and maybe there's some like one

2862
01:49:49,199 --> 01:49:50,960
magic formula for for in terms that

2863
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:52,159
would

2864
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:53,920
work really well but that that seemed to

2865
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:56,000
be really onerous on people's schedules

2866
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,400
and also as andrew was suggesting not

2867
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:00,480
very um

2868
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:02,239
inclusive in terms of time zones like it

2869
01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:03,840
always falls into that link optimized

2870
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:06,960
time zone so uh

2871
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:09,760
like i said i midterms are good some

2872
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:11,679
working groups it really works but i'm

2873
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:14,080
really reluctant to just kind of

2874
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:17,440
drive a lot of working groups to to to

2875
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:20,960
be forced into that mode thanks

2876
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:23,280
thank you andrew did you have another

2877
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:25,440
comment or is i lingering around from

2878
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:29,960
the previous time you were just speaking

2879
01:50:38,159 --> 01:50:41,119
okay um so i i did have a comment to

2880
01:50:41,119 --> 01:50:42,320
make on this

2881
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:44,880
and so this is something i just observed

2882
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:47,119
um like interims work for some set of

2883
01:50:47,119 --> 01:50:48,719
people and some set of working groups

2884
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:50,480
but they don't work for others like i

2885
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:51,280
think

2886
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:52,719
when michael was talking about stuff

2887
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:54,560
working pretty well right like the iot

2888
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:56,239
cluster in the itf

2889
01:50:56,239 --> 01:50:58,239
it's almost like a mini idf so like

2890
01:50:58,239 --> 01:51:00,719
people kind of all hang out together

2891
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:03,040
and and they do attend like working

2892
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:04,719
groups across multiple areas so things

2893
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:05,599
become

2894
01:51:05,599 --> 01:51:07,679
easier like so for example like you know

2895
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:08,560
core

2896
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:09,760
in uh

2897
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:12,480
core and then like roll and lp van and

2898
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:14,960
all those things are kind of like

2899
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,000
pretty well integrated like

2900
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,760
technology-wise they all work together

2901
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,840
so it becomes a little bit easier to

2902
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,840
follow those things i do see like you

2903
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,239
know the like both sides of the argument

2904
01:51:24,239 --> 01:51:26,239
here but i think the

2905
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:28,000
real answer is it really depends like

2906
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,599
some some groups just get along well

2907
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:32,560
with interns and some don't and we just

2908
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:35,360
need to make sure that like uh different

2909
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:37,599
needs are accommodated by whatever we

2910
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:40,560
end up doing so thank you

2911
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:43,840
i think media are you up next

2912
01:51:46,239 --> 01:51:47,440
yeah i'm

2913
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:48,880
up again

2914
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:50,480
because this point about interim is

2915
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:51,760
actually something that we touched in

2916
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:54,000
the in the draft we discussed earlier

2917
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,360
and um

2918
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:56,960
so first of all i want to make a point

2919
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:57,679
that

2920
01:51:57,679 --> 01:51:59,119
rooms and the kind of meeting that you

2921
01:51:59,119 --> 01:52:00,960
have at this itf week are usually not

2922
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:02,800
have not the same dynamics they kind of

2923
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:04,400
work very differently and that's also

2924
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:06,080
why they might work definitely well for

2925
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:08,719
different uh groups um and they can

2926
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:11,280
achieve different goals um so i just

2927
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:13,199
encourage js to use like both of these

2928
01:52:13,199 --> 01:52:15,280
things in interim it's much better to

2929
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:17,280
have like a small group deep technical

2930
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:19,360
discussion which is very interactive

2931
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:21,679
while um in the meeting week you have

2932
01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:24,239
much more people who are not that

2933
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:26,000
frequently um reading the mailing list

2934
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,520
or coming to the meetings and can

2935
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:29,119
provide a different kind of feedback and

2936
01:52:29,119 --> 01:52:31,040
so you should also organize your meeting

2937
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:33,679
to accomplish these kind of things and

2938
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:36,000
so um what i would like to encourage

2939
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,679
shares is type to use both of these

2940
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:40,320
meeting forms appropriately and also

2941
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,080
consider if you always need to meet at

2942
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:44,000
the itf meeting or if you have if you

2943
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,199
are in a phase with your working group

2944
01:52:45,199 --> 01:52:47,760
where maybe interims are more um

2945
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:49,199
effective for you for example at the

2946
01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:50,560
beginning of a working group it does

2947
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:52,080
make sense to have these

2948
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:53,679
meetings in the meeting week because you

2949
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:55,040
want to have other people have a look

2950
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,400
but when you're like close to the end

2951
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:57,360
and you're just rushing through the

2952
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:58,639
issues maybe ingrams are more

2953
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:00,639
appropriate um so there is a little bit

2954
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:02,639
of discussion in the draft

2955
01:53:02,639 --> 01:53:04,480
um and the draft basically says it

2956
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:06,159
really depends on the chairs how they

2957
01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:07,840
want to organize it but if people want

2958
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,679
to add more text about that

2959
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:12,560
um i'm i'm happy to take tax proposals

2960
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:15,119
for the draft

2961
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:18,239
thank you maria thank you very much

2962
01:53:18,239 --> 01:53:20,400
uh i don't see

2963
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:22,320
anybody in the queue and we're almost

2964
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:24,480
out of time so i just give like a couple

2965
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:26,639
of seconds for people to

2966
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:28,239
like come up to the queue if they want

2967
01:53:28,239 --> 01:53:31,839
otherwise we'll just wrap

2968
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,400
going once

2969
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:39,599
twice

2970
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:40,960
and thrice

2971
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:42,800
so thank you very much folks this has

2972
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:45,360
been like a a fantastic meeting thank

2975
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:53,679
for at least the next week uh for the

2976
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:55,440
recharge proposal and then we ship it

2977
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:57,040
off to lars of course it's like still

2978
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,400
going to be open for comment after

2979
