1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,719
all right folks remember standards work

2
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,200
is a contributive process that we all do

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,359
together and we need volunteers to keep

4
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,359
things moving so

5
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,800
it's not a whole lot of work it's just

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,720
for one hour you kind of

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,320
keep track of the conversation and write

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,160
it down on a shared document and barbara

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,279
will help and

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,840

61
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,319
anyone who doesn't follow these uh you

62
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,599
know whether in the chat or on the

63
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,200
microphone or on the list will be asked

64
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,599
to leave so we have never had a problem

65
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,280
in this working group but just want to

66
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,840
always highlight this

67
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,120
um okay so as as we mentioned we are

68
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,040
looking for a volunteer from the

69
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,000
audience to take minutes and we can't

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,920
start the session without one

71
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,720
so we're just gonna sit here and stare

72
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,360
at the empty room until someone

73
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,000
volunteers

74
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,599
so if nobody else is willing to take

75
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,600
notes i can at least note what people

76
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,440
have told me since it's great for me

77
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,680
oh go ahead jonathan this is jonathan i

78
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,360

79
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,600
ah thank you so much that is extremely

80
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,919
appreciated and uh barbara will be there

81
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,120
to assist

82
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,440
uh i can take care of jabber scribing

83
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,040
because like with the meet echo chat

84
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
that is a very small responsibility

85
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,000
anymore and um

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,040
so uh but if you want to say something

87
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,080
and you

88
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,680
don't like want or don't have a

89
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,040
microphone you can say mick mic colon in

90
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,120
the chat and i will repeat what you said

91
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,240
for you

92
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,280
all right

93
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,120
here are some useful links if you're

94
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,040
looking at the pdf later that you can

95
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,980
click on

96
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,320
[Music]

97
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,600
as a reminder we have a working group

98
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,479
github organization in

99
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,080
other working groups the switch to

100
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,160
github has been incredibly useful for

101
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,320
tracking comments on documents i

102
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,639
personally really enjoy it because

103
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,039
it's very easy with email to like forget

104
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,720
one of the 12 comments that were sent to

105
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,560
one email whereas if they're issues it's

106
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,000
pretty clear when the issue is still

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,320
open that you need to address it

108
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,039
this we're not forcing anyone to use

109
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,960
github it is the responsibility of the

110
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,639
editors of a given document to choose if

111
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,240
they want to use it or not

112
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,039
uh if they do so wish please reach out

113
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,360
to us and we'll help you set up and

114
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,800
give you admin rights and everything

115
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,759

134
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,880
awesome

135
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,120
uh in terms of

136
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,280
working group adopted document status we

137
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,520
currently have three documents

138
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,800
so the one that we've had for the

139
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,759
longest time is srp

140
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,520
it's we started working group last call

141
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,400
in july so this one's almost done um

142
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
we

143
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,479
had a recent round and recent revision

144
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,919
which addressed those comments a few

145
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,360
weeks ago

146
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,639
and some more comments since then um

147
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,440
so

148
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,960
that one seems to be pretty close we're

149
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,560
mainly waiting on you know authors

150
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,000
addressing comments to make progress on

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,280
them here

152
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,680
we did however notice a bit late in the

153
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,240
game that that draft had a normative

154
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,440
reference on an individual draft

155
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,160
which would block publication so we

156
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,400
adopted that individual draft which is

157
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,720
the second item here the update lease

158
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,840
in september and uh there were so we're

159
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,520
right now we're waiting on the on the

160
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,120
editors to take into account some

161
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,160
comments that were made during the

162
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,919
adoption call

163
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,520
and then the third one is the

164
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,360
advertising proxy document which we

165
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,919
adopted uh we need the editors to

166
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,479
reupload that with the draft.etfd and

167
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,240
ssd to make it clear that it's working

168
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,960
now a working document and similarly to

169
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,800
start addressing the issues that were

170
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,039
brought up during adoption

171
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,039
in terms of individual drafts uh we have

172
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,400
three uh with uh ted and co-authors from

173
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,280
apple

174
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,919
uh the first two at the top on

175
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,039
uh replication and discovery of zones

176
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,800
were first published like at the last

177
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
meeting in a little bit discussed there

178
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,440
and then we have a new one that uh ted

179
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,759
just published a few weeks ago

180
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,039
uh

181
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,039
and our agenda really flows from this

182
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,560
list of documents we're going to start

183
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,560
off with the

184
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,479
three that are that are adopted by the

185
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,599
working group

186
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,680
and then with the time remaining the

187
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,440
three that are individual drafts

188
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,120
would anyone like to bash this agenda

189
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,160
going once

190
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,400
going twice

191
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,120
done all right i'm

192
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,679
gonna stop presenting and ted you're up

193
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,718
please stand in the pink box

194
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,839
uh actually don't do the share the

195
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,399
screen option go to the just to the

196
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,399
right of the join queue you should be

197
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,519
asked to share slides

198
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,519
so on the top left of your screen

199
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,800
you should have a join cue button and

200
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,080
like

201
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,959
there you go grant pre-loaded slides

202
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,720
and then you can pick like starting off

203
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,440
with the srp one

204
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,279
perfect yeah that uses a lot less

205
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,200
bandwidth and gives like a really nice

206
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,920
uh

207
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,680
i'm in control

208
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,959
exactly

209
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,680
that's right all right so

210
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,880
yeah so

211
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,760
uh

212
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,680
basically i think i think dave has

213
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,800
already pretty much summed up the

214
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,720
current status uh so

215
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
we can move right on to the sleep proxy

216
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,680
question

217
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,560
uh the issue with the sleep proxy is

218
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,279
um this is something that's um

219
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,560
it's a it's an mdns feature that that uh

220
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,880
i think at least exists in in apple's

221
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,800
mdns implementation

222
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,959
uh possibly and others

223
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,839
um and

224
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,680
currently uh relies on mdns

225
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,920
updates and so it seemed like it would

226
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,519
make sense to

227
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,720
uh use srp since srp is a dns update and

228
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,440
all that the problem is

229
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,200
that uh

230
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,720
as opposed to all of the other work

231
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,399
that's been going on in srp we really

232
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,800
haven't spent much time on the

233
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,720
uh the sleep proxy section of the

234
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,399
document and so it's not in very good

235
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,240
shape

236
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,440
and

237
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,680
that put us in the position where you

238
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,040
know i got some comments on the sleep

239
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,480
proxy part of the document and i

240
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,760
basically just couldn't really address

241
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,880
them easily

242
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,760
um

243
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,079
and my conclusion was let's take this

244
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,360
out of the document and do it in a

245
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,200
different document so that we don't

246
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,920
hold up the srp work based on the sleep

247
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,519
proxy work

248
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,200
conveniently there is already another

249
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,240
document

250
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
so um

251
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,920
so just a few things about this uh so

252
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,839
reasons for removing it uh it's not

253
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,040
ready to go

254
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,440
uh it's not really the same thing as srp

255
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,800
although it's related

256
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,000
um

257
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,560
we have

258
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,320
sorry we have um

259
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,600
we have another document we could do it

260
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,360
in really easily the eds zero owner

261
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,440
option is basically

262
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,200
the thing that was originally done to

263
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,279
document the mdns sleep proxy so we

264
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,240
could just

265
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
shovel the you know section

266
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,880
whatever it is into that document and

267
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,160
advance that separately which i think

268
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,839
would make sense

269
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,200
um

270
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,760
and then uh

271
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,839
let's see uh

272
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,920
yeah so and smaller chunks of work is

273
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,200
good and

274
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,880
um

275
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,959
yeah uh

276
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,240
eds zero

277
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,200
owner

278
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,040
like we might actually want to to be

279
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,760
able to put that into into regular dns

280
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,760
not just for advertising proxies so

281
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,680
when i hang up that means i'm not ready

282
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,079
to answer the phone not that i'm bitter

283
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,200
um

284
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,560
so uh sorry uh

285
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,000
and then you know the the argument

286
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,120
against it is that there really isn't a

287
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,560
whole lot going on on the owner option

288
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,240
right now and i don't know if anybody's

289
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,399
gonna do this work so if we don't do it

290
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,160
in the srp document it may just not

291
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,680
happen

292
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,800
i don't think that's a good argument

293
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,639
against but i'm open to the working

294
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,839
group commenting on that so basically

295
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,040
what does the working group think about

296
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,560
this should we should we keep this

297
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,880
around in srp and

298
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,880
delay srp or move it into eds zero

299
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,440
owner option

300
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,920
or something else

301
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,480
a clarifying question ted

302
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,320
in the options of what to do you

303
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,480
mentioned moving it to another document

304
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,920
and you said luckily we have another

305
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,040
document which document were you

306
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,079
referring to well when i say we i mean a

307
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,079
document has been has been worked on and

308
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,600
uploaded to the tracker it's not a

309
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,120
working group document

310
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,920
um that document is uh draft cheshire

311
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,320
edness zero owner option

312
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,440
um

313
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
and oh i see it and it's uh yeah it's

314
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,639
expired but it could be revived right

315
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,480
right exactly and it's i think it's in

316
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
it's you know we would need to revive it

317
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,320
anyway if we were going to advance this

318
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,560
in srp so it's not like

319
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,959
you know we we might as well we might as

320
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,880
well uh i think we might as well shovel

321
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,560
the work in there as well and and finish

322
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,320
that as a separate as a separate item

323
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,560
because then it just decouples these two

324
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,639
pieces of work

325
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,480
i think the right thing to do is to move

326
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,399
this to another document

327
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,760
um

328
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,680
we might want to keep owner options

329
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,200
separate as a small self-contained

330
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,279
thing in its own right

331
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,920
originally ted and i thought that

332
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,639
srp and sleep proxy

333
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,279
had sufficient overlap that

334
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,959
it made sense to discuss them in one

335
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,399
document

336
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,240
because they're both using dns updates

337
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,639
with a lifetime to put data into some

338
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,880
server then does something with it

339
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,600
but

340
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,160
um i agree with what ted is proposing

341
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,920
now which is

342
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,880
um

343
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,760
the sleep proxy work is kind of moribund

344
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,680
and it's still potentially useful in the

345
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,720
future

346
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,839
but uh tying it to the srp document no

347
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,279
longer makes sense

348
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,199
so if we want to pick that up later we

349
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,880
can make a new document for that it

350
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,519
shouldn't hold up srp

351
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,560
so it sounds like uh

352
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,639
what uh everyone's

353
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,040
or the proposal is

354
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,360
like leave it out of this and then bring

355
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,199
it in another document either you know

356
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,440
revive that expired one or or a separate

357
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,240
one

358
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,720
uh at some later date um

359
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,720
if if someone wants to

360
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,000
uh is there any uh objection to this in

361
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,800
the working group or any other stops by

362
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,359
the way huh

363
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
all right ted i think you have your

364
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,600
answer

365
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,839
okay

366
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,079
and now the question is

367
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,839
ah here we go so our next

368
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,160
topic is the edns zero owner option and

369
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,760
i'm getting a big

370
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,519
oh here here we go okay

371
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,079
uh sorry the eds zero update lease

372
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,000
option um

373
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,800
so this is this is yeah that there's uh

374
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,120
our adrik in the queue

375
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,959
just wanted to jump in the queue it's

376
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,800
kind of impolite but i just want to be

377
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,120
sure the previous document has been

378
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,240
looking good last called right

379
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,600
uh that is correct

380
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,240
and is only such a change

381
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,800
deserve another working group last call

382
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,560
oh sorry so we are actually we already

383
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,360
did that so um that uh

384
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,120
sorry the sleep proxy section was

385
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,480
removed in version 11 or 12

386
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
during working hoop last call and when

387
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,639
that version was submitted we extended

388
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,880
the working group last call by two weeks

389
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,560
and we are in the middle of those two

390
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,480
weeks right now so

391
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,639
i should have trusted my chairs and my

392
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,279
authors thank you so much david

393
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,199
no it's no no it's worth double checking

394
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,680
this and and just and to clarify i

395
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,120
haven't seen any objections to the

396
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,079
removal on the list

397
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
kind of the whole point of of bringing

398
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,320
this up here is just to make sure that

399
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,240
we don't you know somebody doesn't miss

400
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,000
the fact that we're talking about

401
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,480
removing this and then later say well

402
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,320
so anyway um so the eds zero uh update

403
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,000
lease option this is basically just like

404
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,839
a piece of of plumbing that we need in

405
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,600
order to get srp to work

406
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,360
um

407
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,240
uh

408
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,079
the problem is that and it's sort of a

409
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,120
general problem it's not just srp

410
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,440
when you do a dns update this adds an

411
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,839
owner name and a bunch of ours you know

412
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,880
one or more rr's to um

413
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,920
to a dns zone and uh then those just

414
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,440
kind of stay there unless somebody does

415
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,120
something either you know the client

416
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
removes it the administrator removes it

417
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,680
or it just sits there

418
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,920
and additionally you know as we all know

419
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,399
srp requires a lease because we actually

420
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,759
wanted to solve that problem at least

421
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,440
for srp

422
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,519
but it's also the case that other dns

423
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,279
updates could benefit from the same

424
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,399
functionality

425
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,720
srp is a specific

426
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,440
refinement of dns updates specifically

427
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,839
for doing sort of permissionless

428
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,639
advertising using dns updates and so

429
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,959
it's not the only dns update

430
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,799
type that exists and and we might want

431
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,319
this for others as well

432
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,079
um

433
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,160
so we have this this new option it's got

434
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,720
a lease time in it um it's actually got

435
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,240
two lease times got one is the lease

436
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,839
time for the resource record that you're

437
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,240
adding and the other is at least time

438
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,839
for a key record which you might also

439
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,599
provide and this is

440
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,839
generally specific to srp because srp

441
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,919
uses the key record plus 60 to

442
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,760
authenticate the update

443
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,160
and the idea there is just that

444
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,400
the key record is going to allow us to

445
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,799
keep ownership of the name even if the

446
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,799
service being advertised is not hasn't

447
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,480
been renewed and therefore is assumed

448
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,720
not to be present so it's just a way to

449
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,559
avoid um

450
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,320
uh

451
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,520
names being sort of snarfed just as the

452
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,840
service that was advertising the name is

453
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,919
you know away from the network briefly

454
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,640
so um

455
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,080
so that's that's the basic idea um

456
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,400
and then uh the document is in pretty

457
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
good shape i think david mentioned there

458
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,120
were some comments i haven't actually

459
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,280
had a chance to to look at the comments

460
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,640
but i don't get the sense that there's

461
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,520
anything

462
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,840
uh that's likely to be a show stopper

463
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,960
um

464
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,760
so

465
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,240
uh

466
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,799
the question really is um you know right

467
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,400
now we've got some text that talks about

468
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,160
dns updates

469
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,600
uh

470
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,520
and and so we've got it's there's some

471
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,440
protocol along with the

472
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,799
um

473
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,480
along with the uh

474
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,880
the sort of nuts and bolts of like what

475
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,080
the option looks like and what the

476
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,520
pieces of it do

477
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,120
and uh

478
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,160
that has been somewhat moribund uh it's

479
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,480
kind of it's kind of in stewart's

480
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,600
ballpark

481
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,919
and stewart's um

482
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,919
uh stewart's up it's it's up to stewart

483
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,440
to update that in a sense but stuart

484
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,480
doesn't have a lot of time for doing

485
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,000
updates and so it hasn't been updated so

486
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,360
the question is can we do that um and

487
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,559
then finish the document

488
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,559
so

489
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,120
i think the document's ready to read uh

490
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,960
my personal feeling is i'd like to make

491
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,640
the document as lightweight as possible

492
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,240
but i'm curious to know what the working

493
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,799
group thinks about that

494
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,280
and whether we can make progress on this

495
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,840
quickly if the working group wants to

496
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,039
you know depending on what the working

497
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,280
group decides

498
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
so that's kind of

499
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,120
that's kind of where it's at

500
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,480
i i guess i didn't actually put this in

501
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,840
the slides because it didn't occur to me

502
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,679
but what does that i do the question of

503
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,440
the working group is kind of do we

504
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,840
do we want to just like cut out all the

505
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,160
fat and progress this quickly or should

506
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,880
we

507
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,840
really

508
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,039
get the uh you know dns update part of

509
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,400
this

510
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,320
solid so that we can publish that i

511
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,640
don't think it's a big problem to do the

512
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,799
the second so i'm not i'm not really

513
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,480
advocating against that i'm just saying

514
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,000
you know there is

515
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,840
some additional work if we go that route

516
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,840
um thanks ted uh so if anyone has

517
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,679
opinions on any of these questions

518
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,919
please come to the microphone otherwise

519
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,120
i'm thinking of doing a poll to see

520
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,799
like where we are in terms of having

521
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,280
read it uh peter go ahead

522
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,080
hello um on this option do i understand

523
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,840
correctly that it would also apply

524
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,960
outside of dns sd situations like

525
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,520
dhcp leases in a normal

526
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,679
bind server or whatever

527
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,919
yeah the idea is that if you provide a

528
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,760
lease you're you're telling the server

529
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,600
you know if i want this to stay around

530
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,880
i'm going to renew it so you don't have

531
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,039
to take care of that

532
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,039
so it's not required like it's not we're

533
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,039
not saying all dns updates must have

534
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,280
this option we're just saying if this

535
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,600
option is present here's what you do

536
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,799
right and vendors of servers doing 2136

537
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,960
might expect this feature request at

538
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,840
some point then yes definitely okay

539
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,200
please let dns hope no at the right time

540
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,880
yeah with lost course something

541
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,679
absolutely um our

542
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,480
our goal as uh chairs is to um

543
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,200
sorry our goal is chairs is to uh and we

544
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,039
we had a discussion when we first

545
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,520
adopted this document between uh all the

546
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,200
chairs of the various dns working groups

547
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,120
and your corresponding ads

548
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,200
and the conclusion was that we would

549
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,039
adopt and progress this document indian

550
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,240
ssd but that the working group last call

551
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,000
would be sent to the nsop absolutely so

552
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,840
that's that's definitely going to happen

553
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,000
perfect thank you

554
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,919
i can just add a bit more background on

555
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:30,960
this

556
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,240
um

557
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,280
the

558
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,000
the lease time for dns updates

559
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,120
is

560
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,039
uh something that is

561
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,480
i believe generally useful

562
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,760
when dns update was originally defined

563
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,799
uh

564
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,919
it was

565
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,360
um

566
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,960
it was sort of an alternative to making

567
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,039
the edits to a zone file

568
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,200
uh so instead of editing his own file

569
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,320
with

570
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,120
uh vi and reloading the name server you

571
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,039
could use the ns update command but all

572
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,520
the edits were permanent there was sort

573
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,120
of an unstated assumption it was being

574
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,960
done by a human

575
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,360
and what the update lease does

576
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,440
is it makes it more suitable for

577
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,360
machine-to-machine style communication

578
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,840
just like a dxep lease has to be renewed

579
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,080
or it goes away automatically

580
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,640
this is it's intentionally modeled like

581
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,520
a dhcp lease that the client requests a

582
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,640
lifetime

583
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,280
the server can grant that

584
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,880
or more or less

585
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,200
and if the client gets unceremoniously

586
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,640
disconnected from the network it

587
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,720
prevents stale data from persisting

588
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,720
indefinitely

589
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,280
quick background uh stuart uh that's

590
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,240
helpful

591
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,880
um so it sounds let's see so i have a

592
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,320
poll open um if you like either it

593
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,600
popped up somewhere on your screen

594
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,960
otherwise if you click on the show of

595
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,120
hands tool on the top right

596
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,360
on whether or not you've people have

597
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,520
read this draft and i'm going to end it

598
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,799
it looks like we have nine people who

599
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,039
have read the deaf which is good

600
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:05,919
um

601
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,000
so i would say in terms of next steps uh

602
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,520
i think the responsibility right now is

603
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,280
on the authors to address the comments

604
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,600
that were raised during adoption

605
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,200
published a new revision mention it to

606
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,039
the working group and then see we can

607
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:19,840
have a

608
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,400
discussion on there to see if folks like

609
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,080
it if there's not

610
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,039
um too much contention we can then

611
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,799
progress the document pretty quickly

612
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,480
move on to work group last call which

613
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,640
will then trigger review from various

614
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,000
other working groups

615
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,640
uh so at that point i ideally perhaps we

616
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,080
have that um

617
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,200
timed

618
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
uh so we can do a few rounds of edits

619
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,640
and then have working with last call

620
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,120
like during the next atf so that way

621
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,039
maybe it can be discussed at the end of

622
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,880
the dns op meeting there if uh if the

623
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,960
chairs over there are interested

624
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,240
um

625
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,880
all right any other thoughts from folks

626
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,159
on the update lease document

627
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,880
okay i think ted you can switch gears to

628
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,960
advertising proxy

629
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,039
yeah so um

630
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,559
this document hasn't actually gotten a

631
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,720
lot of love in the last uh

632
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,640
you know since the last ietf

633
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,600
um

634
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,120
there's been a lot of implementation

635
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,360
work on it but uh but we haven't had a

636
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,080
chance to do much to update the document

637
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,279
um

638
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,000
so uh the idea is uh for those who

639
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,520
aren't aware the advertising proxy is a

640
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,679
way that we can do srp updates

641
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,520
uh and then advertise the result of

642
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,600
those srp updates using mdns rather than

643
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,080
using dns

644
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,799
and the reason for doing that was uh

645
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,799
primarily to enable stub networks to

646
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,720
advertise services on infrastructure

647
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,559
networks so this stub network being like

648
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,400
an iot network that's just one hop away

649
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,480
and doesn't have any transit but just

650
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,559
provides reachability to clients that

651
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,279
have different uh you know 802.15.4

652
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,039
radios or something like that

653
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,960
um

654
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,840
and then

655
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,960
another uh nice feature of this

656
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,240
uh that um

657
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,080
uh

658
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,080
that comes up is that uh it makes it

659
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,240
possible to to sort of eliminate using

660
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,880
mdns but still allow that is to say

661
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,640
eliminate allow a client to stop using

662
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,400
mdns to advertise stuff

663
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,799
but allow clients that do use mdns to

664
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,480
still discover the stuff

665
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,440
um

666
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,279
so those are kind of the two things the

667
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,840
document does um it's been adopted i

668
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,760
haven't uploaded it yet

669
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,080
as i said it's in pretty good shape but

670
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,039
um

671
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,240
there are some issues with name

672
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,760
conflicts that we haven't really

673
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,520
addressed um

674
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,320
and uh so in fact you'll notice there's

675
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,240
a new document that i'm proposing the

676
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,559
tsr document which addresses some of the

677
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,799
name name conflict issues the problem is

678
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,679
that our model for uh for dealing with

679
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,000
name conflicts in mdns is not really

680
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,760
oriented towards proxies and i'll talk

681
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,640
more about that in the tsr document

682
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,520
but but basically we need to update this

683
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,320
document to describe that stuff as well

684
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,400
so that so that it you know first of all

685
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,679
it needs to have a normative reference

686
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,080
to the tsr document and secondly i think

687
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,520
it needs some additional text to talk

688
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,879
about how to deal with um

689
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,760
with conflicts generally

690
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,200
so um

691
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,400
so i think it needs some more work um

692
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,919
and uh

693
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,760
you know i i would not encourage people

694
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,360
to read the document yet because i think

695
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,000
that we need to to do an update and then

696
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,600
once that update is done i really

697
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,959
appreciate some reads and reviews

698
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,200
thank you ted i'm gonna similarly do a

699
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,960
poll just to get a feel for um

700
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,159
who's read it um oh

701
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,240
well i guess i forgot to put a title

702
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,720
sorry so this one is have you read uh

703
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,039
this document uh i don't know where that

704
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,960
window went but you can raise hand to

705
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,760
say you've read this one or or not raise

706
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,720
um

707
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,039
well while we're doing that uh if anyone

708
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,880
has any uh

709
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,840
questions comments on this document uh

710
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,880
please

711
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,440
join the mic line

712
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,440
all right cool so we have seven folks

713
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,960
who've read it uh nice um esco go ahead

714
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,039
yeah i did send my comments by email so

715
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,480
i'm not sure if i'm supposed to

716
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,279
reiterate them here

717
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,200
i'm not sure if that has had the time

718
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,480
even to

719
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,720
to check out these

720
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,960
most recent comments

721
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,760
i don't think i did um

722
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,360
i'll double check

723
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,760
but uh yeah i don't think we really need

724
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,120
to work on it here we don't have a we

725
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,320
don't have a lot of time so it's

726
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,600
probably not worth going into it in

727
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,039
detail here but

728
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,720
i'll take a look at your comments and as

729
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,760
i said i'm going to update a new

730
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,200
document so

731
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,120
so that would be the time to to review

732
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,799
and see if i missed something or dealt

733
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,120
with with the issues you raised

734
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,120
yeah i think the main point was uh that

735
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,120
i think one section really needs to be

736
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,840
simplified in some way and

737
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,640
maybe some other people can also have a

738
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,880
look at it see you yeah see if that can

739
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,799
be done

740
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,200
because it just looks to me uh like like

741
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,520
it's almost too complex to

742
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,720
just parse when you casually read it

743
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,320
maybe the implementers don't have a

744
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,399
problem with it but

745
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,600
yeah for our audience it should also be

746
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,000
clear enough simple enough i think

747
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,679
but that's the main comment i had for

748
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,799
the rest looks good

749
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,360
thank you for that esko um so i think in

750
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,399
terms of next steps here um ted you have

751
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,480
some edits that you want to make to the

752
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
doc and then we have some comments from

753
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,399
esco that need to be addressed

754
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,279
so

755
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,440
one actually item is on you to have

756
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,520
those uh submit a revision of the draft

757
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,320
and then

758
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,919
let the mailing list know so we can have

759
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,760
people review that uh that revised

760
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,880
version

761
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,399
yep um

762
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,440
okay if unless we have some something

763
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,679
else on this document i think we can

764
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,480
move on to the next one

765
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,600
so

766
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,840
these uh yeah we're transitioning from

767
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,600
the working group documents you know

768
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,320
current work to individual drafts future

769
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,200
work

770
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
um the

771
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,760
uh what what i'm noticing here though is

772
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,760
that a lot like all the action items

773
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,559
appear to be on uted so maybe from a

774
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,240
chair's perspective

775
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,320
um i mean let's discuss this new work

776
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,679
that's good but i think we should

777
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,440
probably focus on the existing work and

778
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,360
getting that out the door before we add

779
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,080
more things to our plate

780
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,559
fair enough yeah um i will say that that

781
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,279
i have gotten some offers uh so uh

782
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,960
they're uh

783
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,399
one of the uh other implementers of this

784
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,640
protocol uh who is here in the room

785
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,240
today i'm not gonna mention his name but

786
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,080
he can he can mention his name if he

787
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,360
wants um has authored to has offered to

788
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,600
to help out and you know with the

789
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,760
replication protocol document

790
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,840
and uh so i'm thinking that it would be

791
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,360
nice to add him as a co-author and that

792
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,320
would

793
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,480
potentially reduce the workload on me

794
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,120
and

795
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,039
that would be good whether we

796
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,640
whether we adopted immediately or not

797
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,240
but but basically i just want people to

798
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,039
be aware of this and and um

799
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,120
and thinking about it and and

800
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,640
you know maybe even trying an

801
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,559
implementation or or

802
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,320
criticizing it because

803
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,760
uh you know

804
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,840
it well

805
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,120
i'll i'll get to the end of the document

806
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,760
and then talk about this um so i wanted

807
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,840
to just sounds good just uh just to

808
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,480
answer to that quickly um i think that's

809
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,880
a great idea uh because i think you're

810
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,559
pretty and both steward and you are

811
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,919
bandwidth limited these days which i

812
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,159
totally understand we all have day jobs

813
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,520
and so

814
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,120
adding a co-author before asking for

815
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,120
adoption sounds like a great idea it'll

816
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,360
definitely give us more confidence that

817
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,279
the document will be worked on

818
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,279
um so that sounds absolutely great

819
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,880
thanks all right go ahead

820
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,640
sure so i just wanted to give a quick

821
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,039
overview of what what's going on here

822
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,960
because you know there there's a lot of

823
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,480
stuff in fly uh you know obviously dnssd

824
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,440
has been working on dnssd generally for

825
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,399
quite a while

826
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,240
we have mdns we've had that since before

827
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,840
the working group started

828
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,240
dnssd on dns we had these are all in the

829
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,640
base document 6762 and 6763.

830
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,559
the working group produced the discovery

831
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,519
proxy document which allows us to do

832
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,720
to use dns to do mdns discovery on a on

833
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
a link

834
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,120
and then srp which we're almost done

835
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,440
with lets us register servers with

836
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,200
register services with an authoritative

837
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,559
server

838
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,159
and the advertising proxy lets us

839
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,559
advertise services in from that

840
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,720
authoritative server using mdns

841
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,919
so that's kind of the stuff that's that

842
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,320
that we're already working on

843
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,480
and most of that stuff is fairly mature

844
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,760
and we should be able to shove it out

845
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,519
the door pretty quickly

846
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,399
um

847
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,159
so uh then there's srp replication srp

848
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,240
replication addresses the problem that

849
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,600
when i started doing the um

850
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,039
the uh

851
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,960
srp work i was just assuming that we

852
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,720
were updating like by nine or something

853
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,080
like that i wasn't really thinking about

854
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,240
it in terms of of uh

855
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,399
you know home networks um

856
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,640
and uh so srp assumes an authoritative

857
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,440
server but um that turns out not to be a

858
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,880
very realistic assumption on a home

859
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,720
network on a home network the home

860
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,559
router is usually some little like you

861
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,240
know box that like they were trying to

862
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,000
they were trying to reduce the

863
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,880
the the materials cost to the lowest

864
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,960
possible amount so they put in less

865
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,200
memory less flash everything so having

866
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,880
that act as a as a resource for doing uh

867
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,440
service registration turns out not to be

868
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,200
uh

869
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,720
it just doesn't work

870
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,640
right now that could change we'd like

871
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,080
that to change but that's the way it is

872
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,840
right now um

873
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,640
and so uh the existing

874
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,120
uh implementations of srp that that are

875
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,559
out there in the world

876
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,519
are

877
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,919
actually devices that are that are srp

878
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,840
plus advertising proxy

879
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,000
and wouldn't it be nice to be able to

880
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,960
have

881
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,440
sort of the the reliability of a managed

882
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,960
dns server without

883
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,679
without a manager and so srp replication

884
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,600
allows us allows a bunch of devices a

885
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,519
bunch of srp slash

886
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,919
advertising proxy servers to

887
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,279
um

888
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,080
to collaborate in producing that

889
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,880
reasonably stable namespace

890
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,559
without

891
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,559
there being an operator so like you

892
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,720
could have for example like a couple

893
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,880
homepod minis each one of those has an

894
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,640
srp server each one of them is doing srp

895
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,559
replication if any one of them gets an

896
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,240
update all of the other ones get that

897
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,559
update it's really nice so

898
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,000
that's kind of the goal of srp

899
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
replication is just to like fill that

900
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,600
that

901
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,760
that box in the block diagram with

902
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,960
something that doesn't have to be

903
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,559
managed by a network administrator

904
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,240
and then

905
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,360
the other work that i'm going to be

906
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,200
talking about uh permissionless

907
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,120
advertising of dns zones

908
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,080
is

909
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,200
basically

910
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,039
once you have that stable dns server

911
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,879
or reasonably stable dns server wouldn't

912
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,399
it be nice to be able to just query it

913
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,119
using dns or dns push rather than

914
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,960
multicast dns you can eliminate some of

915
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,119
the dns

916
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,399
so

917
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,639
so basically what this allows us to do

918
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,918
is um

919
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,159
what the the permissionless advertising

920
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,159
work is going to allow us to do is

921
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,599
to allow dnssd clients to query srp

922
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,520
uh they can basically discover the srp

923
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,918
server and then start using it as an srp

924
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,199
server as a dns server rather than

925
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,480
using the advertising proxy

926
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,760
way of talking to it and similarly uh if

927
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,839
if your infrastructure supports

928
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:46,800
um

929
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,918
you know delegating dns zones uh then we

930
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,079
have a way to uh to advertise a

931
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,320
discovery proxy or to advertise

932
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,239
an srp server

933
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,920
into the infrastructure um

934
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,520
in a way that that

935
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,079
just cleanly you know works

936
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,760
and then we can actually eliminate mdns

937
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,160
entirely um and still get all of the

938
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,599
functionality that we currently get with

939
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,160
mdns we get the you know the support for

940
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,520
um

941
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,079
uh you know service discovery we get

942
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,119
immediate

943
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,640
like we can have an ongoing query and

944
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,920
get immediate results because we have

945
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,320
dns push so it basically gives us all of

946
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,760
the stuff we're used to with mdns

947
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,520
without any multicast

948
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,560
um

949
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,440
so

950
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,800
uh

951
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,880
back to srp replication

952
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,640
um the first question is why do we need

953
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,280
a new protocol and um

954
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,520
the problem is like my initial thought

955
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,119
was to use dns and ixfr but uh

956
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,800
i couldn't actually come up with a way

957
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,720
to do it that i could figure out how to

958
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,720
implement and that i thought was going

959
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,119
to work well

960
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,440
you know we have this problem that that

961
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,560
dns

962
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,880
expects there to be a primary and the

963
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,240
primary replicates everything to the

964
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,400
secondaries but we can't assume that any

965
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,280
one of the servers in an srp cloud is

966
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,520
stable so it might go away at any time

967
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,440
so that means that when it goes away we

968
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,880
have to

969
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,560
we have to pick a different primary and

970
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,880
we have to figure out if the data that

971
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,640
that server has is correct and it just

972
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,560
becomes like this big

973
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,240
challenging problem

974
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,599
um and

975
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,839
the biggest problem is we don't actually

976
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,920
have a way to establish trust

977
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,400
so the only real trust that we have is

978
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,680
that when we get um

979
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,000
an srp update that update was signed by

980
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,160
the client and so we know if we get

981
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,320
another update for the same name

982
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,920
we can tell if it came from the same

983
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,880
client

984
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,359
and so i kind of wanted to leverage that

985
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,000
source of truth for srp replication and

986
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,800
that meant that i couldn't just um

987
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,320
we couldn't just have a zone because the

988
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,760
zone doesn't have the information that

989
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,720
we need to to actually validate

990
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,520
that

991
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,920
that a new change to the to the database

992
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,520
actually came from an srp client it

993
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,880
didn't just come from a rogue srp

994
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,480
replication server

995
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,280
so

996
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,440
that's kind of why

997
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,960
i invented a new protocol sorry

998
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,119
so the new protocol

999
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,800
the idea is that there's an arbitrary

1000
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,560
number of srp replication peers which

1001
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,920
can come and go we could limit the

1002
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,520
number if we wanted to and i think that

1003
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,800
might make sense but i don't know what

1004
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,160
the limit would be

1005
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,520
there is no

1006
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,640
authority

1007
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,800
uh we're trying to maintain a common

1008
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,200
data set um all the servers are

1009
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,880
communicating

1010
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,320
they're all peers

1011
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,079
but we do have a precedence because

1012
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,440
we've got to we've got to figure out

1013
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,599
some way to decide who talks to who

1014
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,599
whom um

1015
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,000
and uh

1016
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,400
you know we have a database sync and

1017
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,640
reconciliation process and then whenever

1018
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,640
you know we just whenever something

1019
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,200
changes we we replicate those updates to

1020
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,520
all of the other servers

1021
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,119
um

1022
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,599
so uh so

1023
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,280
the way this works is that so we're

1024
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,800
assuming that the srp client is only

1025
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,119
going to update one server so there's

1026
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,400
going to be some advertisements for

1027
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,240
servers clients going to pick a server

1028
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,359
it's going to advertise to that server

1029
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,680
we can identify the client using crypto

1030
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,280
because it has a public key

1031
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,079
uh so we know if we get an update we

1032
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,440
know that it's from the same client or

1033
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,280
that it's not from the same client

1034
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,119
uh for any given host record um

1035
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,000
and we know when we got the update so so

1036
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,280
if a client sends an update uh

1037
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,119
it's either newer than what we have or

1038
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,119
it's older than we but if we received an

1039
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,560
srp update it's always going to be newer

1040
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,760
than what we have

1041
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,640
so

1042
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,400
um so essentially

1043
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,760
the the client winds up being the

1044
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,800
authoritative server for its data and uh

1045
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,680
we just maintain this data set

1046
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,440
we try to keep the data set in sync it's

1047
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,040
not a catastrophe if it's not in sync

1048
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,040
the worst case scenario if we if we

1049
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,640
totally lose a client update is that

1050
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,000
we'll get that information the next time

1051
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,520
the client renews

1052
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,480
so

1053
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,560
it's it's it's as stable as it needs to

1054
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,000
be for what we're trying to do it's not

1055
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,280
perfect but it doesn't have to be

1056
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,720
perfect

1057
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,560
um

1058
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,480
so what we're replicating is um

1059
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,520
you know the the the data uh but but we

1060
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,920
actually replicate the the srp updates

1061
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,760
not the data the srp updates are then

1062
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,359
applied to our local version of the

1063
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,920
database and that winds up replicating

1064
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,920
the data but because we're replicating

1065
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,480
the updates we can validate them

1066
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,000
um

1067
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,240
so uh

1068
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,440
so

1069
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,680
you guys can read the slide again later

1070
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,040
if you if you want to get more details

1071
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,000
but that's the basic idea so um

1072
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,520
so the flow of the protocol is that

1073
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,280
first when an srp server comes online it

1074
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,640
needs to figure out what data set it's

1075
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,720
replicating um

1076
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,000
and that's somewhat situationally

1077
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,119
dependent and there's some language in

1078
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,640
the document that talks about how to do

1079
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,960
that but but it may be implementation

1080
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,640
dependent we can't necessarily specify

1081
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,040
it in full detail

1082
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,359
or there may be sort of uh documents

1083
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,040
that specify like if you're trying to do

1084
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,040
srp replication in this situation this

1085
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,839
is what it looks like

1086
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,280
um so in other words for example the

1087
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,560
stub networks document's probably going

1088
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,560
to have some text about that

1089
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,560
so we choose a data set we try to find

1090
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,400
srp replication peers that are

1091
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,560
replicating that data set and if we find

1092
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,560
them then we start we just join in

1093
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,640
if we don't then we become the first and

1094
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,520
we start advertising um

1095
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,440
and uh

1096
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,480
and that's pretty much it um

1097
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,960
so then the next step in the protocol is

1098
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,839
connecting

1099
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,359
um and reconciliation so we connect to a

1100
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:26,240
peer

1101
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,040
um

1102
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,200
and then we compare our databases

1103
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,160
uh and uh

1104
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,000
what we're looking for is um

1105
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
if the if the peer has newer data than

1106
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,160
we have then we want the newer data and

1107
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,839
if we have newer data than the peer has

1108
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,160
then then we want to give that newer

1109
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,760
data to the peer

1110
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,040
and so that means even if we got some

1111
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,400
updates before

1112
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,560
reconciliation occurred we can still

1113
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,680
reconcile them and we we can feel secure

1114
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,040
that it's actually going to be correct

1115
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,000
because

1116
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,040
um

1117
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,839
the uh because we're we're passing

1118
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,319
around the actual updates um including

1119
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,160
the time at which the update occurred

1120
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,079
which lets us validate it so um

1121
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,359
so uh and the other thing is um

1122
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,160
it's

1123
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,880
possible that that uh an srp replication

1124
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,119
peer might have gotten an update

1125
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,720
replicated it around and then gone

1126
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,040
offline and so during rep during during

1127
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,599
the reconciliation process those updates

1128
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:24,640
are still going to be part of the

1129
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,240
reconciliation process even though they

1130
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,839
weren't received by the server that's

1131
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,839
that's offering them because we want to

1132
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,280
make sure that we replicate the whole

1133
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,880
database even if the server that

1134
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,520
originally got the information is gone

1135
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,359
um

1136
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,680
so and then once we're up to date uh

1137
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,280
then whenever appear gets an update it

1138
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,680
just sends it to the other peers um and

1139
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,319
whenever and so from the perspective of

1140
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,400
an individual peer it's sending updates

1141
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,440
whenever it gets an update and

1142
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,720
occasionally it receives updates from

1143
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,160
other peers we don't expect this to

1144
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,160
happen a lot but you know

1145
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,119
happens

1146
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,400
from time to time

1147
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,400
and during this period we don't do

1148
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,720
secondhand updates because at this point

1149
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,680
these are live updates so

1150
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,880
so if something goes wrong in this

1151
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,319
process it's basically going to have to

1152
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,240
be resolved at the srp level not at the

1153
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,920
replication level but

1154
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,000
generally speaking it's you know

1155
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,680
usually stuff won't go wrong in the

1156
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,599
situation

1157
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,000
so that's the basic protocol

1158
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,240
uh

1159
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,680
current statuses we have two

1160
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,040
implementations uh there's an

1161
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,200
implementation if you if you have tvos

1162
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,319
15 which is the current release

1163
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,720
that has this code running in it um

1164
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,480
slightly different version than than

1165
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,720
what's documented but uh

1166
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,319
you know that's sort of par for the

1167
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:37,280
course when you're inventing new

1168
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,319
protocols

1169
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,520
uh open thread has done an

1170
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,200
implementation i haven't looked at the

1171
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,720
implementation yet but i've had some

1172
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,880
conversations with the implementers and

1173
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,240
it sounds like they're doing a great job

1174
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,680
and i'm looking forward to us doing some

1175
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,680
interop at some point

1176
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,359
so um

1177
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,520
so basically uh

1178
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,040
i don't know if i put it no that's so

1179
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,040
basically my goal is to ultimately get

1180
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,720
this work adopted by the working group

1181
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,400
this is probably the biggest ask that

1182
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,680
i'm ever going to make of this working

1183
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,720
group because this is a fairly

1184
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,400
complicated spec

1185
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,160
i think the people who are interested in

1186
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,760
this are more likely to show up here

1187
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,200
than somewhere else so i think this is

1188
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,520
the place to do the work

1189
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,960
you know david made the good point that

1190
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,640
we don't want to overload the working

1191
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,920
group given how many people are

1192
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,200
participating

1193
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,079
um but but this is to me it seems clear

1194
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,599
this is the place to do the work so

1195
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,440
basically

1196
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,119
this is kind of your fair warning that

1197
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,280
this is there's i'm going to be asking

1198
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,119
for adoption at some point

1199
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,240
you know

1200
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,920
if i thought or if i thought david

1201
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,520
wouldn't laugh at me i would ask for

1202
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,040
adoption now but he'll probably laugh at

1203
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,800
me so

1204
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,520
so that's where we are

1205
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,920
so any thoughts from the working group

1206
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,359
just join the queue if you do

1207
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,079
or type in the chat

1208
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,880
i'm going to thank ted for

1209
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,040
bringing this introduction to the group

1210
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,800
and i'm also going to suggest in the

1211
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,119
interest of time that we move on because

1212
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,520
we just have 15 minutes left and i think

1213
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,040
two more

1214
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,800
topics to cover

1215
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,160
yep

1216
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,359
yeah we don't have to make a decision

1217
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,520
right now

1218
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,319
that that sounds good um from the church

1219
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,079
perspective i'd say

1220
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,520
yeah let's uh

1221
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,880
if

1222
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,240
if you could prioritize going through

1223
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,400
the action items you have on the

1224
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,319
adopted working group drafts and those

1225
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,079
look like they're no longer blocked on

1226
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,240
you and making good progress then i

1227
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,240
think you know then and taking a

1228
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,000
co-author then bringing this back i

1229
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,280
think the problem there should be

1230
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,440
appetite at that point as long as we you

1231
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,400
know

1232
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,240
as long as my only concern is i want to

1233
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,359
make sure that this new work doesn't um

1234
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,119
delay the existing work but as long as

1235
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,720
it doesn't do that assuming there are

1236
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,720
multiple folks from different

1237
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,640
uh affiliations that are interested then

1238
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,880
we can definitely consider adopting this

1239
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,440
i'll double check the charter but i'm

1240
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,520
i'm not yet worried i'll double check

1241
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,280
that with our id and everything

1242
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,960
okay cool

1243
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,240
all right um

1244
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,920
so let's see i think the next on the

1245
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,079
agenda is the discovering dns zones

1246
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,599
so actually

1247
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,520
it's discovering an advertising dns zone

1248
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,960
so so

1249
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,560
kind of a crap shoot what what lands in

1250
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,280
the title um so this is some work that

1251
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,119
that i've been working on with another

1252
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,319
uh colleague

1253
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:27,200
uh

1254
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,040
and uh you know there's actually an

1255
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,800
implementation of this in the latest

1256
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,400
version of tvos as well

1257
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,720
the problem is um

1258
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,000
that you know so so our our goal here is

1259
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,480
to be able to discover a lot of services

1260
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,200
on

1261
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,560
and these are these would be like iot

1262
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,119
devices so like light bulbs and outlets

1263
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,680
and sensors and stuff like that you can

1264
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,920
have quite a few of those on a network

1265
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,720
the sort of the original uh model of

1266
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,240
mdns was you were going to discover

1267
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,520
printers or something like that and

1268
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,960
usually you don't have like a thousand

1269
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,319
printers or i mean you probably don't

1270
00:45:58,319 --> 00:45:59,520
have a thousand light bulbs but usually

1271
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,960
you don't have even 50 printers you have

1272
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,880
like maybe two or three

1273
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,839
um

1274
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,119
and with uh with iot you really could

1275
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,119
have like 50 or 100 devices and now you

1276
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,800
do an mdns query you're getting back a

1277
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,240
lot of answers

1278
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,480
and so that's a lot of stuff to be

1279
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,240
putting on multicast

1280
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,119
um

1281
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,280
and so that's one one problem is the

1282
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,960
amount of stuff the other problem is

1283
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,560
that there are devices

1284
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,119
um that like to go to sleep and for them

1285
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:25,920
to

1286
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,200
uh to notice um

1287
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,160
you know

1288
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,880
to to to to have a complete

1289
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,280
set of data about what's going on in in

1290
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,640
md s

1291
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,760
um

1292
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,079
they have to they have to be

1293
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,920
either listening all the time or they

1294
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,400
have to like do a point query but even

1295
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,599
then there's no guarantee they're going

1296
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:46,880
to get all the data

1297
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,640
um and so

1298
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,680
so being able to to have a

1299
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,359
tcp connection

1300
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:57,040
that is open and doing dns push um is a

1301
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,359
lot cleaner solution to both of these

1302
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,119
uh to both of these

1303
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,240
issues

1304
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,440
um

1305
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,839
and so what we propose to do the problem

1306
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,440
is of course what we'd like is to be

1307
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,960
able to just advertise the stuff to the

1308
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,400
infrastructure have the infrastructure

1309
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,319
pick it up delegate the domain and then

1310
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,160
have have all the discovery stuff sort

1311
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,000
of work and

1312
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,240
that's certainly our end goal but in the

1313
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,240
meantime we also need to be able to have

1314
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,359
this stuff work even if the

1315
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:22,800
infrastructure doesn't support it which

1316
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,520
at the moment it definitely doesn't so

1317
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,680
uh so the way to do that is to advertise

1318
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,440
the zone using mdns

1319
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,559
um

1320
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,880
so essentially or you know and and by

1321
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,960
extension dnssd

1322
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,280
so um

1323
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,200
so we we still using mdns but we're only

1324
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,599
doing one query instead of 50. so it's a

1325
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,280
big improvement and also like you know

1326
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,960
if you're if you're using a device that

1327
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,359
sleeps a lot um your iphone or your

1328
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,040
watch or you know i'm sure there are

1329
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,720
equivalent products and other

1330
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,720
from other companies um

1331
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,040
then uh

1332
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,839
dns push is a much uh

1333
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,839
it's much easier to make that work even

1334
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,520
if you have to re-establish a connection

1335
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,359
every time you wake up you can get a

1336
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,040
complete list of all of the data that

1337
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,119
you want to know about very easily but

1338
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,040
ideally the connection just survives

1339
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,480
your sleeps because you're sleeping

1340
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,920
momentarily right you're like sleeping

1341
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,079
for a second at a time and waking up

1342
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,599
every second or something like that and

1343
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:16,720
so

1344
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,559
so when there's an update you'll just

1345
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,079
get it as soon as you reconnect and the

1346
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,920
wi-fi the wi-fi base station will

1347
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,680
probably have remembered it for you

1348
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,558
so um

1349
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,359
so uh the way this works we have to

1350
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,040
choose a name that won't appear that

1351
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,559
it's never going to appear in the dns so

1352
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,960
we actually need to create a new a new

1353
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,240
name like uh home.rpa but something

1354
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,440
that's specifically for this purpose yes

1355
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,960
just add something which i don't think

1356
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,480
you actually said

1357
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,920
um

1358
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,160
the idea here is that instead of

1359
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,319
multicasting a query to every device on

1360
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:51,839
the network

1361
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,800
the client that wants to do discovery

1362
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,040
talks to a server using unicast which is

1363
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,280
much more efficient on wi-fi

1364
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,839
and the bootstrapping issue is how does

1365
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,119
it figure out

1366
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,359
what entity on the network is the

1367
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,640
unicast server it should be talking to

1368
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,319
yeah or to put it slightly differently

1369
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,240
what entities on the network are

1370
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,480
available that can act as that unicast

1371
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,680
server because there might be more than

1372
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,960
one

1373
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:17,920
um

1374
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,480
so anyway so so so the the idea is we

1375
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,000
don't want to create a security

1376
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,960
vulnerability here by allowing

1377
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,880
arbitrary devices on your network to use

1378
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,559
mdns to override your dns configuration

1379
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,040
so therefore we'll allocate a zone

1380
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,119
that's only for this purpose and so

1381
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,480
it'll just be devices that are doing the

1382
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,000
same thing competing with each other and

1383
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,359
if one of them is malicious that's not

1384
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,119
great but at least it's not going to be

1385
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,040
able to like you know

1386
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,880
do a man-in-the-middle attack on your

1387
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,040
bank transaction or something like that

1388
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,960
um

1389
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,520
so uh and then uh basically the idea is

1390
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,359
you advertise data sets that you have so

1391
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,359
you might have an srp database data set

1392
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,880
if you're doing srp replication you

1393
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,559
might have one or more discovery proxy

1394
00:49:58,559 --> 00:49:59,440
links

1395
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,480
um

1396
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,240
and so if you have any of those you just

1397
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,400
advertise them with mdns the client goes

1398
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,400
out and tries to find the list of zones

1399
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,680
that that have

1400
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,520
data sets it cares about

1401
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,359
and um

1402
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,680
and then uh

1403
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,480
so when a when a dnssd query comes in

1404
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,480
that doesn't specify what

1405
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,160
domain to look in you you know sometimes

1406
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,000
the query will specify looking.local and

1407
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,319
then you only look with mdns but but if

1408
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,319
the query doesn't specify a particular

1409
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:27,280
domain

1410
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,440
then uh then we're going to set up the

1411
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,920
browsing domains so that so that this

1412
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,839
these zones that we've discovered are

1413
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,800
browsing domains and so we'll now do dns

1414
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,400
push queries to get answers in those

1415
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,800
domains

1416
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,640
and so uh

1417
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,520
and and the idea is that that any server

1418
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,359
that's advertising a particular data set

1419
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,599
should work so data set could be an srp

1420
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,440
replication data set

1421
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,400
uh

1422
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,920
where data set could be a discovery

1423
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,960
proxy

1424
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,920
uh

1425
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,800
link

1426
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,559
and in both of those cases srp

1427
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,119
replication gives you a uniform data set

1428
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,720
whichever server you talk to and

1429
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,480
discovery proxy gives you a uniform data

1430
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,559
set because you're using mdns on a

1431
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,760
particular link and so any mdns

1432
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,280
client on a particular link is going to

1433
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,960
see the same information

1434
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,319
so it doesn't matter which server you

1435
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,640
connect to in either of these cases

1436
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,520
um

1437
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,640
so current status there's an

1438
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,359
implementation in tbos um

1439
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,760
the current implementation is not doing

1440
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,440
exactly what i think we should do it's

1441
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,240
using ns records and advertising legacy

1442
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,240
browsing domains and

1443
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,200
it only works with mdns um

1444
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,839
and

1445
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:38,079
my for you know after after having

1446
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,359
played with that for a while i came to

1447
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:40,800
the conclusion that we probably wanted

1448
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,559
to just advertise this as a service so

1449
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,640
the service will say hi i'm a service

1450
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,000
that that does

1451
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,800
uh you know you can use to do to do dns

1452
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,599
push

1453
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,839
and here here are here are the databases

1454
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,200
that i replicate

1455
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,200
and uh or here here are the data sets

1456
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,559
that you can query

1457
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:57,620
and um

1458
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,040
[Music]

1459
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,559
and then just kind of have the plumbing

1460
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,640
be done based on that

1461
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,599
so um and then also an additional

1462
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,599
service that could be advertised is

1463
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,240
discovery proxy for this link

1464
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,359
so now

1465
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:14,160
uh if again if you have a sleepy device

1466
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,920
um it can just connect to the discovery

1467
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,920
proxy for this link and get the same

1468
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,599
information that it would get

1469
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,000
um if it were doing mdns itself except

1470
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,680
without having to do the having to be

1471
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,280
awake all the time

1472
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,400
so

1473
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,640
uh so that's where we are uh the request

1474
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,640
of the working group is you know please

1475
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,200
take a look at this comment on it and

1476
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,440
again at some point i'd like to

1477
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,280
recommend this for adoption

1478
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,800
um

1479
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,640
so

1480
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,160
that's that

1481
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,319
does anyone have questions or comments

1482
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:45,680
on this document

1483
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,480
please join the mic line now

1484
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,400
um otherwise

1485
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,480
i think in terms of conclusion kind of

1486
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,160
similar to the

1487
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,800
previous draft

1488
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,720
if we you know looks like we're making

1489
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,960
good progress on the existing work

1490
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,880
and potentially if you i would encourage

1491
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,040
you to find a co-author with a different

1492
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,559
affiliation on this one as well i think

1493
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:07,920
that'd be helpful

1494
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,839
um it sounds like you know you're using

1495
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,240
this for your

1496
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,359
matter technology is that correct or

1497
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,839
so uh

1498
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,440
sure

1499
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,119
okay well

1500
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,160
if this is being used by uh like for for

1501
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,079
us who will want to adopt this is

1502
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:27,440
the implication would be that it's a

1503
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,839
general purpose specification that

1504
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,160
everyone so and that's that's the

1505
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,800
intention my goal here is actually to to

1506
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,599
so remember like i was trying to do the

1507
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:39,359
home net naming architecture back in the

1508
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:40,319
day

1509
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,400
and that basically failed because we

1510
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,000
tried to bite off too big a chunk at

1511
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,240
once so what i'm trying to do is address

1512
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,680
each of the things that we want the home

1513
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,079
net naming architecture to do piecemeal

1514
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,160
so you could say well you know it's a

1515
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,079
matter specific thing but no it's not

1516
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:57,280
the idea is to to fill in all of those

1517
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,359
little building blocks so that then we

1518
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:00,960
get to the point where we actually can

1519
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,720
have what we were trying to do in the

1520
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,800
beginning with the naming architecture

1521
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,240
so so

1522
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,319
it's more that i'm using matter as an

1523
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:11,040
excuse to to to to

1524
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,280
succeed in this hobby then it is the

1525
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,240
opposite

1526
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,440
but

1527
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,400
that makes perfect sense um i'm just

1528
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,839
saying like

1529
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,839
for us to you know adopt this the goal

1530
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:22,960
would be to

1531
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,880
have interest for various folks if it's

1532
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,800
just a protocol between an iphone and

1533
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,040
apple tv then you don't need a working

1534
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,520
group document obviously yeah that makes

1535
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,880
sense david

1536
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,720
let me answer your question

1537
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,040
um actually i want to start off by

1538
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,119
thanking ted for the enormous amount of

1539
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:40,960
work he's done both on coding and

1540
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,440
debugging and writing the documents too

1541
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,280
i also want to thank chris box for

1542
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,880
stepping up as a new co-chair

1543
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,960
the reason ted has been working so hard

1544
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,799
is because there is a lot of use for

1545
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,880
this and there's lots of activity going

1546
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,520
on outside the ietf

1547
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,359
uh we are trying to encourage those

1548
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:02,559
people to engage with the ietf

1549
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,200
one thing that some people in this group

1550
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,760
know about but many will not is the work

1551
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,839
going on with thread

1552
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,680
threads quarter make a bit wireless mesh

1553
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,760
technology for home devices like light

1554
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,200
switches and motion sensors and

1555
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,480
thermostats

1556
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,760
and on that network thread is using srp

1557
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,480
to reduce the reliance on multicast

1558
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,079
which we know works very poorly on

1559
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,400
wireless networks

1560
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,799
thread is being used by mata

1561
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,960
which used to go by the working title

1562
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,319
project chip connected home over ip

1563
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,640
and that work is done by the csa the

1564
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,799
connectivity standards alliance which

1565
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:40,319
also changed its name that used to be

1566
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:41,839
the zigbee alliance

1567
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,520
and it changed its name recently to

1568
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,760
reflect its new focus on ip technologies

1569
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,240
so mata will be using thread as one of

1570
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,119
its lower layers it's also using wi-fi

1571
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,599
people in mata are looking at the work

1572
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,480
done on thread using unicast discovery

1573
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,720
to make it more reliable

1574
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,599
and less expensive on the network

1575
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,440
and there's now been discussions about

1576
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,520
we should do the same for wi-fi wi-fi

1577
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,280
access points should all have srp

1578
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,880
servers in them

1579
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:11,599
so

1580
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,200
i'm not pre-announcing anything there

1581
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,799
because this is a long way from being

1582
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:16,480
done but there's already discussions

1583
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,760
going on there

1584
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,160
that mata would like to see wi-fi doing

1585
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,200
slp just like thread is so

1586
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,119
there's a ton of stuff and this is what

1587
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,680
is keeping ted busy with with so many

1588
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,799
groups interested in this and and i'm

1589
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,240
mentioning this because

1590
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,000
all of that is largely invisible in the

1591
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
ietf to people who are not involved with

1592
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,240
those groups and we are

1593
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,720
actively trying to educate those people

1594
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,839
about ietf and

1595
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,200
uh explain to them how they can

1596
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,919
participate

1597
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,319
thanks for the backup stuart and thanks

1598
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,160
for like doing that work i think having

1599
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,799
a fresh set of new eyes and new ideas in

1600
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:56,480
the working group is always a good thing

1601
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,760
so that's what we're looking for in

1602
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,559
terms of bringing uh new work uh great

1603
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,640
all right so ted you have your last

1604
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,040
document we have four minutes left and i

1605
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,200
want to keep like one for the chairs so

1606
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,280
if you could just zoom through it please

1607
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,359
go ahead yep i will do my best um so uh

1608
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:16,319
so the issue is that we have um

1609
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,400
a problem when we have srp replication

1610
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,720
or when we have enter

1611
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,559
independent advertising proxies which is

1612
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,240
that we can get conflicts

1613
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,000
even though what's actually happened is

1614
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
a legitimate update um mdns uh

1615
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,760
assumes that uh

1616
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,400
if something has registered a service

1617
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,839
and something else comes along and tries

1618
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,440
to ever register a service under the

1619
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,480
same name that the something else is uh

1620
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,079
the interloper and should be rejected

1621
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:43,839
and the original should stay but with a

1622
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,359
proxy

1623
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,200
the new update is

1624
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,960
we're able to validate with srp that it

1625
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,640
came from the same device so it's not an

1626
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,799
interloper it's the same device but we

1627
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:55,839
still get a conflict and so the idea is

1628
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,760
in the case of proxies to have a

1629
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,599
resource record that's mdns specific um

1630
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,920
that just says when we got the update so

1631
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,440
that if we get so when we send an mdns

1632
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,400
probe

1633
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,119
um we include that information and then

1634
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,079
uh an mdns server that has uh that's

1635
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:15,680
doing the same thing

1636
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,000
sees that probe uh and sees that there

1637
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,920
is a conflict but that the new

1638
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,920
information is that the information

1639
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,839
being advertised is newer

1640
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:25,520
then it's going to

1641
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,880
uh not

1642
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,200
report a conflict because the new and

1643
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,200
the information is newer and so it'll

1644
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,960
ultimately just drop the information the

1645
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,280
stale information that it has and

1646
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,640
allow the new information to be

1647
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,880
advertised and with srp replication of

1648
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,480
course ultimately both of them will wind

1649
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,559
up advertising the same information but

1650
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,079
this gives us this just prevents all

1651
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,640
these messy conflicts that can occur and

1652
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,240
the renamings that can occur so so uh as

1653
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,839
requested i don't think there's a reason

1654
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:53,520
to go into too much more detail about

1655
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,680
that the slides are up on the

1656
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,040
on the server

1657
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,400
um

1658
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,160
and uh of course you can read the

1659
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,599
document which i think explains the

1660
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,040
situation pretty well

1661
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,799
uh so the request to the working group

1662
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,359
is uh to take a look at this uh it's

1663
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:10,319
pretty simple i think it's pretty

1664
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:11,760
necessary for actually for the

1665
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,240
advertising proxy work so i think

1666
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,920
we we want to include this in the

1667
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,599
advertising proxy

1668
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,160
work um but i don't think this is a

1669
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,760
really big task for the working group i

1670
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,839
mean i wrote this up in like you know

1671
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:25,680
an hour and i

1672
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,280
i'm sure that it can use some review but

1673
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,599
i think it's pretty solid so

1674
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:30,799
um

1675
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,960
so that's where we are and you have a

1676
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,280
minute

1677
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,440
all right thank you ted uh we're gonna

1678
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,799
take questions on this specific

1679
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,030
presentation to the list um

1680
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:44,799
[Music]

1681
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:47,520
boop uh

1682
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,839
and then put these back

1683
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:52,559
there done um all right so uh and i

1684
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:54,799
think uh same kind of conclusion as the

1685
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,280
other ones uh ted this looks interesting

1686
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,040
it appears to be in scope

1687
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,280
uh especially if uh

1688
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,359
in the context of advertising proxy if

1689
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:04,880
the working group thinks that

1690
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,240
advertising processes should have a

1691
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,640
dependency on this that'll help motivate

1692
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,000
bring it in but

1693
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,160
similar to the previous ones we want to

1694
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,160
see progress on the other drafts and we

1695
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,400

01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,720
