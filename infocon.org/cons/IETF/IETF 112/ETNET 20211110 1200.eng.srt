00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,720
have been good discussions i'm really

176
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,560
glad for for that

177
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,360
and uh we have opportunities for virtual

178
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,560
meetings in addition to the regular ietf

179
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,599
meetings

180
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,400
as as needed we can schedule interview

181
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,800
meetings uh as we just had uh recently

182
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,080
and uh we can also have informal working

183
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,919
meetings to advance our documents

184
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,800
we

185
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,080
used to do this for data plane and then

186
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,039
for yang actually now the young has been

187
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,879
completed and the one

188
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,960
that is ongoing and we we have a

189
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,199
bi-weekly meetings on the progressing

190
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,400
the oem work so these meetings can be

191
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,520
set up by by the chairs and please reach

192
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,800
out to us if

193
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,840
you see

194
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,039
uh other topics that should be discussed

195
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,520
or would be beneficial for the group to

196
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
be discussed um

197
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,440
either way in our interim or in informal

198
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,319
working meetings we can we can set up

199
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,160
those meetings

200
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,800
and this was the last slide as the intro

201
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,840
any questions

202
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,919
okay hitting none then let's move to the

203
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,479
first presentation

204
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,399
from greg

205
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,519
yes thank you um

206
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,720
good morning and um so this is an update

207
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,080
on uh

208
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,959
our

209
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,839
framework for

210
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,120
operation administration maintenance

211
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,880
in a dead net

212
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,680
next or at least

213
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,600
so in

214
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,959
111 meeting uh the working group

215
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,480
agreed to uh merge um

216
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,399
part of their

217
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,399
um

218
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,200
draft into this uh document um on

219
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,320
oem requirements for uh that net service

220
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,640
sublayer layer and uh we welcome uh

221
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,360
balash indiana as a coffers

222
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,000
uh we continue discussing uh documents

223
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,560
related to that net oem in our bi-weekly

224
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,279
meetings and uh thanks janice

225
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,320
for leading these discussions

226
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,399
so there are more significant updates as

227
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,160
mentioned so we integrated these

228
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,279
requirements for deadlift subnet

229
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,600
service sub layer

230
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,519
and now are the requirements in the

231
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,360
document structured

232
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,480
in three groups uh general.net oem

233
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,839
requirements

234
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:00,800
uh

235
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,440
requirements for forwarding sub layer

236
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,040
and for service sub layer

237
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,720
next slide please

238
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,760
so among uh general requirements and

239
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,240
this is not a complete list it's just

240
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,800
the highlights

241
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,920
so the oem sessions are between that net

242
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,360
uh

243
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,680
maintenance

244
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,399
and points

245
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,640
uh

246
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,839
supporting uh and should be you able to

247
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,399
use a proactive and on demand monitoring

248
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,040
and measurement

249
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,519
and uh proactive is uh something that is

250
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,839
uh continuous and

251
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:48,959
periodic

252
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,800
uh using uh

253
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,399
probe packets

254
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,880
and on demand it's more understanded

255
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,800
it's basically initiated by

256
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,519
an operator and it has a

257
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,440
terminal

258
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,640
lifetime of the test session

259
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,320
um

260
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,959
must support unidirectional oem methods

261
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,000
for example as continuity check and

262
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,920
measure packet delay and packet class

263
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,880
also support uh oem for bi-directional

264
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,760
deadman flows

265
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,839
next slide please

266
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,880
uh for the forwarding sub layer

267
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,720
um

268
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,760
be able to do path uh

269
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,480
mtu uh discovery

270
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,600
be able to use a remote defect indicator

271
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,839
support monitoring levels for resources

272
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,920
allocated for the given that net flow

273
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,399
and for example these resources

274
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,800
are include but not limited to

275
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,120
buffer location and transmit schedule of

276
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,680
calendar

277
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,160
support monitoring any step path

278
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,920
traversed by the particular deadline

279
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,240
flow

280
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,760
next slide please

281
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,760
uh for the service sub layer so that is

282
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,720
the part that we integrated and it's new

283
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,800
to this document it's not new it's been

284
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,160
discussed uh

285
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,920
by the working group but in this

286
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,240
document that's an update

287
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,600
um so oem functions for that net sub uh

288
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,000
service sub layer

289
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and support discovery of the dead net

290
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,639
relay nodes and uh in a service sub

291
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,839
layer these relay nodes are

292
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,760
node that met nodes that

293
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,680
implement support

294
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,519
one of the packet replication

295
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,839
elimination and or the preservation sub

296
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,839
functions

297
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,880
support the collection of that net

298
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,880
service sub layer specific information

299
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
and that specific information

300
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,600
is related uh to the pre-op sub

301
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,720
functions and relay nodes

302
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,839
support the ability of exercising

303
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,760
functionality of packet replication

304
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,839
elimination and oil preservation

305
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,040
functions

306
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,320
and

307
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,600
that is

308
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,680
really important because

309
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,639
this is a new mechanism and listed new

310
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,560
mechanism for oem

311
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,240
and it requires

312
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,160
additional special

313
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,680
instrumentation

314
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,760
for

315
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,839
probe

316
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,720
packet and ability to control

317
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,480
uh this

318
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,360
sub functions pre-offset functions

319
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,160
support to use alarm indication signal

320
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,040
between that net relay nodes and so that

321
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,800
is important uh then uh discovering a

322
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,240
defect on um

323
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,000
service layer and indicating uh the

324
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,360
propagating

325
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,600
our medication signal to the

326
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,720
client sub layer

327
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,040
support performance monitoring in a dead

328
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,160
service sub layer with a pre-off

329
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,719
in use

330
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,040
any questions

331
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
about their requirements and the

332
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,320
structure

333
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,519
of the document because that is new as

334
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,320
we

335
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,920
added um

336
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,600
there is section on the service sub

337
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,240
layer so we

338
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,540
separate it

339
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,639
[Music]

340
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,480
into the general and the forwarding sub

341
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,800
layer yes

342
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,720
uh lou you have a question a comment

343
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,680
can you hear me

344
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,800
no yes

345
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,880
ah okay i muted that guy yeah he did it

346
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,360
backwards sorry um you're you have a

347
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,959
metric section that seems a little light

348
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,320
my expectations are going to beef that

349
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,480
up um while you're doing that i think

350
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,040
you're it would be good to have um

351
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,360
requirements for each of the metrics

352
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,040
that you're talking about you know

353
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
whether the metric is required or not or

354
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,839
you know it must should may

355
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,000
that's it okay

356
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,320
thank you

357
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,160
okay uh next slide please

358
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,279
so while we were

359
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,800
working on

360
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,199
the requirements we found

361
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,040
several open issues that we

362
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,920
consider not to be entirely editorial

363
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,480
and that's why

364
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,800
we are uh highlighting them uh in the

365
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,160
presentation and uh one working group uh

366
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,120
to

367
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,199
uh discuss it

368
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,720
um so the hybrid oem and that's uh using

369
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,480
their classification rfc 7799

370
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,320
and as a

371
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,279
oem measurement method that combines uh

372
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,920
passive active uh measurements

373
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,880
um

374
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,120
is often represented by on path

375
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,800
telemetry methods such as for example in

376
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,920
situ oem and alternate marking method

377
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,480
and telemetry information um

378
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,199
can be collected and transported in

379
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,519
banded out of bank so the example of

380
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,720
invent is one of their

381
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,560
options trace options

382
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,399
documented in oem as

383
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,079
where the information is collected in

384
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,880
packets either hub by hub or and by uh

385
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,920
to end

386
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,399
uh so hop by hub it's a

387
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,759
transit notes uh iom nodes uh add uh

388
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,120
requested telemetry information in the

389
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,079
data packet that serves as a trigger and

390
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,279
end to end as an ingress and igor's only

391
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,320
um

392
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,000
collect information

393
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,839
uh but in addition there are out of band

394
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,160
methods so where their

395
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,119
information is uh

396
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,959
stored locally

397
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,599
either for direct exporting uh

398
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,839
immediately or for

399
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,720
um

400
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,640
aggregation processing and exporting of

401
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,160
some calculated uh performance uh

402
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,280
metrics

403
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,400
and uh so this um

404
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,199
uh out of band methods can be either

405
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,319
using

406
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,679
um

407
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,880
yank data model so they use

408
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,280
in combination with a model driven

409
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,480
telemetry

410
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,320
uh or use

411
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,559
some other methods

412
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,520
well known like grpc

413
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,760
kafka

414
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,120
uh else

415
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,720
so um

416
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,600
what we're asking is that the current

417
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,039
document states that that net oem may

418
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,960
support hybrid performance measurement

419
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,240
methods but in our discussions we agreed

420
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,480
that uh

421
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,039
these methods can provide valuable and

422
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,440
important information especially

423
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,400
uh important for uh streaming telemetry

424
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,440
information that used uh for network

425
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,559
analytics

426
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,679
and uh then in

427
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,559
combination with out-of-band uh

428
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,080
collection entrance um of information uh

429
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,520
provided important and uh valuable uh

430
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,080
operational uh mechanism so the our

431
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,640
proposal is that makes support of the

432
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,960
hybrid measurement methods mandatory so

433
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,000
to change

434
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,600
must

435
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,440
and we understand that this discussion

436
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,960
uh

437
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,600
to be on the mailing list and uh

438
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,240
i would like a working group uh to

439
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,160
discuss it and um

440
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,840
come to some conclusion

441
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,160
uh so further are we proposing to

442
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,720
splitting um the requirement that

443
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,679
combines proactive and on-demand oem

444
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,440
into two requirements

445
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,039
uh that

446
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,960
just the convenience because um

447
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,080
it's much easier to

448
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,280
evaluate the conformance and then uh

449
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,200
when we are talking about

450
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,760
uh if we need the new mechanisms or

451
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,799
we're uh doing a gap analysis

452
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,480
and we're uh

453
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,840
need to do the checklist

454
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,559
uh attribute uh to

455
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,039
two separate requirements rather than

456
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,080
just say okay that's uh this mechanism

457
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,320
can be used for the part of this uh

458
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,039
requirement that is confusing

459
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,200
and uh another is um what we found is

460
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,000
like thought is inconsistency but we uh

461
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,720
discussed it

462
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,679
um

463
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,039
so it's

464
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,200
uh two requirements in the general

465
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,880
session um

466
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,559
are related to unidirectional

467
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,320
performance measurements

468
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,240
and uh they seem as duplicate

469
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,159
so and uh

470
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,200
yeah actually it's like in a second and

471
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,760
it should be ten not in first sentence

472
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,799
and eleven

473
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,200
um so we just uh want to remove the

474
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,600
first sentence

475
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,840
so that's uh probably more editorial

476
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,799
and next slide please

477
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,720
so we'll continue our uh bi-weekly

478
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,280
discussion and uh everyone is welcome uh

479
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,640
to join um so this is our open um

480
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,000
calls

481
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,600
uh please comment uh review the document

482
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,520
and uh we think that we are getting

483
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,840
close to the stable document and uh

484
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,720
probably

485
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,000
uh

486
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,240
at some point uh before the next meeting

487
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,440
uh

488
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,000
will uh be ready for the working dual

489
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,919
bus call

490
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,240
thank you

491
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,600
any comments questions

492
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,080
uh greg i'd like to go back for a moment

493
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,480
to your this hybrid discussion

494
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,520
yes uh

495
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,720
the so uh you made two comments here

496
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,799
about uh um

497
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,400
one is about off path or out of band

498
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,520
um so we have had uh in

499
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,919
um sort of traffic engineering we've

500
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,200
done a lot of out of band um uh for the

501
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,559
response

502
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,360
and

503
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,480
uh response messages or for feedback you

504
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,799
know so on on path or in band for

505
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,559
forward and then

506
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,000
off uh out of band off path for reverse

507
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,880
um

508
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,320
we need bi-directional messaging and

509
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,760
you're doing one-way

510
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,440
oam

511
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
that definition is a little different

512
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,039
than rfc 77's 99's definition of

513
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,159
out-of-band

514
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,960
uh for them they use out-of-band to talk

515
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,640
about act uh active and passive

516
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,240
so when they're talking hybrid they're

517
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,640
talking passive monitoring versus active

518
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,720
monitoring

519
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,760
um

520
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,600
well so 77.99 they they they they have

521
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,880
actually the two types of hybrid uh but

522
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,120
um

523
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,919
it's it's

524
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,760
their the title of the

525
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,360
rfc is

526
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,799
active passive in in between

527
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,440
so um

528
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,240
um

529
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,760
itself

530
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,039
uh the

531
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,000
hybrid methods that use

532
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,799
some

533
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,120
that add some information to the data

534
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,240
packet

535
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,280
are

536
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,280
hybrid because uh they need to um

537
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,880
mark packets

538
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,600
uh as in alternate marking methods to

539
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,799
create the flow of uh

540
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,440
marked packets that identify changes in

541
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,720
batches

542
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,559
and uh iam which inserts it as a minimum

543
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,600
inserts the header that indicates and

544
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,799
lists uh

545
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,640
of

546
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,640
informational elements that needs to be

547
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
collected um

548
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,960
and a node or requested to be collected

549
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,159
at the node

550
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,400
um so

551
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,440
uh their collection methods out of band

552
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,559
uh here is uh

553
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,400
interpreted as being uh out of band

554
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,640
relative to the monitored uh data flow

555
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,080
yeah i think i think we can have more

556
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,080
discussion on this maybe on the list

557
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,200
but i think for um you know out of band

558
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,760
for responses is something that's you

559
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,440
know well established

560
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,400
and

561
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,240
certainly we're going to want to support

562
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,640
and so the requirement all looks good

563
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,840
actually i think the text in the

564
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,360
document is pretty good it's really just

565
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,120
your characterization here that i had an

566
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,880
issue with okay

567
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,159
the the other thing is that telemetry is

568
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,720
usually about monitoring of oam not the

569
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,159
oem itself

570
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,720
and um you don't use telemetry in the

571
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,159
dock document right now at least i

572
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,000
didn't notice you're using it um

573
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,080
actually you do use it

574
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,600
i'll have to read what you mean by

575
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,880
telemetry uh because um the

576
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,799
the examples you gave are more about

577
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,799
monitoring oem than actual oem right

578
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,039
um

579
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,159
again um so the telemetry um

580
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,919
usually differentiate uh two components

581
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,480
uh so they're uh generating telemetry

582
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,880
information and um

583
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,919
uh

584
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,559
collecting transporting uh such

585
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,919
information

586
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,240
and

587
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,000
their

588
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
protocols that used so can be

589
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,720
attributed or characterized as uh on

590
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,120
path telemetry information because uh

591
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,520
the other methods that uh now we

592
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,799
discussed are uh model driven um

593
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,080
telemetry

594
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,720
that is um

595
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,919
based on yank push

596
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,760
right and that's more about getting that

597
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,000
to a central controller or to some

598
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,039
monitoring than to do the oam

599
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,960
on along the data path mm-hmm and i

600
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,840
think

601
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
those concepts

602
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,159
in a way that for me at least is quite

603
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,360
confusing

604
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,240
oh i'm sorry um yes i i didn't mention

605
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,200
because i didn't go um

606
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,600
into details of uh what's being

607
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,039
discussed now uh by ippm working group

608
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,240
so uh there is a a

609
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,240
very uh

610
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,679
useful uh proposal of uh iom direct

611
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,960
expert so uh where um

612
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,760
the information indicated in the data

613
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,559
packet that telemetry information to be

614
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,279
uh stored for the local processing so

615
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,760
not to collect in a data packet but uh

616
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,520
just to generate originate this

617
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,039
information and then uh their processing

618
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,600
is uh

619
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,240
determined by the local policy so it

620
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,640
could be either exported directly uh

621
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,799
from the packet to the collector and the

622
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,360
collector can be again uh the collector

623
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,480
can be in the eager ingress node uh or

624
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,000
egress node of uh the monitored floor or

625
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,760
as you said that it could be a some

626
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,640
controller that will use it for uh

627
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,440
network analytics

628
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,520
yeah that that discussion would be great

629
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,039
to bring in here because that's the

630
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,200
context of how you're using telemetry so

631
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,120
if that's how you mean to use it

632
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,960
you know i i think bringing it into the

633
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,320
document making that clear would be

634
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,279
great

635
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,840
okay okay we'll work on that

636
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,760
okay thank you

637
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,320
okay hi uh

638
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,480
vargo is speaking and on behalf of the

639
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,200
counters i will present uh

640
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,600
this draft which is oem for the net

641
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,360
service sub layer

642
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,158
next slide please

643
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,000
so there is this draft is uh

644
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,279
has the intention to to collect uh

645
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,559
the service sub layer specific oem

646
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,840
topics

647
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,720
and

648
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,480
the text is targeted to be moved to

649
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,279
virgo drafts and this is what

650
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,159
greg was in the previous

651
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,559
slot highlighted that some texts were

652
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,520
already

653
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,159
moved from this draft to the oem

654
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,640
framework document

655
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,279
this document is focusing only on the

656
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,200
service sub-layer oem so

657
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,399
forwarding sub-layer oem is out of scope

658
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,480
in this document and we are currently at

659
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,960
version 01

660
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,159
and next slide days

661
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,279
the next slide is showing uh what is the

662
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,600
content of the draft and there were

663
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,440
updates made

664
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,919
so section 4 this is what were already

665
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,720
moved to the oem framework document

666
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,159
section 5

667
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,440
dealing with

668
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,080
that net ping which is describing oem

669
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,559
processing at the.net service sub layer

670
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,279
so what a relay node should do when it

671
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,000
is serving that net oem

672
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,279
packet

673
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,840
the new text is added based on the

674
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,600
weekly discussions

675
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,640
uh uh about uh

676
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,240
the service sub layer oem challenges so

677
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,399
we have added uh illustrator

678
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,399
illustrative example uh just a very uh

679
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,440
simple network uh which is uh which can

680
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,399
be very useful during discussion of oem

681
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,600
related issues and challenges

682
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,200
uh we have also added a subsection

683
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,520
dealing with that net service sub layer

684
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,200
specifics but by it is uh somewhat

685
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,000
specific for for oem

686
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
uh there is also a section dealing with

687
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,840
what information

688
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,159
needed when that net oem packet is

689
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,159
processed so this information have to

690
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,960
travel with the oem packet

691
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,360
and there was also a section added about

692
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,520
a possible format of the net ach

693
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,320
next slide please

694
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,080
the this slide is just summarizing this

695
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
this new text

696
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,080
and this is as i said

697
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,559
mainly the outcome of the of the weekly

698
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,760
discussion

699
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,679
uh and the discussion on the list about

700
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,279
oem

701
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,440
so the service graph

702
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,760
in case of that net it is segmented in

703
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,200
multiple parts

704
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,279
because the the forwarding sub-layer

705
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,200
parts are terminated at the deathnet

706
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,679
relay nodes

707
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,120
and there are some special

708
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,640
characteristics of a deathmatch cellular

709
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,880
because the prior functionalities they

710
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
are acting as a

711
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,600
as a pair pocket protection

712
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,200
and that means that all the parts in a

713
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,440
service sub-layer graph

714
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,080
they are active and they are forwarding

715
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,120
traffic

716
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,200
and they may have a different number of

717
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,799
hops and

718
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,880
as usual it is mandatory to use the

719
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,480
sequence number for for that net series

720
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,399
so the main main challenge is that the

721
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,520
oem packets must follow precisely uh the

722
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,559
same path as the packets of the

723
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,840
corresponding.net data flow

724
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,720
next slide please

725
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,000
this slide is showing a possible format

726
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,120
for the net ach associated channel

727
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,640
header

728
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,360
the associated channel header is is used

729
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,440
for for many years for oem purposes

730
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,559
but its size is limited it is only 32

731
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,159
bits

732
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,279
and if during the discussion of of that

733
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,720
net oem

734
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,679
stuff we have identified

735
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,679
multiple pieces of information which

736
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,480
have to be present in a definite oem

737
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,080
packet

738
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,799
and it would be hard to put all these

739
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,919
information in a 32-bit uh

740
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,840
field

741
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,960
because

742
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
some part is already reserved for other

743
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,880
purposes so the first nibble is 0001

744
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,080
and in the vergio version uh

745
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,640
with version 1 we can highlight that it

746
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,679
is about

747
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,840
that net associated

748
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,840
channel

749
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,720
header

750
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,919
there are

751
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,559
in the in the draft some proposals

752
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,760
regarding

753
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,480
what uh type of information should be

754
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,960
there and for what purposes they might

755
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,120
be used this is something up to

756
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,640
discussion uh the the major uh

757
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,880
uh

758
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,960
conclusion that we wanted to to

759
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,120
highlight with this slide is that uh we

760
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,120
need to add additional 32-bit uh to to

761
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,200
the ach and create that net specific ach

762
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,679
so how how many bits for sequence number

763
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,640
node id session id and so on are used

764
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,840
this is up for further discussion

765
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,200
and level and flags fields are also

766
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,440
something to be to be defined in more

767
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,360
detail and discuss

768
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,840
level would be something to to create

769
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,640
oem domains and flags can be used for

770
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,960
example to

771
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,760
to control uh the

772
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,000
service sub-layer functionalities for a

773
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,519
given uh that net oem packet

774
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,039
um

775
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,919
next slide please

776
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,200
so uh with this update we have included

777
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,080
in the in the draft the proposed changes

778
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,159
and clarifications which were on the

779
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,080
list and during the biblically oem

780
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,039
course

781
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,120
uh we are still looking for further

782
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,919
comments discussion as i said this is a

783
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,080
a discussion

784
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,720
draft in order to

785
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,799
to

786
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,240
help to

787
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,519
make text of the virgo documents so the

788
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,320
target is to have a common understanding

789
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,120
inside the group and and consensus on

790
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,000
the that net ach and that net being

791
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,440
functionalities

792
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,720
and these are practically texts these

793
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,279
sections to be moved to the group

794
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,640
document and here we mean the net mpls

795
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,240
oem document

796
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,640
thank you

797
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,799
any questions

798
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,000
okay i think uh you know that last point

799
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,440
about moving into the working group

800
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,519
document is something would be good to

801
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,880
address early

802
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,880
uh if this belongs in the working group

803
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,320
document it should be there rather than

804
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,960
as a separate document

805
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,120
i don't quite understand why it is a

806
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,960
separate document and the flow of the

807
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,080
two documents are not well aligned and

808
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,519
so having it as a separate document to

809
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,480
me is not

810
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,919
not a positive thing if we're going to

811
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,279
merge it we should

812
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,639
get agreement from the working group and

813
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,560
do it quickly

814
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,359
um i know greg is going to present next

815
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,960
on the working group document it'd be

816
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,679
good to hear his opinion on that as well

817
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,800
okay

818
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,800
thanks

819
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,918
yes um okay so um this will be a very

820
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,000
brief uh update

821
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
uh on uh oem for um that net and with

822
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,399
mpos data plane next slide please

823
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,159
okay so uh we received uh very good

824
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,560
comments from belarus and we addressed

825
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,760
them uh

826
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,720
so

827
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,680
he is

828
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,040
agreed that

829
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,800
everything is much better now and thank

830
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,400
you polish

831
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,079
and

832
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,720
next slide

833
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,520
so that's it um um

834
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,440
yes we you just uh uh heard and um seen

835
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,560
uh the new proposed for uh that net ach

836
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,680
format

837
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,079
and i absolutely agree and uh we

838
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,200
discussed it with bolas and yanash about

839
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,240
how to proceed and we just

840
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,200
felt that it's uh need to be presented

841
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,040
and discussed by the working group and

842
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,359
the working group will decide uh if it

843
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,160
can be merged into their working group

844
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,200
document

845
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,800
so uh please discuss uh also as yamash

846
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,119
mentioned uh in uh

847
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,440
shares update uh at the top of the

848
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,320
meeting um their

849
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,880
new format for that net

850
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,800
ach format was presented as joint pals

851
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,359
mpls and that networking groups meeting

852
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,560
uh that discuss

853
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,320
advancement or new architecture for uh

854
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,680
mpls

855
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,720
uh data plane and uh

856
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,920
that was uh well received and uh what

857
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,320
was uh the good comments is that saying

858
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,200
that oh guys uh great that you are not

859
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,520
asking for another first nibble but

860
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,720
rather use

861
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,240
uh flexibility of uh versioning of

862
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,079
ach

863
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,560
for your purposes and there were no

864
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,200
concerns that we need in other 32-bit

865
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,640
steps and some comments said that oh

866
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,760
now you have more space and you might

867
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,160
increase their um

868
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,680
sequencing

869
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,079
space so match it to

870
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,040
uh detonate control word um that's

871
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,280
something that uh definitely worth uh

872
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,560
considering

873
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,000
uh but will require some uh more work uh

874
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,320
in general again i would

875
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,920
to um

876
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,200
working group uh to discuss whether it

877
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,200
agrees to changing their uh current

878
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,839
format that is documented in the working

879
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,280
group document

880
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,520
adopting uh effectively importing their

881
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,560
text and new format from the individual

882
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,040
draft

883
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,079
and

884
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,280
so i would like the guidance from

885
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,000
working group chairs on how we can

886
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,839
proceed

887
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,720
with this discussion and

888
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,839
arriving at conclusion

889
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,520
okay thank you

890
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,680
it would be good to hear from the group

891
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,680
if there's any

892
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,320
comments or and particularly objections

893
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,839
to

894
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,320
basically moving the technical content

895
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,480
from bellagio's draft into the working

896
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,040
group track

897
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,520
actually i have a

898
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,560
similar question here and also now

899
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,200
from npr's open design team so i don't

900
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,598
know what what's the procedure of this

901
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,640
sorry at least for me you're breaking up

902
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,000
um uh if someone else heard yeah did you

903
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,640
hear the question

904
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,040
not for me for sure

905
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,960
yes it was breaking for me too

906
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,599
if you type it in if you cannot fix the

907
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,200
audio file

908
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,440
yeah fun if you could just type it in

909
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,520
the question into the uh

910
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,880
um

911
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,960
jabber or i don't know if you want to

912
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,720
try again

913
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,598
okay and am i audible again again

914
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,079
or i will

915
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,760
tap it in the in the chat box

916
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,800
i could hear that

917
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,400
fan you actually sounded good there i

918
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,680
don't know if you want to try one last

919
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,919
time

920
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,440
i'm sorry maybe maybe it's the voice is

921
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,920
not good the quality of the voice is not

922
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,720
good

923
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,399
i my i audiobook again

924
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,640
okay

925
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,118
follow up later

926
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,040
uh fan if you want to try one more time

927
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,280
we could try it

928
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,960
if not yeah please please try

929
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,440
okay um do you remember again

930
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,800
yes

931
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,079
okay so a long latency i think

932
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,760
um my question is was the preceding

933
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,760
procedure um between this new

934
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,800
dent ach format imported

935
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,359
and the mprsd open design team

936
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,119
because i think they are they are

937
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,960
relevant

938
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,920
so

939
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,760
do we need to

940
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,160
first follow the mps open design team

941
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,440
result

942
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,760
and then imported

943
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,760
this then that ach format or we import

944
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,480
it first and then

945
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,359
align with the the discussion

946
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,720
of mpl's open design team

947
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,280
yeah i'm i think there are um there are

948
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,839
three things first is the discussion

949
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,240
from npr's working group and the second

950
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,119
is this the discussion of this new that

951
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,119
net sh format

952
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,520
and the third one is the

953
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,319
is to move this um

954
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,720
new format from individual

955
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,720
uh draft to the uh to the mps working

956
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,520
group shaft

957
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,560
yeah i i think the clarification of to

958
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,119
these questions will be helpful thank

959
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,040
you

960
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,200
um

961
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,720
so stewards probably can answer because

962
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,480
in regard to their open design team

963
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,920
or

964
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,480
stuart were you going to try to respond

965
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,079
yeah i was what i was i was going to

966
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,640
talk to this subject um

967
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,079
so in terms of the the the ownership in

968
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,560
inverted commerce of the structure of

969
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,960
nibble one aches

970
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,000
that probably belongs in pals which is

971
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,560
where we created it in the first place

972
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,800
no one has no one has

973
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,880
found any use for those reserve bits in

974
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,119
the last 20 years so

975
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,040
um we can think about

976
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,599
making them essentially a parameter of

977
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,000
the um channel type which i think is

978
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
what was uh what was shown assuming i'm

979
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,839
we're all talking about the same thing

980
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,680
but i think it would be as well to sort

981
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,000
of socialize this in the sort of

982
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,119
pals mpls space um

983
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,960
uh just to make sure that no one in

984
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,400
particular the pal side of it to make

985
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,800
sure that no one can think of any uh

986
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,920
serious

987
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,160
long-term issues for doing that but the

988
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,560
principle of making those reserve bits a

989
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,440
um

990
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,119
a parameter of the channel type is

991
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,960
probably okay which i think is what you

992
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,520
were proposing

993
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,079
so i think

994
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:46,960
going

995
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,560
to the couple of questions that were

996
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,440
asked about um i think procedure-wise

997
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,680
i'd like to address those and then uh

998
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,960
greg if you want to get back to

999
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,200
technical that would be good afterwards

1000
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,000
um

1001
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,720
so we have we do have the joint uh

1002
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,880
group we are coordinating with them this

1003
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,560
was presented there

1004
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,440
uh

1005
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,520
so that that's happening

1006
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,560
uh and that needs to continue to happen

1007
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,119
in terms of the documents and what we do

1008
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,720
in this working group

1009
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,480
i think it is worthwhile

1010
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,480
for us to document what we believe is

1011
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,280
the working group position and then make

1012
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,119
sure we synchronize it right now all we

1013
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,040
have is an individual proposal that that

1014
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,640
doesn't carry the same weight as this is

1015
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,000
the direction that working group would

1016
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,280
like to go

1017
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,520
so if this is in fact

1018
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,440
you know blind document does in fact

1019
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,800
represent the direction the working

1020
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,720
group like would like to go i think we

1021
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,079
should bring it into the working group

1022
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,359
document

1023
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,440
and continue to socialize it and as the

1024
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,200
work progresses uh if it if it gets uh

1025
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,800
it could end up getting moved into a

1026
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
pals document it could get moved into a

1027
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,640
joint document and then we work with the

1028
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,960
chairs to figure out where it is

1029
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,160
but

1030
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,000
you know we'd like to keep the process

1031
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,839
going at the same time

1032
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,640
we're um

1033
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,720
you know coordinating so

1034
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,640
being able to represent whether or not

1035
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,800
this is a working group position or an

1036
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,240
individual position i think is an

1037
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,959
important step

1038
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,200
although i think it would be useful to

1039
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,000
get some earlier feedback than that so

1040
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,680
that no one is surprised and there is no

1041
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,000
and and any corrections can be adopted

1042
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,119
earlier i can't see anything wrong with

1043
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,880
this but i just think it would be really

1044
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,200
useful to have that discussion sooner

1045
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,800
rather than later and i don't think it

1046
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,200
would be 100 but it was presented in the

1047
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,560
joint meeting is that not sufficient

1048
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,520
i must have been asleep i was taking

1049
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,040
copious notes during that meeting and i

1050
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,800
don't remember it but still i must have

1051
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,640
been asleep and once i'm losing

1052
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,760
i mean it's

1053
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,880
one of us has lost whatever is lost i

1054
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,240
thought this was presented in the joint

1055
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,000
meeting maybe i'm wrong

1056
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,680
yeah i was

1057
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,319
i was i presented this uh

1058
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,760
part of

1059
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,359
their

1060
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,800
talking so i joined janus and uh

1061
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,599
as a buffer of nuclear build craft and i

1062
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,720
presented uh their uh

1063
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,640
definite hph uh four minutes

1064
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,560
and some uh

1065
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,000
one of uh good comments

1066
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,440
somehow rather it went below the radar

1067
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,880
but um

1068
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,640
um anyway i think they're probably more

1069
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,400
or less in sync anyway

1070
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,440
yeah but

1071
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,599
your general point is correct and i and

1072
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,920
i completely support it which is

1073
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,480
independent uh well in parallel with

1074
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,000
what we do in this working group and

1075
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,520
what we decide in this working group we

1076
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,960
must uh socialize coordinate with the

1077
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,920
joint

1078
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,800
uh activity that joint design team the

1079
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,920
and uh and we may we should be aware

1080
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,160
that anything we do here it could be

1081
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,640
affected by that for example what we

1082
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,680
agree may be modified based on the the

1083
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,880
joint agreement between the working

1084
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,480
groups and in fact we may take the

1085
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,640
format out eventually and run it through

1086
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,400
the pals working group if that's the end

1087
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,359
decision

1088
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,839
um but you know having agreement of this

1089
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,280
working group

1090
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,680
i think is an important step you've seen

1091
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,240
mpls making you know doing the same

1092
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,240
thing of of putting together positions

1093
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,000
that are right for the mpls working

1094
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,760
group and then we'll we'll coordinate

1095
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,200
between the working groups cross working

1096
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,319
groups uh

1097
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,440
uh to get make sure we have a uh

1098
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,400
an answer that works for all

1099
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,680
at least that's how i'm seeing the

1100
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,280
process i should mention janos is being

1101
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,880
quite because he's a co-author

1102
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,319
on the work

1103
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,560
so my only concern is that someone in

1104
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,560
pals will remember something or other

1105
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,480
that that breaks as a result of this i

1106
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,560
can't think of anything

1107
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,400
yeah that's

1108
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,319
needs to weigh in on this i agree with

1109
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:45,760
you a hundred percent thousands of

1110
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,040
million

1111
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,520
and maybe the right thing is is if we

1112
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,560
that net

1113
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,480
uh end up last calling the document we

1114
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,280
do a joint last call

1115
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,560
okay greg you had a comment and we

1116
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,880
should uh try to wrap up because yes

1117
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,960
it's usually important we are running

1118
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,000
over

1119
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,920
brief technical comment um so um

1120
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,720
we believe i believe that um

1121
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,680
uh this is important and um so i would

1122
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,440
appreciate the working group uh

1123
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,280
discussion on the mailing list and uh

1124
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,599
derived conclusion

1125
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,559
uh in regard to um updating their

1126
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,280
working group document and uh inc

1127
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,040
with their new um

1128
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,400
that net ach format uh their uh

1129
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,280
interaction to the work of open design

1130
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,640
team uh one of their documents that uh

1131
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,160
working as now its individual document

1132
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,480
of group of uh contributors on finally

1133
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,680
creating um their registry for the first

1134
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,079
nibble after mpls stack

1135
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,839
and uh value uh zero for the first uh

1136
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,160
value one for the first nibble is

1137
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,359
reserved for uh pseudo-wire

1138
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,839
ach and now it's

1139
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,640
to the wire that net ach

1140
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,079
and uh

1141
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,520
based on uh direction from mpls working

1142
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,640
group or direction of open design team

1143
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,559
is uh that any new mechanism should not

1144
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,240
uh

1145
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,400
impede on existing functionality and uh

1146
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,599
it can be used as it can be used is it

1147
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,960
used uh currently so uh to minimize

1148
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,280
interaction so probably that means that

1149
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,200
it will use a different

1150
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,920
uh first nibble

1151
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,040
value for its header post stack

1152
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,200
so with that i can close this

1153
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,040
presentation and

1154
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,960
let's move the discussion to the mailing

1155
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,200
list

1156
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,319
greg as author in fact we'll just call

1157
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,319
you editor you can change yourself to

1158
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:01,119
editor of the document but as uh editor

1159
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,520
of the working group document um would

1160
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,160
you conduct a poll on the list to see if

1161
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,000
there's objections to bringing in the

1162
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,960
technical content of bellagio's document

1163
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,960
into the working group document

1164
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,599
that's very good idea thank you lou and

1165
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,640
i'll shoot an email to the working group

1166
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,160
with that question

1167
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,640
great thank you

1168
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:38,240
okay so this slide drag is about how to

1169
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,119
provide pre-off for the net ip data

1170
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,079
plane

1171
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,839
and i'm presenting it uh uh

1172
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,920
from the code or sienna fergus and

1173
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,280
andrew mills

1174
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,079
next slide please

1175
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,200
uh so uh this document is focusing on

1176
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,400
how to add the po functionality to the

1177
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,599
that net ipp ip data plane uh it is

1178
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,920
listing the requirements

1179
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,839
for adding pre-off

1180
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,839
and it is also providing

1181
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:14,000
details how we can do that

1182
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,480
there are solution basics described

1183
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,960
encapsulation are also described in the

1184
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,280
document there is a detailed pocket

1185
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,119
processing

1186
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,680
it is also dealing with the flow

1187
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,359
aggregation topic

1188
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,760
uh and the defines in detail of the the

1189
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,160
pre-op procedures

1190
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,559
uh next slide please

1191
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,599
we are currently at version uh

1192
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,520
or one

1193
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,040
and there were

1194
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,079
these updates in the document it is

1195
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,920
quite stable so there were some

1196
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,319
editorial updates typos some grammar

1197
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:49,920
were corrected

1198
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,319
and we have received comments on the

1199
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,960
list in order to clarify

1200
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,160
that this solution is based on uh on

1201
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,559
tunneling techniques so this is what was

1202
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,200
explicitly added to the document

1203
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,079
the solution creates a set of underlay

1204
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,520
uh udpip tunnels between an overlay set

1205
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,920
of that net relay nodes

1206
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,920
uh the text of the document is quite

1207
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,319
stable uh so next slide please

1208
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:22,319
uh so just to summarize uh this draft is

1209
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:23,200
really

1210
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,599
leveraging the existing data data plane

1211
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,000
building blocks there are no new header

1212
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,400
fields specified this is a general

1213
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,480
solution verbs both for ipv4 and ipv6

1214
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,880
and and pre-op defined

1215
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,720
for the dotnet service sub-layer

1216
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,119
the solution uh is

1217
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,839
applicable irrespective what routing

1218
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,680
techniques is used

1219
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,079
underneath the detonate service sub

1220
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,680
layer

1221
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,920
so any ip rooting techniques can be

1222
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,280
applied

1223
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,520
and last but not least it does not

1224
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,760
require any additional processing on

1225
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,079
transit nodes

1226
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,640
the document is quite stable so we are

1227
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,839
asking for very loop adoption on on this

1228
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:08,800
draft

1229
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,200
thank you

1230
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,960
torrelis please go ahead

1231
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,359
so um i think we're stuck in the

1232
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,599
discussion about the point i raised we

1233
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,119
went back and forth and i think it would

1234
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,119
be good to have an audio discussion

1235
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,319
about that not necessarily here um in in

1236
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,880
the meeting but let's find some time

1237
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,160
afterwards because i don't uh think that

1238
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,040
i saw a you know satisfactory answer to

1239
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,240
the

1240
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,079
problem i raised with respect to the

1241
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,040
need to consider how

1242
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,720
the

1243
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,520
elimination function and

1244
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,680
the

1245
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:57,119
jitter or buffering that it

1246
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,640
necessarily creates can be integrated

1247
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,040
into any of the possible

1248
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,559
bounded latency uh calculi that we may

1249
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,200
use in a way that it doesn't mess up the

1250
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,480
calculations for um you know whatever

1251
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,880
shaping queuing or other processing is

1252
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,880
done for the bounded latency

1253
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,480
you were giving some explanations but i

1254
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,559
i couldn't make heads or tail a lot of

1255
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,800
them

1256
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,040
tell us my my understanding is that your

1257
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,800
comment was regarding the pocket

1258
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,119
ordering functionality draft and not

1259
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,240
regarding this draft

1260
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,640
no no was the the packet elimination

1261
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,040
function

1262
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,839
the elimination function which basically

1263
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:46,960
um you know creates the jitter when the

1264
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,920
primary uh flow uh you know let's say

1265
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,480
you have the a and b flow um

1266
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,559
a has the shorter latency b has the

1267
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,599
longer latency um and obviously um you

1268
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,160
know if all the flows from a come then

1269
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,920
the elimination function doesn't really

1270
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,160
do anything right it just drops all the

1271
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,800
one from b but as soon as something in a

1272
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,920
uh is missing you need to forward the

1273
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,839
the same packet from b and obviously

1274
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:14,240
there is a lot of um you know jitter

1275
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,480
between a and b and kind of the

1276
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,880
differential path latency and taking

1277
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,319
that into account in a way that um we

1278
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,440
can simply drop the elimination function

1279
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,920
into the forwarding chain uh and don't

1280
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,480
mess up the calculus for the bounded

1281
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,800
latency of the queuing in before or

1282
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,720
after the the pre-op i think that that

1283
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,359
needs to be worked well through and it

1284
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,640
might actually you know uh require to

1285
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,200
have uh some you know buffering function

1286
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,520
in there to avoid pushing off the

1287
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,480
increased jitter into the poor calculus

1288
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,599
of

1289
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,880
the bounded latency shaping yeah

1290
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,599
um this is a clarification question what

1291
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,079
does that have to do with this document

1292
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,000
as opposed to am i confused here um

1293
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,359
because i

1294
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:02,720
thought

1295
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,720
isn't it isn't your comment just a

1296
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,960
general statement on pre-off

1297
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,280
as opposed to pre-op and ip i mean this

1298
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,440
document scope is oh oh sorry then then

1299
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,160
then i may have made uh that uh comment

1300
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,319
on the on the wrong document here i i

1301
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:17,920
don't think we actually have an active

1302
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,040
document

1303
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,520
that's your comment um they based on oh

1304
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,000
yeah no this is no i was talking about

1305
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,880
a

1306
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,559
personal document

1307
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:27,599
yeah so

1308
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,520
so is this but this is bringing in

1309
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,119
pre-op mechanisms that exist in mpls

1310
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,799
into ip

1311
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,559
and i think you're talking about the

1312
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:40,960
base mpls ish base pre-off in mpls

1313
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,880
and now wait a second so

1314
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,280
it applies to you know it's generally

1315
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,559
i'm not saying your comment's wrong i'm

1316
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,000
saying the comment is generally

1317
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,240
applicable to

1318
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,799
you know an rfc that we have

1319
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,880
and to any data plane

1320
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,160
yeah not only the uh

1321
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,480
[Music]

1322
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,640
comment i think it's a valid comment i

1323
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,400
don't think it's a valid comment

1324
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,240
on this document because

1325
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,799
this document is just taking a mechanism

1326
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,079
that we already have defined and

1327
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,319
applying it in a different data plane

1328
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,079
so i think your comment is a good one

1329
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:14,799
and perhaps warrants its own separate

1330
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:17,200
discussion

1331
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,640
given that we have an rfc on it

1332
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,599
no i yeah i think it's the right

1333
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,720
document i think the uh yeah the

1334
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,960
you're right that that

1335
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,680
this is not specific of course to the

1336
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,640
you know

1337
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,359
um just

1338
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:36,880
yeah yeah

1339
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,839
to to the it is not specific only to ip

1340
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,040
i'm going to

1341
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,720
pull my uh joker card that it's a 4 56

1342
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,440
a.m in the morning sorry

1343
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,680
perfect perfectly fine i think this is a

1344
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,440
great discussion i would suggest that if

1345
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,440
you run independent of this document

1346
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,319
because it's a general point

1347
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,919
that's stuart

1348
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:06,160
sorry so i am a bit confused as to why

1349
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,839
we need to write this document so we

1350
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,880
have

1351
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,799
um

1352
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:13,799
mpls

1353
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,160
written and that includes prayoff and we

1354
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,359
have a document that says how you carry

1355
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,480
that

1356
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,040
over udpip

1357
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,160
so

1358
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,760
do we miss something somewhere i mean i

1359
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,839
don't understand why inheritance doesn't

1360
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,440
mean that this just works and there's

1361
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,280
nothing to write but maybe i've missed

1362
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,599
something

1363
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:38,880
stuart i i think here the main intention

1364
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,839
was to to make it clear and obvious how

1365
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,558
it can be done

1366
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,960
so so i mean i would have thought that

1367
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,559
all wasn't the all that we needed to do

1368
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:49,359
then

1369
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:50,160
it

1370
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,680
sounds like maybe it's not obvious from

1371
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,200
the original documents is to write a

1372
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,359
one-line update to the udp document that

1373
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:00,160
says by the way you can do pre-os

1374
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,280
because

1375
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,440
surely everything just follows and we

1376
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,079
don't normally sort of micro document

1377
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:08,559
things that are already inherited

1378
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:12,000
in the in our existing stacks

1379
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,680
i think we've um

1380
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,880
gotten

1381
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,760
uh

1382
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,599
a little bit better about helping people

1383
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:19,520
understand how to use the technology as

1384
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,440
building blocks so an informational

1385
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,359
document that says how to combine things

1386
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,280
you know has we've done those in other

1387
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,440
groups so i don't think it's off

1388
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,400
completely out of scope

1389
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,520
maybe one more thing to add is that the

1390
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,040
dotnet ip data plane document claim no

1391
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,799
pre-op for ip

1392
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,599
explicitly

1393
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,760
pre-offer ip

1394
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,640
but

1395
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,040
there is pre-offer mpls

1396
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,440
and that's what it was carrying now so

1397
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,640
maybe you need to write a document but

1398
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,839
it doesn't i don't think it really needs

1399
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:53,680
to be more than one line to say by the

1400
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,359
way you might not realize you can do

1401
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:59,200
this go and read these other documents

1402
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,400
uh

1403
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,920
even though the queue is closed we'll go

1404
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,839
to pascal and david we're way over time

1405
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:05,280
we're gonna just so as a heads up to

1406
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,880
other presenters we're going to end up

1407
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,400
squeezing your time a little bit

1408
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,079
reducing your time pascal you're up

1409
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:12,799
yeah

1410
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,960
so i'll try to be quick so we're talking

1411
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,200
about encapsulation and as we talk about

1412
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,000
encapsulation we and for ip right we

1413
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,960
basically uh lose the the visibility of

1414
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,880
the inner flow unless we have to dig

1415
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,559
deep in the packet

1416
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,640
so we end up in the discussion similar

1417
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,960
to the one we just had at raw which is

1418
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,200
basically how

1419
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,599
what basic what identifies

1420
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:38,400
a copy of the packet

1421
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,359
um you know the sequence number and and

1422
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:44,000
the flow id or something uh is is

1423
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,480
typically what we comes to mind

1424
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,880
in that row we kind of make a difference

1425
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,359
between the flow identification as being

1426
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:53,119
the upper layer

1427
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:56,640
udp thing versus what goes in ip

1428
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,880
and if you if you take that path it

1429
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,799
means that you need to have ipad ip

1430
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:02,480
information in the ipad there is an

1431
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,119
accentuators and here we are saying hey

1432
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:07,040
we are tunneling and still we don't

1433
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,880
change anything we don't add anything to

1434
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,599
the to the others and so

1435
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,200
question comes to mind how do you find

1436
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,720
the flow how do you find the sequence

1437
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,720
counter i mean all this is needed

1438
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,040
so first of all sequence counters are

1439
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,680
needed only on the relay nodes and on

1440
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,440
the that not really you know

1441
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,760
into the list um just because we're way

1442
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,960
over yeah

1443
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,160
yeah okay so basically by my bottom line

1444
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,440
let's take it to the list i agree my

1445
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,040
bottom line is there are different

1446
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,960
documents which talk about the data plan

1447
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,960
for ip we need to reconcile this as

1448
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,960
opposed to just adopt one we need to

1449
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,799
understand why this what those different

1450
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:45,200
documents are saying and how that that

1451
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,200
needs to be combined or what

1452
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,720
right so pascal you're saying it's an

1453
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,640
implementation guidance document this is

1454
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,160
useful and so you're countering

1455
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,960
stewart's point correct

1456
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,880
not not uh i'm saying it's probably not

1457
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,200
sufficient uh we if we if we really want

1458
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,880
to do something in the ap later plane we

1459
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,880
probably need more than just a tunnel i

1460
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,640
think just a tunnel may lose that

1461
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,960
information we care about or it's never

1462
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,559
been there like secrets

1463
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,319
yeah i think so you're actually making a

1464
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,920
different point and i think that's valid

1465
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,319
is we should leave room for true ip

1466
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,400
solutions in the future all right david

1467
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,599
please go ahead

1468
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:21,839
last time

1469
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:24,559
if one is prepared to run the

1470
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:28,400
mpls or udpr or ip uh data plane end to

1471
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,000
end and i think stewart's comment is

1472
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,760
correct that uh there really isn't much

1473
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,280
to say however if one wants to imply

1474
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:37,359
encapsulation over only part of the path

1475
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:38,960
so that we're going to pre-off over part

1476
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,720
of the path without running that whole

1477
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,720
data plane end-to-end then there's some

1478
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,240
interesting stuff to done i think

1479
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,400
pascal's been busy uh been been

1480
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,319
helpfully exploring some of it

1481
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:51,640
in his comments

1482
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,599
okay thank you

1483
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:57,920
uh look forward to a good discussion on

1484
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,640
the list on this um clearly there's

1485
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,920
interest and uh disagreement so uh

1486
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,160
should foster some good discussion uh

1487
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:06,960
the

1488
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:07,760
uh

1489
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,920
bellage you're up next uh you originally

1490
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,520
scheduled for 10 minutes gonna cut you

1491
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,720
down to five please i i will do my best

1492
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,680
yeah

1493
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,240
okay so this is about pocket ordering

1494
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,280
function and uh i have quote or stefan

1495
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,839
kerres tobias tobias here and janos

1496
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:27,359
farkas next slide please

1497
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:33,119
so this draft is version 2

1498
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,000
and it is dealing with the situation

1499
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,839
that replication and elimination

1500
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:40,319
functions may result in out of order

1501
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:41,920
packets

1502
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,760
and this is what the packet ordering

1503
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,440
function uh

1504
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,039
algorithms can correct and restore

1505
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,799
the original packet order

1506
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:55,920
next slide please

1507
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,640
so

1508
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,319
the document is

1509
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:04,319
is quite stable uh we have uh added some

1510
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:06,880
made some editorial updates uh since the

1511
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,319
last version

1512
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:09,200
uh

1513
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,240
there were discussion uh on the list uh

1514
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,280
and it is also related that orless uh

1515
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,760
commented in the previous

1516
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,640
slot

1517
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,480
so we have made it

1518
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,000
clear

1519
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,200
that

1520
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,200
packet ordering function

1521
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,240
may cause delay variation however how to

1522
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,640
eliminate this delay variation this is

1523
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,160
out of scope in this document

1524
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,200
and

1525
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,119
dealing with the delay variation is a

1526
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,599
net forwarding sub layer target and it

1527
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,839
can be achieved for example by placing a

1528
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:44,400
digital buffer or a flow regulator like

1529
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,240
a shaping function after the probe

1530
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,000
functionality

1531
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,440
so this is definitely word for

1532
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,680
discussion but this is something that is

1533
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,520
out of scope in this document because

1534
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,079
this document is focusing on what

1535
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:59,119
algorithms you can use in order to

1536
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:00,240
achieve

1537
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,839
the pocket ordering functions

1538
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,319
and we have also updated the security

1539
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:08,960
consideration part of the document

1540
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,000
referring to the security document and

1541
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,160
highlighting that these algorithms does

1542
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,799
not imply new security concerns

1543
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:18,880
regarding the post

1544
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,400
next slide

1545
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,799
please

1546
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:26,319
so we have the discussion on the list we

1547
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:29,200
have made some proposed changes updates

1548
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,599
uh we feel that regarding the prof

1549
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:34,079
algorithms how it is working this is

1550
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,920
something pretty stable

1551
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,160
we have received good comments for the

1552
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,640
previous version and and updated the

1553
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,880
draft according to that

1554
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,280
so here again the next step is planned

1555
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,559
to ask for very loop adoption

1556
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:52,079
thank you uh dollas

1557
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,400
we we can't take

1558
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,400
the problem of um

1559
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,720
being able to define um

1560
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,839
the latency calculus for um the pre-op

1561
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:04,160
function out of scope of when we're

1562
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,240
defining the prior function right just

1563
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,160
hand waving and saving this forwarding

1564
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,760
plane function so i think we should

1565
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,720
discuss that so because this was always

1566
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,319
the problem with with with the bounded

1567
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,240
latency that we need to have a linear

1568
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,319
model you know that every component

1569
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,319
we're adding to the path you know can be

1570
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:22,880
calculated by itself and you know not

1571
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,200
pushing off some unknown uh latency

1572
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,319
variation um to to to some undefined

1573
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,640
step

1574
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,720
yeah i i think this is why we have

1575
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,599
separated the sub layers we have defined

1576
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,839
the service sub layer dealing with

1577
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:40,640
protection and we have defined the

1578
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,720
forwarding sub layer

1579
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,119
dealing with the latency and

1580
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,760
jitter-related

1581
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,359
issues regarding that net flows

1582
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,200
no but i mean the the point is about

1583
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,599
pushing pushing from

1584
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:57,520
this document this function this

1585
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,559
component some undefined uh you know

1586
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,440
later engines data off to something else

1587
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,680
is architecturally not the correct thing

1588
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,640
this is this is basically a you know a

1589
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,400
latency that needs to be possible to

1590
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,960
calculate for this function and then

1591
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,799
there is really the question does it

1592
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:17,760
make sense then to push off um

1593
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,559
the

1594
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,720
the problem of how to fix these things

1595
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,559
so that it becomes linear again to some

1596
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,640
other component

1597
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,480
yeah but we're running out

1598
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,000
i sent you an email let's let's find

1599
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,839
some time to discuss this more please

1600
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:33,920
okay um i i think it would be very good

1601
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,400
to get a informational document that

1602
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,240
talks about how implementation should

1603
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,160
manage that issue tourists i don't know

1604
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,839
if you want to contribute that or work

1605
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:44,319
with balaj to to do that and whether

1606
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:45,760
it's this document or a separate

1607
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,480
document um you know that would be i

1608
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,720
think really help the working group

1609
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,039
it's a good issue you're bringing up uh

1610
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:55,200
that implementations need to consider i

1611
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,640
don't think we're talking about changing

1612
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,119
any of the data plane uh behaviors it's

1613
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:02,240
really just the the calculus that the

1614
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,680
essentially the controllers have to do

1615
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,079
so it's it's a good implementation

1616
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,440
uh uh guidance document so that would be

1617
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,200
really nice

1618
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,599
worst case my contention is that we

1619
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,280
should consider that

1620
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,680
the elimination ordering function need

1621
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,160
to have a shaper um per flow in it like

1622
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,079
you know the uh

1623
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:22,960
the

1624
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,880
like the shapers we have associated with

1625
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,680
the queues and ats for example right the

1626
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,760
the cues are what we do on the interface

1627
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,760
and then we have the shaper for them and

1628
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,440
likewise the same shaper could be

1629
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,680
required you know for the elimination

1630
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,920
ordering function and that would be part

1631
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,280
of the elimination and ordering

1632
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,200
architectural component so that's the

1633
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,839
worst case

1634
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:46,559
look forward to reading the document

1635
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,720
thanks

1636
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,959
thank you

1637
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,160
uh please proceed you have ten minutes

1638
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,119
uh yeah okay um hello this is pony from

1639
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,960
channel mobile and it's my pleasure to

1640
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,039
talk about the requirements of large

1641
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:15,440
scale deterministic network next slides

1642
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,760
please

1643
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:25,439
okay here is the motivations uh in the

1644
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:27,600
last entry meeting which may talk about

1645
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,279
if more queuing mechanisms should be

1646
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,439
considered the requirements were

1647
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:34,319
presented and would like to work in the

1648
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,040
requirement draft first so we submit the

1649
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,198
new draft and hopefully it can be used

1650
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,040
as the standpoint

1651
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,719
compared with the plantation at the

1652
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,520
entry meeting the new draft has more uh

1653
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,359
analysis about the

1654
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,839
large-scale domestic network influence

1655
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:50,880
the

1656
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,040
queuing mechanism and based on which we

1657
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:56,080
put up some new requirements

1658
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:59,359
and next slides please

1659
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:04,640
so let's have a recap on the

1660
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,799
different levels of application

1661
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:09,120
requirements and obviously of use case

1662
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,520
gave the requirements of industrial uh

1663
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,439
electricity buildings and so on some of

1664
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:14,560
them

1665
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,040
clearly specified the requirement for

1666
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,359
lateness let's say a jitter and well

1667
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:22,319
some not for the so far when providing

1668
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:25,040
uh deterministic network service network

1669
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,960
network providers always face the

1670
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,960
problem of how to

1671
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,040
match application demands to the

1672
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,839
technology

1673
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:36,719
um um so um the

1674
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:40,799
service can be um clarified one is uh

1675
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:43,359
uh one kind has critical as is

1676
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:46,560
such as remote control or cloud plc or

1677
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,120
manufacturing and differential

1678
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,759
protection of electricity and there are

1679
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:54,719
also some relatively lower levels of srv

1680
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:56,719
for consumer networks such as cloud

1681
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:59,120
gaming cloud vr

1682
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,440
the user of these applications hope to

1683
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,080
have a better network experience but

1684
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,640
they can tolerate it to a certain extent

1685
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,480
if the network quality is not so good

1686
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,080
sometimes

1687
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,159
moreover uh such users are willing to

1688
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:14,400
spend more money for high quality

1689
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,960
network service and they need some

1690
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,040
aspects because they have no industry

1691
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,360
barriers and can tolerate exceeding the

1692
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,480
upper

1693
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,080
boundary of latency within small

1694
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,520
probability

1695
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,280
they have relatively

1696
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,280
lower requirements for the network and

1697
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:34,000
may be easier to deploy an excise please

1698
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,440
and here are some

1699
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,520
deployment and application status of

1700
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,640
literary

1701
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,880
deterministic network

1702
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,840
so we won't

1703
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:50,719
give some much explanation about it um

1704
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:53,280
just want to show that um

1705
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,800
[Music]

1706
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,440
this draws on both operators and

1707
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,760
enterprise users begin to put forward

1708
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,520
deterministic requirements for the

1709
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,280
large-scale networks

1710
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,880
but the

1711
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,040
used technologies are not exactly the

1712
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:10,080
same so you can see more work is needed

1713
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,159
for network service providers to

1714
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:14,719
successfully sell that net type service

1715
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:16,560
to customers

1716
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,760
okay next science please

1717
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,960
this is a requirement to a list

1718
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,960
according to the

1719
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,080
uh

1720
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,480
differential um

1721
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,719
application requirements um

1722
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:35,920
including the tolerance time uh

1723
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,080
synchrony and supports the large signal

1724
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,719
hope propagation latency accommodates

1725
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:41,920
the higher

1726
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,560
link speed this giveaway tolerates

1727
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:47,440
failures of links and all nodes and

1728
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,600
wg chain changes

1729
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,920
and the support incremental device

1730
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,120
updates

1731
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,840
next slides please

1732
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,800
quantum one is to tolerate time a

1733
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,760
synchrony including four situations

1734
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,080
first is to support

1735
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,199
asynchronous clocks across domains and

1736
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:12,640
one of dennis objects is to stitch tests

1737
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,159
and islands together which may have

1738
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:15,760
different clocks and

1739
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,640
are not synchronized so the mechanism

1740
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,719
should be able to support the

1741
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:23,199
interaction across time domains the

1742
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:25,679
second is storage data and wonder within

1743
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,679
clock synchronized

1744
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:28,800
domain

1745
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,560
within a

1746
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,640
single time synchronization the main

1747
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:33,840
different

1748
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:37,840
clock accuracy is expected

1749
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:40,239
the large-scale network should be able

1750
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:42,640
to recover or observe

1751
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,280
such time variance within a domain and

1752
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,840
across multi-domains

1753
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,000
third is to provide mechanism not

1754
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,679
requiring phone full-time

1755
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:53,679
synchronization

1756
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:55,840
it is really hard to achieve the full

1757
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,760
time synchronization in

1758
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,520
large scale networks when considering

1759
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,320
the diameter of network topology and it

1760
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,640
is designed that the same performance

1761
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,640
in terms of the boundaries and the data

1762
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,159
can be achieved

1763
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:10,560
when full-time synchronization is not

1764
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,000
used

1765
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
such as the frequency

1766
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,840
synchronization used in the two

1767
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:20,040
trials and the last one is to support a

1768
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,679
synchronization-based

1769
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:22,640
master

1770
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,960
method due to the large amount of

1771
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,520
traffic in large uh secured network and

1772
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,800
some of them are a cyclic and and not

1773
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,760
all the networks or device support

1774
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,199
synchronizations

1775
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:37,360
such as ats um

1776
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,880
use perform based synchron uh

1777
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,800
nervous shipper to

1778
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,520
achieve boundary latency and the formula

1779
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,960
proof shows it

1780
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,719
effectiveness

1781
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:51,520
next size please

1782
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,440
um quantum 2 is to

1783
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,520
support the large single hoop

1784
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,159
propagation latency the distance of

1785
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:02,400
transmission transmission transmission

1786
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,040
is long enough to generate a larger

1787
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,120
latency that line for

1788
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,600
cyclic based method the

1789
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,440
length of

1790
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,320
cycle must be either set long enough

1791
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,719
into buffer case or other mechanism

1792
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,239
should be provided

1793
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,560
and come through is to

1794
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:24,719
accommodate the higher link speed

1795
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,679
the large-scale network normally use

1796
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:30,400
higher link speed especially for its

1797
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,040
backbone and with increasing of the date

1798
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,960
rate the scheduling

1799
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,360
cycle can be reduced which requires a

1800
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,840
more precise time control and if the

1801
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,960
network cycle times remains the same

1802
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,719
more data constant

1803
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:47,600
which requires more buffer space which

1804
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,040
impose more

1805
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,280
complex buffer or

1806
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,960
qmag management and larger memory

1807
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:59,120
consumption next size please

1808
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,980
the requirement for is to be scalable

1809
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:03,280
[Music]

1810
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,320
it's inc

1811
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,400
include two aspects

1812
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,040
the increase or decrease of the network

1813
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:12,480
device influence topology and discovery

1814
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,760
mechanisms

1815
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,760
for example the ultra low latency of

1816
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,080
application spot network would require

1817
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,239
the net extent to

1818
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:22,159
every 5g base station which might be

1819
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:25,760
hundreds of thousands for one operator

1820
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,560
and for the massive traffic flows it is

1821
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:31,199
almost impossible to identify individual

1822
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,920
rb flow at the net plan because the

1823
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,560
larger overhead and resource reservation

1824
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,080
for massive number of flows so

1825
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,960
flow correlation is required individual

1826
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,040
flow may join and exist

1827
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,239
the aggregated flow rate rapidly

1828
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:50,400
which will cause dynamic in

1829
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:54,400
identification of aggregate than netflow

1830
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,199
and requirement five is to tolerate

1831
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:59,360
failures of links or nodes and tableau

1832
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,440
changes

1833
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,600
network link failures are more common in

1834
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,440
large sql networks

1835
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,920
but switching or re-convergence of

1836
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,560
routing will cause high length of packet

1837
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,199
loss and retransmission which is usually

1838
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:15,120
in seconds before the network is stable

1839
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:15,920
again

1840
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,480
and it is necessary to support a certain

1841
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:21,840
mechanism to adapt to figures

1842
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:22,719
of

1843
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:26,640
links or nodes and topology changes

1844
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,520
next slides please

1845
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,840
requirement 6 is to support incremental

1846
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,480
device updates since some applications

1847
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:40,000
that require relatively low level of sle

1848
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,239
it will bring acceptable for those

1849
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:44,480
applications to tolerate a

1850
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,159
deterministic low

1851
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:49,600
probability to exceed the upper

1852
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,679
boundary of latency for those

1853
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,520
applications some simple solutions that

1854
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,480
may

1855
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,280
be realized by update and configure the

1856
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,920
ingress and egress device or part of

1857
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,000
network service

1858
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,960
network device are expected meanwhile

1859
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,280
they're critical as if some applications

1860
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,760
can be achieved by adding the existing

1861
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,360
or other new

1862
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,960
mechanisms and updating more service

1863
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,000
okay next guys please

1864
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,679
and here are some proposed q magazine

1865
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:25,040
besides test and insert

1866
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:29,199
service they are not included in the

1867
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:31,040
boundary latency draft

1868
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,000
which is

1869
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,760
will be published

1870
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:34,640
soon

1871
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,040
we list them and also give some analysis

1872
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,199
about the levels of deterministic

1873
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,760
uh synchronization or notes the cost

1874
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,560
stability and the flow aggregation

1875
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,280
the first one is based on as a frequency

1876
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,360
synchronization and multiple thick like

1877
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,840
cyclic buffers that can be proved to

1878
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,280
provide the boundary listening and the

1879
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:56,400
jitter it is used the flow aggregation

1880
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,719
and the scalability is also good

1881
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:01,520
um and the second um

1882
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,159
uh is micro robust decreasing uh since

1883
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:05,280
it's

1884
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,679
interrupted but given the time i think

1885
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,560
it's important too um the okay

1886
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,400
requirements are really good

1887
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,440
but you don't have to discuss the

1888
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,760
alternatives out there or do a gap

1889
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,400
analysis to do the requirements and

1890
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,600
this is going to cause a lot of

1891
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,360
discussion and argument

1892
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,360
and it really is separate from your

1893
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,840
point about uh requirements so i think

1894
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,040
adding this having this in the

1895
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,679
presentation and the document is uh

1896
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,880
actually diminishes from the document

1897
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,800
so it may be best to remove it and have

1898
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,320
it in a separate document so we can

1899
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,640
focus on the requirements if that's okay

1900
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,719
and an interesting time to go to your

1901
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,800
next slide

1902
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:45,840
okay

1903
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,040
thank you

1904
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,360
thank you

1905
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,719
um okay um

1906
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:54,800
next steps uh

1907
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,640
wait wait wait more

1908
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,080
analysis and discussion about the

1909
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,159
requirements i will come and people who

1910
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:01,679
are interested in this work please

1911
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:07,000
contact contact me yeah and any comments

1912
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,360
the question uh in terms of the

1913
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:14,080
relationship of this document

1914
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,080
uh compared to the one you presented at

1915
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,800
the interim

1916
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:21,280
[Music]

1917
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,640
with which

1918
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,239
so what's the relationship between the

1919
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:26,159
two documents because it's a zero zero

1920
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:28,799
document

1921
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,718
uh

1922
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:36,560
yeah um i think this uh question may be

1923
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:40,719
discussed later after this presentation

1924
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:48,080
we we can take it to the left and i mean

1925
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,159
the question was to you like is it a

1926
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:51,679
replacement

1927
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:53,760
and so on because in the interim the

1928
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,600
takeaway was to develop the requirements

1929
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:59,040
further i got that but uh

1930
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:00,719
yano

1931
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:04,159
let me take it to the list

1932
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:06,719
yeah okay

1933
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,920
uh is the person in queue

1934
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,920
uh

1935
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,040
actually i

1936
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,840
answer janos question so it's a quick

1937
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:16,639
answer

1938
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:19,360
very quickly yeah because i'm i'm one of

1939
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,159
the courses of this of just now the zero

1940
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:24,320
zero version and the one

1941
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,560
presented in the interim actually there

1942
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,679
was no

1943
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:30,159
mature um draft

1944
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:34,000
so basically the draft presented just

1945
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,040
now is the very first version of that

1946
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,760
so that's that's a quick answer for that

1947
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,840
what's what's being presented in the

1948
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,840
interim actually is a basically a

1949
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,960
collection of the information it's slide

1950
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,280
it's ppt slide space but there is no

1951
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,600
mature draft based on that

1952
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,360
that was i mean

1953
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,599
yeah

1954
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,480
let's take more discussion on this topic

1955
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:04,400
to the list and um

1956
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,199
then the requirements related to the

1957
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:15,280
queen mechanisms

1958
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:18,000
and do you consider other

1959
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,320
skill networks such as

1960
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,840
reducing a macro burst and enhancing

1961
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:28,600
their results and their roots

1962
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:48,719
i i did not hear you yeah so so uh my

1963
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:50,000
suggestion would be if you have

1964
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,840
questions comments to the previous

1965
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,600
presentation then please take it to the

1966
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,760
list and let's get started with this

1967
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:59,199
presentation because we are over time

1968
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:01,520
yes you have eight minutes thank you

1969
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,560
start

1970
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:05,440
giving your presentation okay

1971
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,880
okay okay

1972
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,560
and so uh this draft is also about the

1973
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,199
requirements for the wide aerial ip

1974
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:16,320
domestic networking

1975
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,560
i do hear me

1976
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:21,280
your slides are already shared can you

1977
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:25,239
start talking to them

1978
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,560
i i i could hear you fine in previously

1979
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:31,840
but uh

1980
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,000
yeah she may be having a problem please

1981
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,600
please uh please proceed with the

1982
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,280
president

1983
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:40,560
yes please proceed yes please proceed

1984
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,880
okay sorry

1985
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,239
unless slide please

1986
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:52,120
is it only me who doesn't hear her

1987
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:55,280
i i see indications that he is speaking

1988
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,000
i

1989
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,239
first

1990
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,320
i can hear her

1991
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:07,840
okay i will proceed first uh

1992
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,400
we discussed about the possible problems

1993
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,880
with the wide arrow ip deterministical

1994
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,000
networking

1995
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,440
uh we divided it into two parts of the

1996
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:18,560
work

1997
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,320
they are deterministically networking

1998
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,440
and wide area network for this mystery

1999
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,400
network we should consider two issues

2000
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:29,199
first different services requires

2001
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:31,840
different shaded satellite cues for

2002
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,120
example

2003
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:37,120
400 microseconds delay is required for

2004
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:41,440
audio and video but no more than 100 100

2005
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,960
micro seconds

2006
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,440
delay should be guaranteed by

2007
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,679
industrial application

2008
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:50,960
second problems with resource location

2009
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,840
rules should be taken into account

2010
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,440
account

2011
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:58,159
for example resource should be located

2012
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:00,320
for the deadline

2013
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,639
but it will lead to low efficiency

2014
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:06,080
efficiency of resource utilization uh

2015
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:09,199
for the roots uh the strict uh latency

2016
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:11,760
and the jitter commitment peru should be

2017
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,719
provided and it must not change due to

2018
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:18,000
the lateral changing it's especially in

2019
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,199
pref uh function like the

2020
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:22,320
owners

2021
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,639
proposed the latency and the jitter of

2022
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:28,239
the two disjoined rules uh we cannot

2023
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:30,800
have two big difference and cannot be

2024
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,000
changing

2025
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,120
moreover interdomains root should be

2026
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,520
taken into consideration

2027
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,880
and the second part for the wide aerial

2028
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:43,280
network the two features are largely

2029
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,920
older large-scale network and

2030
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,639
multiple dynamic flows

2031
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:50,000
there will be

2032
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,120
large scale levels overloads and

2033
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,480
long-distance

2034
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,639
links and they will

2035
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:58,880
impact on the latency and the

2036
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,600
jitter and the multiple capabilities

2037
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,800
will be

2038
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,639
existed such as flexi and sr turners

2039
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:10,320
and maybe multiple queen mechanisms are

2040
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,199
provided and co existed

2041
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,440
and finally there are also large number

2042
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:18,800
and multiple types over dynamic flows

2043
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,080
coexist

2044
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:24,159
uh so micro bursts may be emerged from

2045
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:25,280
multiple

2046
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,480
flows

2047
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:29,440
last slide please

2048
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:37,440
so uh based on the problems

2049
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:41,199
for uh with the white aerial ip

2050
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:44,400
did administer networking uh we listed

2051
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,000
the requirements

2052
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,199
uh based on the problems first is the

2053
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:51,679
differentiated the network uh

2054
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:53,360
differentiated the battle desolate

2055
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:56,719
queues of the multi multiple services

2056
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:59,199
their deflate flows could be classified

2057
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:00,639
based on their

2058
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:04,480
data cues in the figure show for example

2059
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,880
over deterministic service can be

2060
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,719
provided such as low latency jitter and

2061
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:11,520
the

2062
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:15,199
low latency just low latency and so on

2063
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:18,000
second is the large scale

2064
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,120
network it's a it is required to reduce

2065
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:24,239
the size of the lateral topology and

2066
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:27,120
integrate their multi comp scalability

2067
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,400
resource to

2068
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:32,800
achieve the optimal beta data use

2069
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,199
third is the high efficiency of the

2070
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:38,000
resource and the rules

2071
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,920
resource

2072
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:42,719
classification and modeling is required

2073
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:44,320
along the

2074
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,880
explicit path with

2075
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,760
the route with the

2076
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,000
guarantees such as

2077
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,440
bandwides lanterns jitter and the packet

2078
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:59,199
loss should be provided the last one is

2079
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:03,520
the guarantees of multiple dynamic

2080
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:04,400
flows

2081
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,360
so shaping and their queen processing

2082
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,880
and their

2083
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,440
aggregation of multiple flows should be

2084
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:15,920
provided to reduce the micro uh burst

2085
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,320
last night

2086
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:27,040
so this is the solutions considerations

2087
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:30,320
for the wider area ip deterministic

2088
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,719
networking

2089
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:34,480
we

2090
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:37,520
for the solutions uh we suggest to solve

2091
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:38,560
it from

2092
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,440
three direction first step is to uh

2093
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:42,480
locate

2094
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,199
deterministic resources second step is

2095
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:48,480
to establish the domestic routes and the

2096
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,960
validity to achieve their deterministic

2097
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:53,520
accused

2098
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,639
so last night please

2099
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:02,159
so uh the the draft is also about the

2100
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:06,159
requirement or for the large-scale uh or

2101
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:08,320
wide aerial um

2102
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:11,520
net deterministic networking uh we

2103
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,159
welcome the comments and this discussion

2104
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:16,480
thank you

2105
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:24,759
comments question

2106
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,320
i think it's the right direction to

2107
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,199
classify the categories of levels of use

2108
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:42,639
case but

2109
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:44,719
the problem is that whether it is the

2110
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:46,239
right time to be

2111
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:48,400
standardized now uh maybe

2112
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,520
in the future

2113
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,159
more suitable because in

2114
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:54,080
the previous draft

2115
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,800
we also mentioned that but we don't give

2116
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,440
the details of of it

2117
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:02,320
and for this draft i think um

2118
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,960
some details of analysis are expected

2119
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,760
and since it's a little um conceptual i

2120
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:08,880
think

2121
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,920
and another question is that we have two

2122
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,920
requirements draft

2123
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,520
and what

2124
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,440
i would ask what's the other i think

2125
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:20,320
about that yeah

2126
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,760
yeah thank you uh so for the first

2127
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,880
question

2128
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,480
brings you

2129
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:31,520
a classification uh over the deafness

2130
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,040
service and dirty uh the details

2131
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,679
should be provided um

2132
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:38,400
so

2133
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,159
we will um

2134
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:41,360
do the

2135
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,400
research and

2136
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:47,040
provide the details

2137
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,080
for the

2138
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,199
um

2139
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:53,839
classification of the data service

2140
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:56,080
not just their

2141
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,360
their uh

2142
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,560
not

2143
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,880
the nancy and the jitter

2144
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:03,520
we will provide the

2145
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,639
clarification for the

2146
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:10,560
other requirements in the draft

2147
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,080
it looks like there's a good opportunity

2148
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,600
to discuss this builder on the list i

2149
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,280
think you know if we can

2150
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:20,639
look at having the documents be merged

2151
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,000
that would be great

2152
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,520
if not if we could figure out where

2153
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,800
there's agreement and disagreement

2154
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:30,600
thank you very much

2155
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:36,320
so i believe you're originally scheduled

2156
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,320
for 15 minutes uh we only have 10

2157
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:41,360
minutes available for you

2158
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:42,800
[Music]

2159
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,800
yes please proceed

2160
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:47,199
okay thank you

2161
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:49,920
china um and this is a

2162
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,840
false version of the microphones

2163
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,920
decreasing

2164
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:57,360
in this layer 3 network for low limited

2165
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,920
traffic dropped

2166
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:03,239
next please

2167
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,239
next second

2168
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:07,600
this page will

2169
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,679
show some modifications

2170
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:11,120
firstly we

2171
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,679
adjust the catalog to clarify the

2172
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:15,440
purpose of the draft

2173
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:17,520
our purpose is to

2174
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:21,440
explore explore the methods to decrease

2175
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:24,480
microbursts in the network and

2176
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:27,360
we add a new session to

2177
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:31,040
analyze the requirement of the method to

2178
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:32,080
decrease

2179
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:33,600
the macro first

2180
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,560
and as an example we we

2181
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,120
show we introduce a

2182
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,040
method

2183
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,000
to

2184
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,880
decrease the microburst

2185
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,760
next page please

2186
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,679
okay this is a

2187
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:52,960
simple test

2188
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:56,159
uh from my colleague and

2189
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:58,960
we want to show this page to show that

2190
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,239
the

2191
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:02,080
traffic has uh

2192
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,960
instinct or positiveness

2193
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,880
i i will introduce uh something about it

2194
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:12,400
the traffic passed through a 4g network

2195
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,960
and fixed the access network

2196
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,239
and

2197
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:20,719
they are between two cpes with gps

2198
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:24,639
a test package will be sent every

2199
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:27,120
60 millisecond

2200
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,239
and

2201
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:31,520
the test lasts about 10 hours the

2202
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:34,480
minimal delay between the two

2203
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:37,120
is about seven milliseconds and the

2204
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:39,360
maximum delay is about

2205
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:42,480
700 millisecond and the average delays

2206
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,000
is about

2207
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,080
26 milliseconds

2208
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,800
it can be observed that the ip traffic

2209
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,120
has uh instinct or

2210
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,120
both he needs because

2211
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,639
we can see that some of the packet

2212
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:00,239
experience a long delay in the

2213
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:02,159
between the two cpes

2214
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:05,120
next page please

2215
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,280
okay

2216
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,560
we introduced three ways to disco

2217
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:16,320
decrease the microburst

2218
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:19,360
this document uh many folks on the micro

2219
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,280
bus on the interface

2220
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:24,960
which is different from the the micro

2221
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,520
aspects in the previous

2222
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:30,560
page but they show similar

2223
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,520
characteristics

2224
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,280
the three ways

2225
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:36,400
including

2226
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,120
includes uh the traditional ip in a

2227
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:40,080
light

2228
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,480
loaded network

2229
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:45,600
this second scenario is very similar to

2230
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,040
the

2231
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,320
situation of the last page and the

2232
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:54,239
second is the tsm mechanism such as cqf

2233
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:57,679
it means cyclic cueing and folding and

2234
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:01,520
the last method is introduced in

2235
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:05,120
in this chart as an example to decrease

2236
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:07,679
the microburst on the interface

2237
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:10,639
next page please

2238
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:14,960
and this page will introduce the

2239
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:18,719
traditional ip in a light loaded network

2240
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:21,280
a network will be not

2241
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:23,840
will not be

2242
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,719
congested for critical traffic

2243
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:28,159
only if that

2244
01:34:28,159 --> 01:34:30,159
the criterial traffic has a

2245
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:32,320
higher priority and there is only a

2246
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,880
small amount of critical traffic in the

2247
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:35,920
network

2248
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:39,040
uh however in in that night we want to

2249
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,280
convey more critical traffic in the

2250
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,360
network

2251
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:46,639
so this traditional ip method perhaps

2252
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:49,360
not super for the for our mechanism

2253
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,480
being

2254
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,880
considered in that net

2255
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,000
but uh

2256
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,520
the ipod has a good

2257
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:00,159
scalability because most in most cases

2258
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:01,040
only

2259
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,960
perpetuate the treatment in the

2260
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,960
forwarding node is needed

2261
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,480
but in theory

2262
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:09,280
every folding can only provide an

2263
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,440
unreliable connection

2264
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:14,560
as shown in the last page we can see

2265
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:15,280
that

2266
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:18,480
some sometimes a long delay is

2267
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,520
caused by the person in the network

2268
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:24,960
the next next page please

2269
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:30,159
the second method to decrease uh the

2270
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:32,320
microphones in the network is the tsm

2271
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,560
mechanism such as the cqf

2272
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,679
uh of course the ctsm mechanism all can

2273
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:39,679
provide a reliable path through the

2274
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:40,800
network

2275
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,880
uh in that net network uh the be traffic

2276
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:47,440
will be forwarded by using the

2277
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:50,000
traditional ip forwarding method

2278
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,560
and the deadnet traffic will be

2279
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:55,840
forwarded by using the tsa mechanism

2280
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,239
however the test mechanisms are much

2281
01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:01,920
more complicated than the ip folding so

2282
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,239
they cannot have a good scalability as

2283
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:07,199
the traditional ip40 does

2284
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:08,000
but

2285
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
we think that the scalability is

2286
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,360
essential for

2287
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:14,560
a large scale network

2288
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:17,600
next spirit please

2289
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:22,080
so we explore a third method

2290
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:25,520
we are looking for a mechanism that

2291
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,920
firstly it it can have a good

2292
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,360
scalability

2293
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:32,000
uh it is to say that the intermediate

2294
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,480
node should not uh perform a process on

2295
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:40,239
the data plan and it also can provide a

2296
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:42,159
better performance for the critical

2297
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:43,679
traffic

2298
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:45,119
it is to see that

2299
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:47,440
we can provide a different treatment for

2300
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:49,520
the critical traffic and

2301
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:50,880
then we go

2302
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,639
get a better

2303
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:55,199
user experience

2304
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:57,760
on the inter intermediate node we

2305
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:00,880
suggest to separate the process or

2306
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:04,639
control plan the data plan

2307
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:06,960
because we think that in a large-scale

2308
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:10,080
network the status on the aggregated

2309
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,760
detonate traffic

2310
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,440
on the control plane may change

2311
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:14,719
frequently

2312
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:15,600
uh

2313
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:19,040
because uh the the the track the net

2314
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:23,040
flow may contain a lot of subfloors

2315
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,080
and they

2316
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:25,600
are aggregated

2317
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:28,080
uh we should not assume that a control

2318
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,159
plant on the intermediate node can

2319
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:32,480
interact with the data frequently for

2320
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:33,600
example

2321
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:37,280
to change a shipper parameter frequently

2322
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,480
we think that

2323
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:40,639
on the date plan some self-decision

2324
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:42,880
process should be supported

2325
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,920
next paid please

2326
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:51,280
so uh we propose a method as an example

2327
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,800
in this method

2328
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,119
we can do the shipping on at the end

2329
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:58,000
edge and try to keep the traffic shaped

2330
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,239
on the intermediate node

2331
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:01,119
we

2332
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:02,719
do the uh

2333
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:05,440
we on the intermediate node

2334
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:08,000
an intermediate node the graduated

2335
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,159
critical traffic will be shipped again

2336
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:12,159
as a whole on the interface

2337
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:15,199
uh we suggest some self-decision process

2338
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:16,480
in the shipping

2339
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,239
and the purpose is to maintain a

2340
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:21,119
reliable or reasonable buffer death

2341
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:24,559
while shipping the traffic

2342
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:27,440
the first step in our stock is that

2343
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,360
not to forward the packet as soon as

2344
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,040
possible

2345
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,679
as the traditional ip forwarding does

2346
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:36,239
because we think it is one of the reason

2347
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:39,360
causing the microburst on the interface

2348
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:42,839
next page please

2349
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:46,560
it's about the next time or the drop

2350
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:47,460
we will

2351
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:48,800
[Music]

2352
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:51,040
call for comments and continue to modify

2353
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,119
the draft and we also call for

2354
01:38:53,119 --> 01:38:55,280
contributions from anyone who are

2355
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,119
interested in the work

2356
01:38:57,119 --> 01:39:01,119
uh i think this is the last one last

2357
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:05,839
page and welcome for comments thank you

2358
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:10,360
any comments

2359
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,199
uh thank you for contributing the work

2360
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:17,280
and we look for a discussion on the list

2361
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:20,320
and uh anyone who's interested uh please

2362
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:21,119
uh

2363
01:39:21,119 --> 01:39:22,000
uh

2364
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,440
you know contact the authors or make

2365
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,520
comments on the list uh

2366
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,800
thank you

2367
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:33,119
next up

2368
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:36,679
i guess tourists

2369
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:44,960
all right

2370
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:47,600
so this is about the um

2371
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:48,639
uh

2372
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:50,320
oh the title is wrong this is about the

2373
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,480
mpls um

2374
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:56,159
tech uh traffic class queueing uh for

2375
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:59,199
cqf next slide

2376
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,800
so the the concept of tech cyclic

2377
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,800
queueing and forwarding was proposed to

2378
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:10,719
that a long time ago that was in um

2379
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:13,760
i really only get one minute

2380
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:16,239
sorry my counter is at 30 seconds maybe

2381
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:17,920
that hopefully that's wrong i'll there

2382
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:19,520
are too many buttons i just haven't

2383
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:20,800
updated it yet

2384
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:22,960
sure um

2385
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,560
right so um

2386
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:27,520
so we introduced that uh in 2018 first

2387
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,239
uh

2388
01:40:28,239 --> 01:40:30,320
as a concept and you know

2389
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:33,199
got uh you know lost uh running around

2390
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:33,920
in

2391
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,719
itf working groups to figure out where

2392
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:39,119
we could standardize this um then we

2393
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:42,480
reintroduced the concept in 2021 with a

2394
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:45,360
new variation of that draft so i think

2395
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,280
you know that's that's why we said let's

2396
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,400
let's let's

2397
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,080
make make something that actually can be

2398
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:52,960
standardized by uh um you know writing

2399
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:55,119
down uh how this would actually work

2400
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:58,000
with the encapsulation that we have

2401
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,480
and otherwise complete data plan for

2402
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:01,920
which is mpls

2403
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,119
um

2404
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:06,239
and so uh the beauty is also that um it

2405
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:09,040
only requires uh some three to five

2406
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:12,800
values out of uh you know um a qs field

2407
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,639
and so in mpls we're using the traffic

2408
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:16,880
class field so we introduce and explain

2409
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:19,280
that work in the interim um so the 01

2410
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:21,760
version added a co-author

2411
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,040
and that one

2412
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,920
thanks andy had kind of alerted me to

2413
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:27,360
the problems with the yang so i had

2414
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,440
longer discussion also with young expert

2415
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,520
and i ended up removing the yang

2416
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,840
references and text from it and replaced

2417
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:36,080
it with uh something that you know would

2418
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,480
allow us to forward to to carry forward

2419
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:41,520
with the specification independent of an

2420
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:44,560
additional yang model to to manage it um

2421
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:47,280
so that we don't get that conflation of

2422
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:51,679
of context in one document uh next slide

2423
01:41:53,199 --> 01:41:55,840
okay just a quick summary so

2424
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,960
cyclic cueing and forwarding um

2425
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:02,159
is a an old technology from tsn that's

2426
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:05,840
uh available um and used in

2427
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,719
campus industrial networks um with

2428
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:10,080
speeds uh

2429
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:12,000
smaller than or maybe even up to 10

2430
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,080
gigabits it uses two cycles for the

2431
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:17,040
forwarding uh the main issues is that

2432
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:19,360
when you go to higher speeds

2433
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,679
the um

2434
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:23,280
clock synchronization accuracy

2435
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,679
requirement goes up linear with speed

2436
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:27,360
which also means that the cost of the

2437
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:29,840
clock synchronization goes up with speed

2438
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:32,800
and it cannot support um you know links

2439
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:36,400
of varying or larger latency because it

2440
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,639
is synchronizing packets upon receipt

2441
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:41,280
based on the receive timestamp of the

2442
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:43,600
packet um and not something in the

2443
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,920
packet so um you know the latency of the

2444
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,840
links has to be very small so something

2445
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:50,400
like a few kilometers so the the

2446
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:52,400
solution and that was even you know

2447
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:54,719
discussed in tsn but obviously adding a

2448
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:56,960
packet header field is always pain so

2449
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:59,280
that's why also a tsn didn't want to do

2450
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:00,000
it

2451
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,920
but that is really what is necessary to

2452
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,159
reduce the requirement

2453
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:06,880
in clock synchronization

2454
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,480
and its cost

2455
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:11,119
and then allow arbitrary long wide area

2456
01:43:11,119 --> 01:43:13,679
network links and also links with jitter

2457
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:15,119
that obviously even in you know

2458
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:17,040
high-speed gigabit ethernet and other

2459
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:19,199
links like mobile links come through

2460
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:21,360
forward error correction and uh

2461
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:23,600
re-transmissions at at lincoln lower

2462
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:24,400
layer

2463
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:27,520
um so that

2464
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,920
technology is working in hardware so uh

2465
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:30,880
we

2466
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:33,360
we did prove that with um you know proof

2467
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,360
of concept hardware implementation just

2468
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:37,119
on fpga

2469
01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:40,159
for that cyclic queuing and 100 gigabit

2470
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:43,760
um standard metropolitan and uh wide

2471
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,360
area network routers

2472
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:48,719
so at 2 000 kilometer range and less

2473
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:50,960
than 100 microsecond end-to-end jitter

2474
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,119
because that was just the cycle time and

2475
01:43:53,119 --> 01:43:55,360
i'm not going to go in the details of

2476
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:58,320
how multi more cycles like shown on the

2477
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:01,360
right give you more uh variability in

2478
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,920
you know jitter or clock inaccuracy but

2479
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:05,840
that's pretty much the reason to go for

2480
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:10,239
more than three cycles next slide

2481
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,840
so why is this important and that goes

2482
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:15,840
back to the two big challenges the

2483
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,920
operator we want to have a service

2484
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:20,560
provider class network solution for that

2485
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:23,679
net to be successful even enterprises

2486
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:25,040
want to adapt standard network

2487
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:26,560
operational models from service

2488
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:29,280
providers for anything that is larger

2489
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:30,800
than you know

2490
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:33,119
a building network so

2491
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:36,239
we do not want to have perhaps per flow

2492
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:39,360
shaper state for the bounded latency and

2493
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:41,360
cqf is the only relevant proven

2494
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:44,000
standardized option today and in this

2495
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,440
tcqf this tech cqf simply expands it

2496
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,679
to you know the tagging in the packet as

2497
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:52,159
opposed to derived from the timestamp

2498
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:53,679
and then of course the challenge number

2499
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:55,840
two and we heard that from the prior two

2500
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,199
talks as well

2501
01:44:57,199 --> 01:44:59,920
most industrial tsn applications want

2502
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:02,960
and need low jitter for example higher

2503
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:05,600
jitter may incr introduce

2504
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:07,760
the need to run ptp in the network

2505
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,280
purely for client devices add ptp stacks

2506
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:14,159
to the client devices to resync control

2507
01:45:14,159 --> 01:45:17,360
loops because of the introduced jitter

2508
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:18,400
and

2509
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:20,880
the current uh uh

2510
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:24,639
latency alternatives to cqf have really

2511
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:27,199
the maximum jitter right so zero queuing

2512
01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:29,199
latency when there is no competing

2513
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:31,679
traffic and maximum latency under

2514
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:33,280
maximum um

2515
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,440
competing traffic so

2516
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:37,280
tech secure is my opinion really the

2517
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:40,080
only short-term option that solves both

2518
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,560
challenges um there are some other

2519
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:44,639
options but they would all require new

2520
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:46,800
packet headers because they can't get

2521
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:49,760
away with just a few uh values to

2522
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,920
indicate the necessary you know queueing

2523
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:54,080
state that we need to make it work

2524
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:56,159
um

2525
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:58,159
and and you know all of these you know

2526
01:45:58,159 --> 01:46:00,800
additional options don't have any um i

2527
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:03,520
think um deployment validation or

2528
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:06,080
standardization uh uh

2529
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:09,760
track record next slide

2530
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:14,080
so yeah so this is this is basically all

2531
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:16,719
the stuff that we could do beyond um

2532
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:19,280
this draft and where it gets interesting

2533
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:22,639
but also difficult um

2534
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:23,679
so

2535
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:25,440
and that gets pretty much to extension

2536
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:28,159
headers um for uh what we want to do um

2537
01:46:28,159 --> 01:46:30,960
so we could do one for bounded latency

2538
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,679
now um for for for additional proposals

2539
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:35,280
but i think we should be careful not to

2540
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:38,080
do a one-off right so um

2541
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:40,480
and maybe you know in the matter of time

2542
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:42,400
not go through all of this but so there

2543
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,159
were other in in the interim there were

2544
01:46:44,159 --> 01:46:47,199
other um you know options for uh low

2545
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:49,760
jitter brought up i also um you know

2546
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:52,080
published one particular mechanism last

2547
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:54,320
month so feel free to read up on that

2548
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:56,000
all of these options may have slightly

2549
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,920
different parameters mine for example

2550
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,320
has one time stem and then a sequence of

2551
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:03,360
priorities to achieve the same calculus

2552
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:06,400
that tsn ats has so that it can be

2553
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:08,719
pushed back but you know there are one

2554
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:11,040
of other things um you know um jack of

2555
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,360
stein proposed a stochastical bounded

2556
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:16,000
latency solution so i think all of this

2557
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,040
is much further out before we could

2558
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:21,119
successfully deploy it i hope we can and

2559
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:22,560
will work on it

2560
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,800
but so i think that that puts it in a

2561
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:27,600
separate bucket from the tcqf which i

2562
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:30,159
think is ready to deploy now if we had a

2563
01:47:30,159 --> 01:47:32,000
standard to actually allow

2564
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,840
interoperability so

2565
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:36,000
which brings us to the final slide next

2566
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,480
slide please

2567
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:41,920
so here are pretty much my two asks

2568
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:44,320
right so you know working group adoption

2569
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,000
for uh this

2570
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,679
tech cqf

2571
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:49,840
draft

2572
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:52,320
and um you know if if that cannot be

2573
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:54,080
adopted because there may need to be

2574
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:56,639
charter changes uh let's let's try to

2575
01:47:56,639 --> 01:47:58,080
figure out how to work through that

2576
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:00,320
process quickly i don't think uh it

2577
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:02,239
really would need to you know be

2578
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:04,560
considered to be any different from the

2579
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,719
pre-op work that we're doing which also

2580
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:08,960
deals with algorithms in the routers and

2581
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:11,600
has since we started that net

2582
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:13,600
and then the second ask is to think

2583
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,840
about how we can get towards something

2584
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:18,400
like a net us design team with more

2585
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:21,119
regular and informal meetings uh yeah

2586
01:48:21,119 --> 01:48:22,800
but thanks for the working group chair

2587
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:24,960
slides that you'll make the with the

2588
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,440
webex available so that's great too

2589
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:30,159
pre-off latency um not sure if there's

2590
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:32,800
anything else on the qs side um and then

2591
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,560
maybe you know start discussing there

2592
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:36,320
the uh

2593
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,719
the current drafts uh that we already

2594
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:40,239
have i want to bring into the working

2595
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:42,320
group for for the round one deliverables

2596
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,960
and then the round two um for these you

2597
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:47,920
know new packet header encapsulations

2598
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,280
what functionality you want to have

2599
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,320
there

2600
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:53,360
all right that's it thank you

2601
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:01,360
thank you dollas so maybe one one

2602
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:03,440
thought on um

2603
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:05,840
the working group adoption that uh

2604
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,080
uh perhaps uh so so we are developing

2605
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:09,840
the requirements

2606
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:13,599
and i think that goes before solution

2607
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:15,440
so i guess it would be good to have a

2608
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:17,599
working group document and developed by

2609
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:19,360
a working group agreed on requirements

2610
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:22,560
before diving into solution

2611
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,719
well i mean we've been you know on this

2612
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:27,360
for four years this is working we know

2613
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:29,520
the industry needs it

2614
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:32,560
this is this is not necessarily covering

2615
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:34,480
all the operational requirements that we

2616
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:35,360
have

2617
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:38,400
um so i think uh you know any of these

2618
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:41,040
larger scale requirements documents

2619
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:44,000
would be a broader scope then i think

2620
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,400
what we do agree to be you know uh the

2621
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:48,960
requirements for a bounded latency

2622
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:50,239
solution

2623
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:52,480
right and and and and remember that you

2624
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:53,280
know

2625
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,119
we don't even have anything for the

2626
01:49:55,119 --> 01:49:57,440
other bounded latency solutions from the

2627
01:49:57,440 --> 01:50:00,480
management plane either so i i think

2628
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:03,199
there is no need to delay um this this

2629
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:04,960
this this can be pretty much done in

2630
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:07,920
parallel and you know if in my working

2631
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:09,920
group the the ads even wanted us to

2632
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:11,840
first work on the solution in parallel

2633
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,159
if at all you know uh

2634
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:15,920
work through uh you know the other

2635
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:17,520
aspect so i think that's that's always

2636
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,199
in the eye of the beholder how to

2637
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:23,000
sequentialize things

2638
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:28,560
so i i do think we uh have a charter

2639
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:31,040
issue to work um the shares can start

2640
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:33,840
working that with the ad

2641
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:35,920
and

2642
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:36,800
probably

2643
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,800
come up with some proposed text maybe

2644
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:41,119
you would get the id at least to agree

2645
01:50:41,119 --> 01:50:42,880
with in principle and then bring it to

2646
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:45,199
the working group for review and comment

2647
01:50:45,199 --> 01:50:48,480
and run that process

2648
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:49,920
and

2649
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:51,679
in that time it would be great to see

2650
01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:54,159
more discussion and input

2651
01:50:54,159 --> 01:50:55,760
um into

2652
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:56,560
uh

2653
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:58,639
in this document and we can run those in

2654
01:50:58,639 --> 01:50:59,920
parallel

2655
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:02,159
um

2656
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:05,520
as i said right i think that that and i

2657
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:06,560
think that was a little bit the

2658
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:08,880
conclusion uh what you took down at the

2659
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:11,599
end of the interim i i think it mostly

2660
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:14,000
applies to what i had on my slide as the

2661
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,480
the second part which was you know uh

2662
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,480
looking into all these you know novel

2663
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:21,040
things as opposed to the very short-term

2664
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:22,960
things that we've also been doing with

2665
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:25,280
pre-off and where this air draft would

2666
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:27,360
fall into but yeah fine thanks yeah i

2667
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:29,040
mean we've had the discussion before the

2668
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:30,960
queueing has typically not been done in

2669
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:34,800
the routing area since this is um uh

2670
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:35,840
you know

2671
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:37,360
different for the routing area we want

2672
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:41,280
to make sure that the isg and the ad is

2673
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:43,040
fully on board with it i think just

2674
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:45,280
doing going off and doing it without

2675
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:47,040
their buy-in is just going to cause

2676
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:48,480
problems down the road when we try to

2677
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,880
advance it through the isg so

2678
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,239
again again

2679
01:51:52,239 --> 01:51:53,520
parallel

2680
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,000
we can run it in parallel and um

2681
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,639
uh certainly uh try to have um a text

2682
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:03,599
that is either uh complete or fairly

2683
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:06,639
mature by the next meeting

2684
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:08,800
well as i said in in one of the

2685
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:11,280
joint meetings i think we we did have

2686
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:13,040
the discussion i think that there were

2687
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:14,880
more people you know pointing to the

2688
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:17,520
fact that the work done on on pre-off

2689
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:19,520
you know is effectively also a qs

2690
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:22,159
function and that had been started

2691
01:52:22,159 --> 01:52:23,840
we can have that discussion on the list

2692
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,440
uh it's not going to change we're going

2693
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:27,840
to work with the ad on this sure and the

2694
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:31,599
isg so i mean we can keep talking um but

2695
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:33,520
uh we're out of time on this slot

2696
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:35,920
more discussion take it to the list uh

2697
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:38,159
certainly technical discussion we're

2698
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:40,480
hoping does happen on the list

2699
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:43,199
um and with that we're on our last slot

2700
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:45,839
one

2701
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:53,760
this is about the bgp flow specification

2702
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:56,480
for the flat flow mapping next slide

2703
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:59,480
please

2704
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:05,119
so this knight listed the rfcs related

2705
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:07,679
to tsm deadplanes

2706
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:11,280
including display framework ipo for tsm

2707
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:16,000
mps over tsm and tsm vpn over mps

2708
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,320
so in the figure show the

2709
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:21,679
satellite may provided the deterministic

2710
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:25,520
service for the tsm and the system and

2711
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:28,560
the deathlet ip and the mps flows may be

2712
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:31,840
carried over tsn sub networks

2713
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:34,800
let's slide please

2714
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:38,719
so

2715
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:40,639
we mainly discussed the

2716
01:53:40,639 --> 01:53:43,760
requirements for the flow mapping

2717
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:45,920
there are two parts over

2718
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:48,239
uh requirements for the flow mapping the

2719
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:51,119
first one is the primary primary

2720
01:53:51,119 --> 01:53:53,679
requirements of the controller play for

2721
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:57,199
the tsn and desolate flows mapping the

2722
01:53:57,199 --> 01:54:00,320
mapping between tsn streams and the data

2723
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:03,760
flows is required for the service proxy

2724
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:07,119
function at data engineers and the

2725
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:09,119
mapping table

2726
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:12,000
can be configured and maintained in the

2727
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,760
control plane

2728
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:16,400
second one is the aggregation over

2729
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,000
deadlift flows

2730
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,280
one two one and the n two one mapping

2731
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:23,679
must be supported

2732
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:27,119
for example aggregating multiple

2733
01:54:27,119 --> 01:54:30,159
tsn streams in a single internet flow

2734
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:32,080
must be supported

2735
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:34,840
so based on the

2736
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:38,719
requirements uh were provided in

2737
01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:42,719
their listed offices so this document

2738
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:44,159
proposes

2739
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:47,199
extensions in control play to

2740
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:51,199
uh bgp flow specification for their flow

2741
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:52,400
mapping

2742
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:55,599
by using their traffic filtering rules

2743
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:58,800
to identify the packet and they're using

2744
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:01,599
the association associated

2745
01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:05,280
action to map the packet to the related

2746
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:06,960
surface

2747
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:10,639
so let's just slide please

2748
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:13,199
so

2749
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:14,320
we

2750
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:15,760
proposed to

2751
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:18,960
extend the bgp

2752
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:22,400
flow specification for the tsn string

2753
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:25,760
mapping to that letter flow

2754
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:27,599
as we were learned the

2755
01:55:27,599 --> 01:55:30,000
string identification function are

2756
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,679
defined in

2757
01:55:31,679 --> 01:55:32,800
archery

2758
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:35,920
and so based on their existing uh

2759
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:38,639
filtering filtering rules

2760
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:41,440
this document proposed proposed earlier

2761
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:44,960
type in l2 components

2762
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:48,159
flows back type for tsm traffic

2763
01:55:48,159 --> 01:55:51,840
filtering uh for example the uh

2764
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:53,520
mask in

2765
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:55,599
uh the max

2766
01:55:55,599 --> 01:55:58,960
surface data unit unit in mask and the

2767
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:01,599
match screen identification

2768
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:03,440
so uh

2769
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:06,480
moreover for the traffic action of tsn

2770
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:08,639
strings the action is to

2771
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:11,280
uh define to

2772
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,599
accept their tests and streams that

2773
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:15,920
matches the rule and the mapped extremes

2774
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:18,719
to the data flows so this document also

2775
01:56:18,719 --> 01:56:21,599
proposes proposes the sequence action

2776
01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:24,480
extending the community

2777
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:28,040
next slide please

2778
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:30,639
so

2779
01:56:30,639 --> 01:56:32,880
and

2780
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:34,560
so forth there

2781
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:37,599
uh that last flow matching map into tsm

2782
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:41,520
string uh this document also proposes a

2783
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,679
dcw type in

2784
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:46,800
l3 components flows back uh for that

2785
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:50,320
letter mps flows uh the extended action

2786
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:54,000
for and data traffic filtering is to

2787
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,880
accept that flows that matches the death

2788
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:59,199
rule and the mapped flows to the tests

2789
01:56:59,199 --> 01:57:02,000
and strings so uh

2790
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:06,000
the document also proposes a test action

2791
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,400
uh extended community

2792
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:12,080
uh the test profile can be converted to

2793
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:12,880
the

2794
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:16,159
string related permit parameters and

2795
01:57:16,159 --> 01:57:19,119
requirements including ts string id

2796
01:57:19,119 --> 01:57:20,480
string handle

2797
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:22,880
sequence number and the traffic scale

2798
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:25,280
scheduling information

2799
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:28,239
let's select list

2800
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:33,119
so a last step

2801
01:57:33,119 --> 01:57:37,040
we plan to present and discuss in idr wg

2802
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:40,960
and we want to get more feedback

2803
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:43,199
uh comments and the discussion are very

2804
01:57:43,199 --> 01:57:46,080
welcome thank you

2805
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:50,560
any questions comments

2806
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:53,280
two minutes

2807
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,519
jeff

2808
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,320
thanks luke i'm going to apologize i

2809
01:57:58,320 --> 01:57:59,840
actually only caught a portion of the

2810
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:01,840
presentation after i was flagged about

2811
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:03,280
this um

2812
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:04,400
you know

2813
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:07,280
i've read the draft uh very slightly uh

2814
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:09,360
i do see that it is doing much work with

2815
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:10,480
flow spec

2816
01:58:10,480 --> 01:58:13,119
a quick word on that um

2817
01:58:13,119 --> 01:58:13,840
the

2818
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:15,280
base flow spec

2819
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:18,080
rfc which is the version of the protocol

2820
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:18,960
is

2821
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:20,880
known to not be extensible so there is

2822
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:23,119
work that is starting in idr to do a

2823
01:58:23,119 --> 01:58:25,520
flowspec v2 so i think you're going to

2824
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:27,840
find that uh some of your changes will

2825
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,679
probably require

2826
01:58:29,679 --> 01:58:31,599
the flowspec v2 work in order to become

2827
01:58:31,599 --> 01:58:32,719
a

2828
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:34,960
viable protocol component

2829
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:37,199
idr should be holding an interim on

2830
01:58:37,199 --> 01:58:39,280
flowspec sometime uh

2831
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:41,599
very likely early december and we'd

2832
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:44,639
invite you to present there

2833
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:50,080
thank you thank you i will

2834
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:53,599
thanks jeff and

2835
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:57,119
uh i will uh change that uh extensions

2836
01:58:57,119 --> 01:59:00,080
to flows back or version two last

2837
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:02,239
version

2838
01:59:02,239 --> 01:59:05,199
but in this presentation i

2839
01:59:05,199 --> 01:59:08,719
i i'd like to get some feedback

2840
01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:10,880
for the requirements

2841
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:13,520
of the flow mapping

2842
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:16,760
thank you

2843
01:59:17,119 --> 01:59:20,239
now from the uh i think the net side i

2844
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:23,280
think it's important to um qualify the

2845
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:25,840
document that it's really focused on tsn

2846
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:28,960
mapping not uh just generic

2847
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:31,920
net uh so making you know having the

2848
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:35,119
document identify its scope as tsn in

2849
01:59:35,119 --> 01:59:38,239
the title the abstract the

2850
01:59:38,239 --> 01:59:39,440
the narrative

2851
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:41,760
part that would be important

2852
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:43,679
in terms of the process standpoint i

2853
01:59:43,679 --> 01:59:46,239
think we you know i think debt net is

2854
01:59:46,239 --> 01:59:48,320
the chairs are happy for it to be run

2855
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:50,800
wherever the ad thinks is is appropriate

2856
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:54,320
whether that be net or idr uh sounds

2857
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:56,639
like it might be best to run it with idr

2858
01:59:56,639 --> 02:00:00,239
given where um uh flospec is and what

2859
02:00:00,239 --> 02:00:02,639
jeff commented uh i see he's back in

2860
02:00:02,639 --> 02:00:04,719
queue so i'd love to hear hear his

2861
02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:07,280
opinion on this as well

2862
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:09,440
thanks luke uh so the the first thing i

2863
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:12,800
was going to say is that we do have i'm

2864
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:15,199
having trouble loading my agenda whether

2865
02:00:15,199 --> 02:00:16,960
you're on the presentation slot or not

2866
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:18,560
but if you were not

2867
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:22,080
a presenter for idr's session tomorrow

2868
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:24,080
we do actually have some available time

2869
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:26,320
