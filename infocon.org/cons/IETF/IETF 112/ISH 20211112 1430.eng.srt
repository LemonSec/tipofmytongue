00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,680
to the the

22
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,000
medico and audio stuff

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,879
um

24
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,319
here's the note well

25
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,720
which is a you know kind of a wall of

26
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,959
text about you know hey if you're

27
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,360
participating in the ietf you need to

28
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,760
adhere to a bunch of policies um related

29
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,360
to ipr and a bunch of other things uh it

30
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,280
gives you links to working group process

31
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,840
and how things go um and then any

32
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,360
harassment and code of conduct and

33
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,519
things in copyright et cetera um for the

34
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,440
code of conduct um we're gonna get to

35
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,760
that a second for the ipr it's pretty

36
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,120
straightforward if you know anything you

37
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
speak up or if you contribute you need

38
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,640
to disclose

39
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,280
um straightforward we've got a slide on

40
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,040
the itf code of conduct since it's

41
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,560
friday hopefully you've all seen this

42
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,959
multiple times this work group has not

43
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,959
suffered from this problem but i guess

44
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,400
we want to show everybody the same so

45
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,080
kind of give everybody the guidelines

46
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,840
like basically treat everybody with

47
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,879
respect um try to speak slowly which i

48
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,640
often have a problem with so i will try

49
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,599
to do it slowly as well um please just

50
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,400
dispute ideas by using recent arguments

51
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,159
um use your best but judgment

52
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,480
engineering judgment um

53
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,840
please try to find the best solution for

54
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,280
the whole of the internet um it

55
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,360
contributes to the ongoing work by

56
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,599
you know the group of the itf

57
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,840
um remember that we

58
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,720
um the code of conduct guidelines uh

59
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,280
are applicable to both the meet echo

60
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,959
stream as well as the jabber and email

61
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,760
list and we appreciate you for

62
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,599
doing the right thing heretofore

63
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,199
again wish at ietf112

64
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,680
here's our quick uh agenda we'll do some

65
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,880
mistrivia

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,560
um

67
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,000
luckily the blue sheets are now

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,680
automatically generated

69
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,360
we did not coordinate this beforehand

70
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,720
but is there anyone that's willing to

71
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,440
take notes

72
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,320
for us and all we need is high um the

73
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,720
high points we don't need blow by blow

74
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,000
just any decisions we make

75
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,000
adam was that you saying yes yes that's

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,280
adam

77
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,320
awesome

78
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,960
um great so we got that we have a jabber

79
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,800
scribe luckily this is all kind of

80
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
integrated so i'm hoping that there's

81
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,479
anybody that's in the jabra stream that

82
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,800
that pops in um we'll be able to figure

83
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,400
that out so if anybody feels that they

84
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,560
they have any kind of audio problems

85
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,479
feel free to put like mic

86
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,919
um mic colon in front of their uh

87
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,080
you know points in the java room and or

88
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,000
in the chat and we can make sure it gets

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,680
discussed on

90
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
uh get some live time

91
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,199
uh

92
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,360
update that we're not just chartered so

93
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,639
basically our quick agenda is we're

94
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,400
going to talk about the draft um the

95
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,600
wish whip draft then we're going to have

96
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,919
some hackathon discussions um and then

97
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,520
some information implementation

98
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,840
experience from two implementers which i

99
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,840
think is great because it makes our job

100
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,360
a whole lot easier

101
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,320
as chairs when there's multiple sets of

102
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,600
implementers

103
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,080
would anyone like to bash the agenda

104
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,120
tim go ahead

105
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,000
just say i can add a kind of two seconds

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,160
of uh implementation experience as a

107
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,000
third implementation of

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,240
a client implementation i did

109
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,560
in the run-up to the hackathon

110
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
absolutely very exciting the more the

111
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,720
merrier is how i look at it oftentimes

112
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,639
we progress protocols in the ietf and

113
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,639
there's no one implementing them so it's

114
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,720
good that this is uh happening here i

115
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,639
guess my only note of caution is that um

116
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,840
we are supposed to

117
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
uh liaison slash discuss with other

118
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,199
working groups so one of the things that

119
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,800
i guess i want to talk about at the end

120
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,720
if we have time is at what point do we

121
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,120
need to uh

122
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,800
let other people know that we're having

123
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
this implementation experience going on

124
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,639
and what do we need to do to make sure

125
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,240
that we get reviewed from other working

126
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,360
groups before we proceed too far

127
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,600
so

128
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,039
with that though we're gonna jump right

129
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,880
in the draft

130
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,400
so sergio

131
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,120
feel free to take the floor sir yeah

132
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,199
so first slide please

133
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,160
so

134
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,120
uh

135
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,080
basically the first drop was the

136
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,199
and based on the version 2 of the

137
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,440
murillo whip

138
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,520
personal draft so this is the one that

139
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
we adopted in the last minute

140
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,319
and since that i we have incorporated

141
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,599
several changes into the the

142
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,560
into the

143
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,520
this

144
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,960
zero one version of the sweep

145
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,360
and mainly there was a from feedback

146
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,960
received by the

147
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,800
my in the mailing list about the produce

148
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,199
draft for example it do not require the

149
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,599
web server to be public accessible but

150
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,120
just

151
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
request that they either the server

152
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,880
retrieves no candidates so all the

153
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,400
candidates in the sap answer that are

154
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,880
returned from the in the in the sdp

155
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,880
answer

156
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,280
also some clarifications regarding the

157
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,599
responses of the of the tricky license

158
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,840
restart patch request to the endpoint

159
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,120
resource

160
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,800
it may need to differ to differentiate

161
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,400
that if it is

162
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,280
the server can return to different

163
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,240
the

164
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,400
response codes with container with or

165
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,080
without content regarding if it is a

166
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,000
nice trickle because

167
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,720
if the the server does not require

168
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,759
a to send back any new information or if

169
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,240
it is a nice restart it has to return a

170
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,520
200 ok with a with an sdp with the new a

171
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,000
ice username and fragment username

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,879
fragment and password so they also the

173
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,440
client can do the ice restart

174
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,120
properly

175
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,360
also remove the 405 response from the we

176
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,479
serve it if

177
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,120
it does not understand the

178
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,759
the the trigger lies request now we have

179
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,519
we are mandating that

180
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,760
all the service has to answer properly

181
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,159
and the servers are free any way to

182
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,159
ignore the the candidates anymore for

183
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,919
example if you are doing nice light you

184
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,399
have just returned 204 and

185
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,640
but we are not adding any complexity

186
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,440
about

187
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,160
uh

188
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,600
adding and

189
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,279
having the client to check if they're

190
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,959
the response curves and do one thing or

191
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,800
another depending

192
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,760
on on it so just say if you don't if the

193
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,920
server does not need to to do anything

194
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,360
with the

195
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,320
with the

196
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,720
you know ice candidates just ignore it

197
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,959
and it will be fine

198
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,920
and we have added a

199
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,760
and some handling of the out of the

200
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
order request because

201
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,720
yes colleen

202
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,880
just getting permission just getting my

203
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,160
permissions here so i i just want to

204
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,720
make sure i i understood that correctly

205
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,600
so

206
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,760
it when we get this patch with the new

207
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,720
sdp on the server you can basically

208
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,640
ignore all the stuff that's in it like

209
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,320
that doesn't that doesn't sound really

210
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,519
very right to me it sounds like that

211
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,200
will create lots of problems if some

212
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,120
clients are processing the stp and some

213
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,200
are not processing the stp

214
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,040
it's not the is the servers i mean if

215
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,360
you are doing nice light i mean you can

216
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,040
you don't need the the ice candy there's

217
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,720
returns from there i'm not even talking

218
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,399
about the but

219
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,240
like like if you get a patch with a new

220
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,080
piece of stp do you have to yeah and

221
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,000
they have misunderstood what you said

222
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,800
actually i guess was just my question i

223
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,160
mean yeah okay when you get a pass with

224
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,560
sdp do you have to process it like like

225
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,279
you would in json

226
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,839
yeah well the the the patch information

227
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,480
is the only contains the

228
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,480
the ice candidate so we can only contact

229
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,360
the

230
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,279
the a new ice candidate or the

231
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,680
information up for doing a nice restart

232
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,279
so

233
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,600
so it's not changing any any kind of

234
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,040
other parameters that are not ice

235
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,880
related so it can only be triggered for

236
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,600
an uh trigger lice for for providing new

237
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,720
candidates

238
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,760
or for a new username and friend men for

239
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,440
doing a nice restart

240
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,720
so

241
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,040
okay so okay so again so this is deeply

242
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,800
limited what can be in that patch to

243
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,560
just what just the only thing that's

244
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,680
allowed to change is tricklized

245
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
candidates basically yeah

246
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680
yeah okay okay so i misunderstood what

247
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,959
you said in that

248
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,480
he's like that makes more sense now

249
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,600
thank you

250
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,279
yeah number one

251
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,839
and also the last point was a uh

252
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,160
attempted team about how to handle auto

253
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,320
for the request i think it is further

254
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,640
displaying in sslide

255
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,040
also clarification on

256
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,240
on

257
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,040
on authentication and what is the and

258
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,880
the token generation

259
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,560
usage because it was

260
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
misunderstood by some people that we

261
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,760
needed to use allows to talk as in in

262
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,360
the video header and it is just

263
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,600
explaining that the the token generation

264
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,079
is just up to the to the server to

265
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,720
decide what is the their meaning and

266
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,920
usage

267
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,200
and the only thing that the client has

268
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,000
to do is just to populate the

269
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,320
the authentication header with the video

270
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,760
extension

271
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,839
also we have added a new

272
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,399
and a new option to provide the tour

273
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,160
server configuration via the link

274
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,040
headers both in or in the

275
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,839
opt-in requests on the 200 response

276
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,959
there is more on this later

277
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,680
and also just one

278
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,880
one

279
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,040
restriction to just do not allow

280
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,760
redirection on the resource url so the

281
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,959
location

282
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,440
header the that it's returning in the

283
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,560
200 okay must be a final response

284
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,839
a final url so just to prevent

285
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,040
any kind of a issues in the in the

286
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,279
implementations

287
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,639
so next slide please

288
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,639
this is the first thing that i have a

289
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,920
question that last point so that is

290
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,360
basically saying we can't have any 300

291
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,720
class responses

292
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,279
when posting to this is the the resource

293
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,440
url or like the initial url or the one

294
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,959
that you get back from it

295
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,440
the the one you get back from it i okay

296
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,360
the first one is still redirect right

297
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,680
yeah i i still wanted to

298
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,240
or i'm open to discuss the the first one

299
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,079
because the problem is that

300
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,560
typically the the libraries when you are

301
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,240
doing http

302
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,800
does not automatically perform

303
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,000
redirections on posts with bodies

304
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,600
so it will be

305
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,040
up to the the client has to

306
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,240
retrieve the to the 307

307
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,800
request and do another request

308
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,000
so

309
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
and i think for example that none of the

310
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,600
clients that we are

311
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,399
we

312
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,000
have tested in the hackathons are

313
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,839
actually doing that

314
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,079
so maybe it's a question something that

315
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,600
we have to to

316
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,959
to think about

317
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,360
because it will probably be not very

318
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,079
widely implemented so better just remove

319
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,680
the

320
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,360
the

321
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,440
the requirement for the draft but

322
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,160
i'm open to discuss on this

323
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,760
okay thank you yeah i'll think about

324
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,120
that a bit more

325
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,040
yeah

326
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,639
so a

327
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,959
one thing that has

328
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,079
been

329
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,720
come up from the

330
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,920
from the

331
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,440
from both the implementation of the of

332
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,199
the draft is that the sdp fragment

333
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,600
that we are using the and we are

334
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,680
reaching i think this is the fragment

335
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,560
for

336
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,880
project lights it's a bit awkward to be

337
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,839
used

338
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,440
because if

339
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,839
especially because we are doing bundle

340
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,959
so

341
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,680
you have to and then the

342
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,279
the

343
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,000
the abn f of the of the

344
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,639
of the zp of the sdp fragment does not

345
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,639
allow the candidates to be at session

346
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,279
level and it also force you to to put

347
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,880
rtp abp

348
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,839
so it is kind of

349
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,680
very very awkward because we are in

350
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,519
webrtc we are not us doing rtp abp

351
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,560
so

352
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,600
the question is if we continue using

353
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,800
this

354
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,440
then the sat format that it is a

355
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,279
in the in the

356
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,279
sdp fragment rcc or we just extend the

357
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,360
abn f that it is something that it is

358
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,959
allowed by the by the rcc and just

359
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,480
allow the candidates and ice stuff to be

360
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,880
also present at session level so we

361
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,519
don't have to include the the m the fake

362
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,399
m

363
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,839
and line with the mid that it

364
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,120
is has no meaning for us

365
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
so that's the first question i'm not

366
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,959
sure if

367
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,600
i would personally prefer it but as a we

368
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,560
have to stand on different rpc i don't

369
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,480
know how it is

370
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,920
if it is visible or not

371
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,040
i'm not sure if anyone has a view on

372
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,279
this

373
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,040
or if we can just discuss it later on on

374
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,839
the mailing list

375
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,480
okay yeah

376
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,839
i'm not sure people fully understand

377
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,680
what you're proposing here i know i

378
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,600
i don't understand why this is or what

379
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,120
you're proposing changing i just don't

380
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,880
think i followed it i don't know i

381
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,600
didn't understand okay so

382
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,519
yeah let me explain the the first part

383
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,639
of the

384
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,680
the

385
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,079
the first part in is

386
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,920
what we are sending now that it is

387
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,639
according to the to the sdp fragment i

388
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,240
think it was i don't know regardless

389
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,000
only the direct number

390
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,720
but

391
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,279
it does not allow the sap fragment

392
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,480
allows you to send any valid sdp so any

393
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,880
a bnf that's in right

394
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,160
so

395
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,079
no the the one we're using is the

396
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,240
um

397
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,959
it requires

398
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,360
let me find it because i don't know

399
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
salid from memory

400
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,120
if anyone can find anything faster than

401
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,480
that i don't know i could remember very

402
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,839
wrong too i mean adam was involved with

403
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,120
this i think he probably remembers too

404
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,399
yeah so rfc88

405
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,439
840

406
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,480
the ibnf in the session level

407
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,360
does not allow the ice candidates it

408
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,920
must be in the media in the media level

409
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,800
so you want to drive

410
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,480
c840 i'm going to 9.2 grammar

411
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
we are restricted on one we are allowed

412
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,959
to send in a in the session level

413
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,119
in the session level so for example we

414
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,799
cannot send the ice candidates and these

415
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,599
candidates can only be sent in the

416
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,918
in the

417
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,880
in the media level

418
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,880
okay

419
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,799
so in this so the idea would be to

420
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,200
extend this abn f and to allow the

421
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,520
electricalized attribute fields to be

422
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,200
also be using

423
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,000
in session level so we can avoid i think

424
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,440
it's a little bit more complicated now i

425
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,640
think you need to go

426
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,880
change a version of patch that allows

427
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
that right i mean it's not just like

428
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,400
changing the a b and f will magically

429
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,760
make this go away i mean whatever

430
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,520
reasons that's like that in the original

431
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,960
giraffe needs like we need a different

432
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,799
it's no longer patched once we do this

433
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,039
right that's what you're doing

434
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,280
it is but the only thing is that as we

435
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,960
are doing bundle

436
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,000
we don't need the the candidates in each

437
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,679
media line we just can send the

438
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,120
candidates for

439
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,520
a at session level

440
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,360
meaning that it will apply to all media

441
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,600
levels in fact we are just

442
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,840
asking to to only send the the

443
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,559
candidates for the first the first media

444
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,679
level so both it is just a matter of

445
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,679
syntax is the the meaning necessarily

446
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,080
the same

447
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,640
and so

448
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,480
because we're bundled and we would not

449
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,080
have to like we'd have to send the same

450
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,280
candidates multiple times that's what

451
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,200
you're trying to avoid

452
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
yeah and also trying to to clean up a

453
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,360
bit of the syntax

454
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
like bundle is required by the spec

455
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
right now and so he's saying basically

456
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,919
like you're that that results in the

457
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,160
different media sections not being able

458
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,080
to go to different servers

459
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,000
so why do we need to repeat all the ice

460
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,679
candidates in all the different media

461
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,280
sections why not put them in the session

462
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,880
level make it clear like rebundling

463
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,280
there's only one ice session it cannot

464
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,600
go to different servers

465
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
but it requires spec changes i think

466
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,520
that's what sergio is trying to ask you

467
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,760
yeah just to clarify i mean we are

468
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,640
requiring bundle to be always being used

469
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,720
so just to simplify the implementation

470
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,120
and i mean the first one the the the

471
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,200
first dp fragment is working right now

472
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,640
the only thing is that it is a bit that

473
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,760
one can

474
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,880
cause

475
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,880
problems in in the implementations

476
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,640
because it is

477
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,400
a bit awkward what we are sending if you

478
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
are coming from webrtc

479
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
and probably the second one is more

480
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,559
straightforward but it is just a matter

481
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,840
of day of the syntax of

482
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,320
the of of uh how the candidates are

483
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
encoded and not what is the information

484
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,480
is there or how it is handled

485
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,160
okay look i i i guess i you know i i uh

486
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,760
certainly i i'm understanding better now

487
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,799
what you're talking about makes sense

488
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,280
thank you i just i think like as you

489
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,120
start changing how existing libraries

490
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,640
process this stuff and things i mean

491
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,000
every one of these things my question is

492
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,480
going to be like why like why why why

493
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,960
would i mean it can't be bandwidth

494
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,480
saving that's not a good answer in this

495
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,919
case that could not possibly be the

496
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:06,960
answer

497
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,679
um so i i just would ask what's the you

498
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,200
know minimal set of changes of what

499
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,720
people have already implemented that

500
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
that need to be done for this

501
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,799
um and i think really i would i mean i

502
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,320
think when i read the draft i

503
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,200
i i really wonder why we're doing it in

504
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
the general direction

505
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,600
of the client generates the offer why

506
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,200
doesn't the server generate the offer

507
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,400
and the other way the answer all of

508
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,080
these patching problems that trickle ice

509
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,919
problems a ton of these problems go away

510
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,360
if you reverse the direction of that

511
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,640
right

512
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,799
uh yeah but as we are yeah but as we are

513
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,760
doing india's is typically the the idea

514
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,799
is the

515
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,880
the that the client is the one that

516
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,360
indicates the communication so

517
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,520
would initiate the client would initiate

518
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,760
an http post or something to create a

519
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,760
new resource but the resource would come

520
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,840
back along with the offer and then you'd

521
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,320
send back up the answer right um so of

522
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,760
course it's still the client that

523
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,280
initiates the transaction but it it puts

524
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,960
right now the hard part in dealing all

525
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,320
of this is matching up offers and

526
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,840
answers and you wouldn't have to do all

527
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,039
that because the browser would be

528
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,480
implementing it that side and that end

529
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,000
of it would make it much easier so i

530
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,679
mean and it would make these problems

531
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,360
all go away too right

532
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,919
um no because you you just need to send

533
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,720
the candidates the ice candidates so you

534
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,640
need to this is not

535
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,520
uh we could just chosen

536
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,200
basically be no trickle eyes at that

537
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,559
point right because

538
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,919
you the the offer would contain the one

539
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,120
ice light global ip or you know static

540
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,480
ip

541
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,919
yeah and the browser doesn't actually

542
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,240
need that's done you're done

543
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
no but you need to see now using that

544
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,080
you need to signal back the ice

545
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,600
candidates from the client to the

546
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,760
browser so this batch request is the

547
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,760
what it is

548
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,799
the

549
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,720
the candidates from the client that it

550
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,840
is received

551
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,039
that are

552
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,360
gathered from uh

553
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,799
let me let me put it this way why are

554
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,919
you doing trickle you just collect them

555
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,440
up in the browser and send them like not

556
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,840
trickle just send them all send send

557
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,960
send a fully formed stp answer

558
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,440
just to be able to do it faster because

559
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,520
for example in my machine it takes more

560
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,159
than 30 seconds of the ice candidates to

561
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,080
get there

562
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,840
this is ridiculous just time whatever

563
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,679
you get in the first whatever like the

564
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,919
first candidate you get is going to work

565
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,200
so

566
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,760
time out after like 150 milliseconds you

567
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,600
know after 200 milliseconds and send it

568
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,679
i mean like that's people don't wait 50

569
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,120
seconds for ice that's not how

570
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,840
implementations work i i i agree but i

571
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,880
mean

572
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,400
then

573
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,520
it was this was discussed a while ago

574
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,159
and also we we also need to to support

575
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,000
aerostars so this way

576
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,080
allows to both

577
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,159
ice restart and ice candidates and

578
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,240
trickle the candidates to be

579
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,840
to be

580
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,919
implemented

581
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,080
so

582
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,200
i'm not sure i mean

583
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,039
an implementation well an implementation

584
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,039
can really do what you are proposing i

585
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,799
mean just wait for all the candidates

586
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,120
and they can do this in the initial sdp

587
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,200
without having to wait for the

588
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,840
for the new historical candidates and do

589
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,000
not set the patch request so but this is

590
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,520
i think that this is a different

591
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,559
different

592
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,640
discussion this discussion that i wanted

593
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,120
to to trigger right now just about the

594
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,440
format about the the candidates

595
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,200
okay

596
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,880
you want to have a detailed conversation

597
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,039
about changing an abn f but we don't

598
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,640
understand why you need that and we

599
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,240
don't understand why the architecture

600
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,000
causes the need for that so it's it's

601
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,840
back to that usual conversation where

602
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,360
you have an implementation want to talk

603
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,200
to a man neat detail of the existing

604
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,640
implementation

605
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,720
without really hitting the requirements

606
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,320
or why why we need this or what we need

607
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,400
to change i mean that's and that's why

608
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,520
it's sort of hard to follow exactly

609
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,720
what's being posted is we don't

610
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,120
understand the meta issue okay the the

611
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,600
the only the the the change

612
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
is because we are using bundles so it

613
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,440
does not make sense

614
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,159
and to have to signal the candidates

615
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,159
okay you are saying it does not make

616
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,360
sense to send them an email yeah

617
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,880
why does that not make sense like what's

618
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,480
what's the requirements of driving and

619
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,600
look i'm not arguing against that i'm

620
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
perfectly fine

621
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,520
i don't understand like why we'd go and

622
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,720
change things we don't need to change

623
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,960
right

624
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,320
for example in the current

625
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,559
implementations uh

626
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,640
you don't have the mit

627
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,679
in the

628
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,720
in the in the api the wcc api you don't

629
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,600
have the mid so you have to

630
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,120
get the

631
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,600
to get the mid you have to get the

632
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,320
you have to get the transceiver and get

633
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,520
the mid also get the the audio type so

634
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,520
it's not much so yeah you just was

635
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,000
asking if it makes sense i mean i it

636
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,520
current implementation not working fine

637
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,760
with the first with the first system i

638
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,000
don't i again i don't under i'm asking a

639
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,480
question like why why do you

640
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,159
want to move the secession level from

641
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,000
the media level i'm not arguing for

642
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,679
against it in any way whatsoever but i

643
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,840
don't understand the connection of a w3c

644
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,200
api to

645
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,960
to what you just said

646
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,679
yeah i mean the idea is that we are

647
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,799
doing banding so it's uh

648
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,559
so we can just send the candidates at

649
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,520
the session level sdp supports

650
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,440
sending candidates in the session level

651
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,159
but this a zip fragment don't so the

652
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,480
idea is if we shoot the assistant

653
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,640
then the fragment will also support the

654
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,960
candidates in the session level or not

655
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,360
okay because the zp already supported so

656
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,679
it is just and it is uh

657
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,480
so

658
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,799
it is just an association in how the the

659
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,960
trickle the the sdp fragment works and

660
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,000
know how

661
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,720
a sdp with a with session level

662
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,320
candidates works

663
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,000
what's the advantages of doing that

664
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,760
i

665
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,480
probably will just prevent some

666
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,720
interoperability issues

667
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,080
ah it sounds more like it's going to

668
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,600
cause them to prevent them i mean i'm

669
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,960
all for preventing reducing

670
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,039
interoperability issues but i'm not

671
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,799
it seems the opposite

672
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,640
i mean i mean i find with by using it i

673
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,400
mean just was raising the question the

674
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,760
current implementation already working

675
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
fine with the first one so if

676
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,279
no one sees a reason to move to the

677
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,520
second one i find to leave it

678
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,799
as it is so just say

679
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,640
i don't expect i didn't expect it to be

680
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,720
so controversial but i mean i'm fine to

681
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,400
keep it as it did right now

682
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,640
i apologize i don't i i'm not sure it is

683
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,480
it might be it might be better that way

684
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,640
or not better that way it's just like

685
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,480
this it doesn't i don't

686
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,559
i mean i would be all for something that

687
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,320
reduced interoperability problems made

688
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,240
things simpler and easier right

689
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,960
um but which way this is on that is not

690
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,480
clear to me i'm not arguing it one way

691
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,840
or the other i'm just sort of saying

692
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,000
it's like this is not this is not going

693
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,480
as a as an explanation i understand and

694
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,799
understand what like how to you know how

695
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,200
to make this decision or or even really

696
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,159
what the impact of this changes are

697
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,760
fair enough calling can we um can we try

698
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,000
to take the list of the repo all right

699
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,440
thanks uh martin you're next

700
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,480
keep that um so

701
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,679
um

702
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,200
let's let's try to separate these things

703
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,400
out first thing is you don't get to

704
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,799
change the definition of what's in 8840

705
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,600
here

706
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,279
it looks like you're you're asking for

707
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,600
something that's fundamentally different

708
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,960
than what's different

709
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,720
so define something fundamentally

710
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,440
different and describe how it works and

711
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,960
move on i don't think there's anything

712
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,720
particularly complicated

713
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,960
um with what you're asking for but it's

714
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,159
not what's in

715
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,000
rfc 8840

716
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,720
so

717
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,279
from that perspective it's

718
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,360
if if you want to move things to if you

719
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,039
want to move candidates to the session

720
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,640
session level then

721
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,559
to find something that has candidates at

722
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,200
the session level i think that's the the

723
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
sensible approach for that

724
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
the other thing was um

725
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,919
with with ice restart the way that

726
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,399
webrtc generally works is you have a

727
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,200
complete offer answer exchange

728
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
uh and it seems

729
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,720
to me like

730
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,799
you could do the same here

731
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,240
quite reasonably if you've got the

732
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,720
ability to to run another offer answer

733
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,279
in the same session

734
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,720
and if you don't

735
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,840
then

736
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,439
again define a new format

737
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,799
but yeah yeah again uh

738
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,840
foreign you don't really need a new zp

739
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,240
answer offer you just need to generate a

740
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,039
new username fragment and username

741
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,880
password so that is the only thing that

742
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,480
it is required

743
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,000
uh obviously you in in sdp in webrtc we

744
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,159
are generating a full offer answer but

745
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,760
it is not because

746
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,000
we and it is mandated

747
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,559
to do an http offer answer again you

748
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,080
just need to date the username and

749
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,840
password

750
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,039
that's a

751
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,240
also this is

752
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,159
something that it is already available

753
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,919
in svc 8840 so it is saying this the

754
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,080
mechanism is playing in there

755
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,120
and you just need to patch the both the

756
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,360
offer and the answer with this

757
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,320
with this new information and just to a

758
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,640
new sdp of transfer answer locally but

759
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,480
you don't really need to to do any

760
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,840
change to the

761
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,279
to the all the

762
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,200
or or media layer

763
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
so why do you want that that's

764
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,440
understood uh i'm just i'm just talking

765
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,279
about ensuring that things

766
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,080
are

767
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,399
consistent with with other systems and

768
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,240
just and having you justify those things

769
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,880
i think you have justified them but um

770
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,679
don't use 8840

771
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,720
uh

772
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,360
point at 88.40 for all of the behavior

773
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,480
but

774
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,799
you can't use the format

775
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,039
and updating it is just not no

776
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,279
i mean i mean if if we use the same

777
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,799
format on an 88 for a40 why we can use

778
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,799
it

779
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,880
it's not the same format

780
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,360
well if we use the same format

781
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,200
yeah i mean if we use the same format

782
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,640
because what i'm proposing is to change

783
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,399
it but what is in the graph is exactly

784
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,039
the same format

785
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,520
okay i'm i'm

786
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,039
i'm not understanding you at all sorry

787
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,520
coming

788
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,880
clearer

789
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,840
is it the same format or is it not

790
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,159
currently it is the same format

791
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,399
what i was proposing is if we should

792
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,480
change it but currently what it is in

793
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,799
the draft it's using the exact rpc 8840

794
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,799
format

795
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,720
right i understood that but what are you

796
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,240
proposing to change

797
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,159
what do you use or 8840

798
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,600
and

799
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,360
that i know i'm not sorry i i'm not

800
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,000
answering getting the questions here so

801
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,720
you you could change what you're using

802
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,799
to define a new format

803
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,840
or you could change the definition of

804
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,799
stp frag in

805
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,960
8840

806
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,919
i'm saying that you should not do

807
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,080
you should not attempt attempt to update

808
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,600
8840 you should define a new format

809
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,519
because otherwise

810
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,720
well it's not going to be 88 40.

811
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,960
okay so that's but anyway that's clear

812
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,960
and i think that we just

813
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,760
and

814
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,080
what if we don't do nothing then this is

815
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,720
it i mean because what we did already in

816
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,519
the

817
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,440
the current draft is using

818
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,640
rpc 8040 as it is without any changes at

819
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,600
all so the question is is if we should

820
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,760
change it and but it seems that there is

821
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,159
that the answer is no so we just can

822
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,559
stick to what it is in there and and we

823
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,640
will be fine

824
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,080
just a second

825
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,519
i'm gonna just jump in ahead of tim here

826
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,360
okay i just really apologize but i think

827
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,120
martin are sort of saying the same thing

828
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,039
which is there's two paths and we're not

829
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,600
arguing which one you should take

830
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,399
um

831
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,000
you could use 8840 exactly like it is

832
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,320
or you could have a different session

833
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,919
level syntax which may be the right

834
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,760
thing to do but if you do that you need

835
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,760
to define something that's not advanced

836
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,519
you can specify

837
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,799
neither of us is arguing which one of

838
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,720
those paths is best we're just saying

839
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,679
you need

840
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,240
those are the two paths in front of you

841
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,159
yeah sure i mean and i understand and i

842
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,880
think that it is easier to just ask for

843
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,519
us to keep to 88 40 and not do any

844
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,399
change and just say

845
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,519
and

846
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,000
well it does have been overhead but it

847
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,679
is understood and everyone will

848
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,120
implement it i mean

849
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,719
that's not such a big issue

850
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,279
hmm

851
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,720
you can hear like every other word very

852
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,960
low

853
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,120
so

854
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,480
am i in the care still yes i am

855
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,440
oh i can hear you go ahead

856
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,760
okay cool uh i just wanted to say i

857
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,679
think the stp fragment's the wrong

858
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,120
answer to this we've got a bit of

859
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,120
experience of um

860
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,159
of doing this kind of thing and

861
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,159
actually it turns out to be much easier

862
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,080
to send something that looks quite like

863
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,120
a diff

864
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,519
and and then synthesize the offer answer

865
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,360
out of that um

866
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,320
i

867
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,960
i just don't i mean sdp fragments the

868
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,960
wrong answer and and the reason we're

869
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,399
struggling with it is because it's the

870
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,600
wrong answer

871
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,919
uh we should be we should be cooking up

872
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,480
our own format and whether it maybe it

873
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,159
should look a bit like it but actually i

874
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,279
think it should be

875
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,799
quite different it should

876
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,320
look more like what everybody else does

877
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,559
with patch

878
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,240
so i just wanted to respond to some of

879
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,919
the things that cullen was saying he was

880
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,519
raising some uh sort of fundamental

881
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,960
architectural issues

882
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,640
and the key point that i want to make is

883
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,519
that the presence of trickle ice in in

884
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,480
wish

885
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,039
isn't some like accidental relic that

886
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,200
arises from the way that we're like

887
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,800
deciding to send the offer from one

888
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,320
direction or the other it's a

889
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,480
requirement of the system in order to

890
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,239
get broadcasts up and running as quickly

891
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,760
as possible

892
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,239
so making changes that

893
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,000
obviate this question by removing

894
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,560
trickle from the solution makes it

895
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,000
unsuitable for at least our purposes

896
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,000
so i don't know if i'm in the

897
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,679
if i'm in the queue

898
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,679
it wasn't clear to me you are in the

899
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,918
kitchen

900
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,839
so the first point is that i entirely

901
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,320
agree with that so if you live in the

902
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,239
luxury of a network in which there is no

903
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,918
turn servers trickle ice seems like a

904
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,918
useless complication

905
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,400
if like me you have to suffer through

906
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,960
networks that do require turn

907
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,160
then if you're trying to probe all turns

908
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,880
all turn servers before you even attempt

909
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,040
to send an offer it's going to give a

910
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,760
bad user experience um the second point

911
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,960
i want to make is a little bit

912
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,440
orthogonal i think that the distinction

913
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,560
between an ice candidate and an i3 start

914
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,040
should happen

915
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,720
120 layers above

916
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,400
parsing of sdp

917
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,119
i want to know i'm the server and i want

918
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,720
to know whether the client is doing a

919
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,560
nice restart or sending me a nice

920
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,839
candidate

921
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,040
straight away i want it at the http the

922
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,160
http layer i don't see why

923
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,320
we are refusing to put either a url

924
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,200
parameter or an http header

925
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,920
that tells the server explicitly

926
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,599
whether we're doing a nice restart or

927
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,359
sending a nice candidate

928
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,680
that is a simple solution the client

929
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,680
already knows whether what it's doing so

930
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,400
it might as well signal it explicitly at

931
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,920
the frame and

932
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,040
layer

933
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,200
and it will make debugging easier it

934
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,040
will make implementation easier i just

935
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,640
don't understand why people are opposed

936
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,680
to that

937
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,839
thank you

938
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,520
i mean currently we are using the same

939
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,079
request for both theatrical the

940
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,680
triglyceride start because

941
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,960
the the the db fragmenting c840 allows

942
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,880
to do that in the same

943
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,280
in the same

944
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,160
in the same request so this the

945
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,280
the

946
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,359
first question is if we should do

947
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,599
something different they has to

948
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,800
signal that

949
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,400
the

950
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,800
the client is just sending an uh

951
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,320
attribute lice or a restart

952
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,400
but i think that it is also

953
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,720
has to be with a

954
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,400
how do we handle a

955
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,760
out of order

956
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,240
a pass request because

957
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,920
obviously we don't want to the client to

958
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,040
do kind of any kind of blocking for any

959
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,640
http request

960
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,640
hey has been a response has been

961
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,400
receiving before issuing a new one

962
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,760
because for example

963
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,640
if you are doing a a nice restart

964
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,599
because

965
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,560
you have a network change probably then

966
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,200
you have some previous http http post

967
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,720
that will never be

968
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,079
uh

969
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,200
best be

970
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,119
the answer or will be you will have to

971
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,359
wait for the timeout for it to be

972
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,880
received

973
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,599
so then the question is how to deal with

974
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,480
this out of a of the folder

975
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,599
uh requests on the server side

976
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,440
and we have two different cases one if

977
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,720
we receive first a nice candidate

978
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,720
we send a nice candidate and then a nice

979
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,680
restart but we receive it in the in the

980
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,839
other way in the other order so we

981
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,760
received first the restart and then the

982
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,480
ice candidate

983
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,359
these new candidates should these all

984
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,760
candidates must be

985
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,520
must be discarded

986
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,400
but

987
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,480
how do we know that it is a an old

988
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,359
candidate and not a a

989
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,880
new i say

990
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,119
i restart

991
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,760
and then the other one is that

992
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,160
if it is an address or natural stand and

993
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,320
then as a nice candidate

994
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,079
and with and you receive

995
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,280
the the ice candidate for that it is

996
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,200
still valid but you have not yet

997
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,359
yet done the ice restart

998
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,400
uh should the ice will start

999
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,079
we cannot discard the as the ice kind

1000
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,920
yet because it may

1001
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,800
prevent the connectivity to be completed

1002
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,640
and if this ice candidate will also

1003
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,839
trigger a nice restart anyway

1004
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,400
um

1005
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,200
so

1006
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,760
yes it doesn't solve all

1007
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,359
issues

1008
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,200
the fact of having this one bit of

1009
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,119
information so martin is suggesting

1010
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,640
using different content types that's

1011
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,200
fine with me but having very early in

1012
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,359
your server the information whether this

1013
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,560
is the ice restart or whether it is a

1014
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,880
nice candidate doesn't cost anything to

1015
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,200
the client makes the life of the server

1016
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,400
much simpler

1017
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,520
and especially makes debugging of issues

1018
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,440
much simpler and so i think that's

1019
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,839
something very cheap that make things

1020
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:22,800
better

1021
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,560
and i think we should add that

1022
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,320
and i agree with you it does not solve

1023
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,839
all possible problems

1024
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,680
the

1025
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,480
the

1026
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,280
now how to differentiate an a normal say

1027
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,599
ice candidate or the

1028
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,400
or

1029
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,160
or

1030
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,880
electrical password for a trickle lice

1031
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,800
candidate or a nice restart can be done

1032
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,920
if a

1033
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,760
by checking the the the

1034
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,280
if we are doing it on the server

1035
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,040
checking that the client effect and if

1036
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,839
it is not

1037
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,960
um and

1038
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,560
then it is a nice restart so it is

1039
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,320
something that can be done easily the

1040
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,400
only thing is what happened if with this

1041
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,640
uh out of order request

1042
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,000
because

1043
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,200
we either have to mandate the

1044
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,880
the server to keep a small list of the

1045
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,440
previous username of fredward to detect

1046
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,560
a

1047
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,119
previous previously used

1048
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,839
username fragments to discard

1049
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,800
to to detect this of order request

1050
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,480
or if we should have just put a patch or

1051
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,839
a timestamp

1052
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,839
on the request to

1053
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,319
to make sure that when they

1054
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,880
it to to so they take the

1055
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,599
the server can know if the

1056
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,000
if the

1057
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,520
if the client either request has been

1058
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,720
out of order or not

1059
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,359
adam

1060
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,119
um i know it's sort of orthogonal to the

1061
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,200
issue that the julius is raising but in

1062
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,520
terms of ensuring ordering uh martin has

1063
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,960
pointed something out in the chat that

1064
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,160
i'm a little embarrassed and occurred to

1065
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,960
me earlier we have a mechanism in hdp to

1066
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,560
ensure this kind of ordering already we

1067
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,160
have conditional

1068
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,280
operations using e-tags and i think that

1069
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,160
would be a much cleaner way to handle

1070
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,839
ensuring that you're not putting state

1071
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,760
on top of stale state we're not putting

1072
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,079
stale state on top of existing state for

1073
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,440
these sorts of cases instead of doing

1074
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,520
something like a sequence number

1075
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,319
yeah i assume that that http has some

1076
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,599
kind of way to prevent it but

1077
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,040
i didn't want it to put it in the drop

1078
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,200
because it may be wrong so if martin if

1079
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,359
you could send me the information about

1080
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,680
where to look at sally i could try to to

1081
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,160
propose something to the list

1082
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,000
yeah i can send that to you okay

1083
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,359
so and the last

1084
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,240
the last bit change in the in the

1085
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,839
in the draft was to provide the

1086
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,480
the

1087
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,079
turn server

1088
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,160
the tool server configuration back to

1089
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,800
the to the client from the from the

1090
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,880
from the server

1091
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,280
what we have proposed is to just

1092
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,119
to map the

1093
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,400
information for example that it is

1094
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,839
currently in the

1095
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,359
in the wc apis to a link here

1096
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,319
that just as the in the url

1097
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:25,440
the

1098
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,599
the username the the credential and the

1099
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,440
credential type that is this is exactly

1100
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,359
the same definition that we are doing in

1101
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,119
the in the daily then the wc

1102
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,920
w3c apis to for

1103
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,839
for this options

1104
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,800
and then yeah i put the uh rel type of i

1105
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,079
server so we can check in the client

1106
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,520
which say

1107
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,280
which

1108
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,480
that this

1109
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,880
link is for the iserver configuration

1110
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,319
there is a typo here because the first

1111
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,319
one is two one should also have the the

1112
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,720
rel attribute

1113
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,290
and

1114
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,839
[Music]

1115
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,440
marking why is not a valid

1116
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,480
avalanche

1117
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,680
format this is just me quibbling uh

1118
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,920
you've got colons instead of equal signs

1119
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,079
and you forgot your ankle brackets

1120
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,000
uh but i was going to say this is this

1121
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,760
is a reasonable thing to do

1122
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:24,720
okay

1123
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,240
i will double check the format i mean it

1124
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,160
was just an example but

1125
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,399
okay so sorry for getting it wrong

1126
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,200
and a one thing that we have currently

1127
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,319
is that a

1128
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,520
um

1129
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,599
the both the webrtc and the rtc web

1130
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,440
offices and apis allows to update

1131
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,680
the the configuration and the ice the

1132
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,200
the tool server and understood server

1133
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,480
configuration

1134
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,640
before the the

1135
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,359
the

1136
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,599
gathering phase has has been started

1137
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,920
that will be before putting the

1138
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,560
or setting the remote description

1139
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,280
so

1140
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,440
and but we thought that the

1141
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,319
implementation will not allow to do that

1142
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,599
so we have and said that

1143
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,760
either this information can be sent in

1144
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,640
an options way on an option request

1145
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,280
today resource or your to the endpoint

1146
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,760
url or in the both in the http post

1147
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,319
response

1148
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,440
but we have seen that both the majors

1149
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,040
one that the implementation then the

1150
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,760
elimination all and the process supports

1151
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,359
it correctly

1152
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,400
so

1153
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,319
maybe we can just remove the the

1154
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,280
this

1155
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,200
retrieval of information in the options

1156
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,480
request

1157
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,839
just because

1158
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,280
for example

1159
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,839
if you are using an external provider

1160
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,560
and you are

1161
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,119
for example i am using twilio

1162
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,000
i will have to make two requests

1163
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,119
for each

1164
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,839
when only one is needed

1165
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,560
so maybe it's a if it is not really

1166
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,960
needed i i would prefer to remove the

1167
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,839
this

1168
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,760
and the configuration to be returning

1169
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,960
the options

1170
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,040
in the devtools request and only have

1171
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,319
the options for four cores

1172
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,520
yeah i don't know if i can chime in

1173
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,839
already that was in cuba sorry yeah just

1174
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:28,720
to

1175
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,720
just to mention that's uh i mean yeah

1176
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,400
you say that just remember as apache in

1177
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,160
the works but actually the issue there

1178
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,920
is that for instance my

1179
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,920
my web client is currently based on g

1180
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,680
streamer and g streamer doesn't allow

1181
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,839
you to do that update which is why in my

1182
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,240
current implementation i only have to

1183
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,640
rely i have to rely on options to to get

1184
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,960
that working actually and so the problem

1185
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,359
is that even if you get a patching g

1186
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,520
streamer today just rumor has its own

1187
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,920
development cycle and that can take a

1188
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,400
long time before it actually lands in

1189
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,880
all the major distributions that are

1190
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,640
available out of notes to everybody

1191
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,160
which means that even if it's ready

1192
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,480
today it may only be available to most

1193
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,880
people that are interested in this in

1194
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,800
one year or two years or something like

1195
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,280
this so this is just really from a

1196
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,000
practical perspective it may make sense

1197
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,839
to at least for

1198
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,680
the people that are interested in using

1199
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,040
g stream or it may be other

1200
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,280
implementations i mean i don't know

1201
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,440
to keep options at least as as an

1202
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,040
available option and i don't know

1203
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,880
whether it should be a master shoot that

1204
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,359
may or whatever it's just to basically

1205
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:35,759
allow this option to to be available

1206
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,079
i mean i find also with that because

1207
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,079
anyway what we are restricting is that

1208
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,240
the the options

1209
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,160
must be authenticated

1210
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,720
so to be able to to do

1211
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,160
the

1212
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,319
to to retrieve the the tool server

1213
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:53,599
configuration

1214
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,720
so if you are not doing the

1215
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,200
if you don't really need it

1216
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,040
uh

1217
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,720
then you will not provide it what we can

1218
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,760
do is just

1219
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,079
that the options do the

1220
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,960
doing the options and returning the

1221
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,359
configuration not the option is like

1222
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,800
kind of optional

1223
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,800
and but in the post it is mandatory

1224
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,160
meaning that you cannot descend

1225
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,240
certainly in the option so

1226
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,160
probably so

1227
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,839
if you support conf doing the

1228
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,680
configuration in the

1229
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,760
when you receive the post request you

1230
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,760
avoid doing the the first software

1231
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,839
request to to prevent the server to have

1232
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,759
to to fetch the credential twice

1233
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:36,960
check we've got about 15 minutes left i

1234
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,079
just want to make sure that people are

1235
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:39,839
keeping it concise so we can

1236
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:40,880
try to get us

1237
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,240
as much the right presentations as

1238
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,959
possible thanks

1239
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,280
so i'm

1240
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,480
in favor of keeping this

1241
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,000
in options

1242
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,400
because i think otherwise you aren't you

1243
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,800
effectively mandating tricholites as

1244
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,160
well

1245
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,240
because you wouldn't get a stun result

1246
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,680
because you didn't have a stun service

1247
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,720
set

1248
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,800
so your initial

1249
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,400
offer wouldn't have

1250
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,119
any candidates other than the

1251
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,680
uh locally discovered addresses in them

1252
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,599
and so you're kind of

1253
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,839
you know if you take it take this out of

1254
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,599
options then you're forcing triple ice

1255
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,760
on everybody and so you're radically

1256
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,520
complicating

1257
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:28,440
some of the stupider clients like mine

1258
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,280
um

1259
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,839
yeah i'm sorry uh it was unmuting um so

1260
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,319
i wanted to give a plus one lorenzo said

1261
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,280
and add on that the bigger problem is

1262
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,400
probably not the g streamer release

1263
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,400
schedule as much as browser release

1264
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,720
schedules right now you need to have

1265
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,160
this information before you start your

1266
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,680
initial

1267
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,599
peer connection to get the candidates

1268
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,040
that you're going to put into the offer

1269
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,119
in the first place so i think

1270
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,960
while i proposed options as being

1271
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,160
something transitional i think it's

1272
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,839
going to be a very long transitional

1273
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:06,800
phase

1274
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,200
that we can't like allied at this point

1275
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,240
um

1276
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,240
it's and for that reason i don't think

1277
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,280
you can

1278
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,200
make it optional in options i think this

1279
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,359
needs to be there at least for a fairly

1280
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,040
long time i mean maybe we can come back

1281
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,960
and revisit this for five years in the

1282
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,680
future and like deprecate

1283
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,000
that um the

1284
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,760
it's the final point on that that i want

1285
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,960
to make is um whenever you see an

1286
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,960
options like this you're pretty much

1287
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,400
guaranteed that there's a post coming

1288
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,440
along

1289
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,000
and it seems to me that the the server

1290
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,440
should just be able to cast the

1291
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,800
credentials for

1292
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,359
what is a very short period of time

1293
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,160
and avoid having this this

1294
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,079
double access to try to get the the

1295
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,599
credentials a second time i think this

1296
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,440
is something that can be fairly easily

1297
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,960
optimized in the server itself

1298
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,480
well i'm

1299
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,839
well anyway we can keep it and

1300
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,920
yeah i'm fine to keep it

1301
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,640
can we move to the next light

1302
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,879
so

1303
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,920
so

1304
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,319
the method you can present faster the

1305
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,800
results from the hackathon because we

1306
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,880
have only half 10 minutes left and not

1307
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,839
sure if we will have time for the

1308
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,440
for the rest yeah sure

1309
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,760
i don't know if teachers wanted to

1310
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,520
to shift the agenda a bit because

1311
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,040
there's limited time otherwise i can

1312
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,280
definitely present the diactor results

1313
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,880
quickly

1314
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,319
to show the hackathon results we did

1315
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,599
have two other presentations about

1316
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,240
implementation experience so i'm hoping

1317
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,559
you can modulate as much as you can to

1318
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,960
go quick so that we can try to at least

1319
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,440
touch on both sets of presentations

1320
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,599
yeah i'll try to do it as quickly as

1321
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:44,880
possible so

1322
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,720
i pre-loaded these slides by the way so

1323
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,960
if you want i can just grab these slides

1324
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,599
and control them myself

1325
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,720
but i think you need to

1326
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,640
release the the current slide deck first

1327
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,640
thanks

1328
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,520
yeah just so just to be quick this is a

1329
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,760
very brief overview of what we ended up

1330
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,680
doing in the hackathon week before the

1331
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,119
itf started

1332
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,520
and basically the main objective was not

1333
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,079
really just testing with by itself but

1334
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,240
it also was a very good opportunity for

1335
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,800
us to to test different webrtc stacks

1336
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,079
with each other because most of the

1337
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,720
times we use libwebrtc one way or the

1338
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,240
other and instead in this case we had

1339
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,480
several clients and servers talking

1340
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,240
using very different stacks instead and

1341
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,400
so this was a unique opportunity to have

1342
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,000
a

1343
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,319
heated debt as well and we actually did

1344
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,160
a few a first interrupt round a few

1345
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,400
weeks ago that involved me

1346
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,960
sergio julius and gustavo garcia as well

1347
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,720
and that was quite successful and ended

1348
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,720
up providing a lot of feedback for zero

1349
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,119
one and in this case we ended up having

1350
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,960
some more implementations to test so

1351
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,800
there was mine that is based on janus

1352
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,040
this was julius based on galen sergio

1353
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,720
integrated this in millicast and then

1354
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,200
there was a new sfu based on pion that's

1355
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,760
that supported this and multiple clients

1356
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,680
that could actually be taken advantage

1357
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,359
for the purpose again using different

1358
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:21,839
stocks like iu rtc pi on

1359
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,839
the the stock that team implemented for

1360
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,240
raspberry pi's and so on and so forth

1361
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,559
and let's say the end result was pretty

1362
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,200
much successful mostly successful

1363
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,640
more successful than this slide might

1364
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,240
suggest basically the grain means

1365
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,240
everything worked out of the box

1366
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,040
yellow means uh some things needed to be

1367
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,720
changed in the implementation on either

1368
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,079
side to get something

1369
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,640
working and orange and red instead meant

1370
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,480
different issues that happened that

1371
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,359
basically prevented a successful setup

1372
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,119
at the time being which may or may not

1373
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,960
be related to whip itself though in some

1374
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,240
cases it was related to uh for instance

1375
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,480
the different stock implementations or

1376
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,920
different stock implementations unable

1377
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,599
to work with each other or even just

1378
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,839
different codecs because for instance

1379
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,559
some endpoints are not coded to send vp8

1380
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,319
and that is a fuel for instance only

1381
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:11,040
supports h.264 for ingestion which means

1382
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,480
that in that case

1383
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,040
that's the reason why the uh

1384
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,880
the the interrupt test didn't work which

1385
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,520
isn't really a fault in in whip but just

1386
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,559
basically

1387
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,960
the negotiation ended up closing there

1388
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,200
were a few issues uh as i mentioned

1389
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,599
related to the to the webrtc stacks that

1390
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,839
needed to be fixed in some cases it was

1391
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,440
just basically

1392
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,599
some basic firewall problems and so on

1393
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,119
and so on and so forth so i wouldn't

1394
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,880
really bother you with the details about

1395
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,400
all these you can just have a look at

1396
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,920
these lights for that

1397
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,599
what i really want to stress out was

1398
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,680
that this first interrupt test was

1399
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,359
mostly focused on the basics so we

1400
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,359
really just wanted to make sure that a

1401
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:49,839
web client could basically do a

1402
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,520
handshake with a web server and get

1403
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,440
something working so a webrtc stream

1404
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,440
that could be consumed somehow and

1405
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,200
basically ensuring that audio and video

1406
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,359
would work across these different

1407
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,079
implementations and that does sound

1408
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,119
that did basically uh sound like a good

1409
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:07,280
starting point for us and what we really

1410
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,720
want to do next though is basically

1411
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,800
start looking a bit more in-depth at

1412
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,400
other functionality for instance we've

1413
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,079
spent a lot of time now talking about

1414
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,960
ice restarts and how to actually trickle

1415
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,720
candidates and so on and so forth that's

1416
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,559
not something that we have

1417
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,119
tackled tackled so far some more issues

1418
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,760
related to possibly or front sessions if

1419
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,839
you don't do an http delete for instance

1420
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,440
whether or not the server is able to

1421
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,440
detect stuff automatically we've

1422
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,640
mentioned the

1423
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,960
uh the link support for stun internal

1424
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,799
auto configuration so whether or not

1425
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,280
post versus options can cause issues

1426
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,319
anything related to bearer tokens and

1427
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:45,119
and stuff like this so and this was the

1428
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,559
interrupt testing team so it was

1429
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,880
basically six of us working working

1430
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,760
together uh during past week and i don't

1431
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,200
know if you have any

1432
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,440
quick question for us at this specific

1433
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,680
point or if you're satisfied with this

1434
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,640
very quick overview

1435
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:03,680
i have to leave it as as we're good and

1436
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,280
they should take questions to the list

1437
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,839
or to get up either way um and i'd like

1438
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:10,640
to um kind of arbitrarily pick julius to

1439
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,880
go next um i know it's another problem

1440
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,799
we've got minutes but uh we can jump

1441
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,640
hopefully we can do it kind of quickly

1442
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,640
uh or at least get we got because we

1443
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,319
have at least two there was going to be

1444
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,799
a third s um uh

1445
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,640
you know a couple seconds about um

1446
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,920
implementation experience but people

1447
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,680
should feel free to uh comment on the

1448
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,599
mailing list i did post the slide so

1449
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:33,280
that's good julie is very good

1450
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:35,520
i can present your slides for you

1451
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,000
thank you

1452
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:41,440
so i've got three minutes right

1453
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,880
hi i'm julius crobach next slide you

1454
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,480
have about five

1455
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,839
okay next slide please

1456
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:59,440
okay so galen is a webrtc sfu which i

1457
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,839
implemented during the first french

1458
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:03,359
lockdown it has some properties that are

1459
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,599
that are cool and the development was

1460
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,680
partially supported by mexi next please

1461
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:12,799
and uh

1462
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,960
at some point dave told me about which i

1463
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,040
implemented weapon galen

1464
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,799
and the main and unlike the other unlike

1465
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,240
some of the other implementations the

1466
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,400
first class implementation it's actually

1467
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,400
part of the server i'm not attempting to

1468
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,559
translate into galen's native signaling

1469
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,839
protocol next please

1470
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:34,559
and

1471
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,680
so

1472
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,760
the good news

1473
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,400
is that whip works and it's easy to

1474
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,040
implement i did it in one night

1475
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,760
there's 427 lines of code that are

1476
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,280
specific to whip

1477
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,200
there's 50 lines of patches to galen's

1478
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,680
core but that's galen's fault because

1479
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,559
i'm not exporting enough of the english

1480
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:57,839
the internal data structures and i had

1481
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:00,319
help i had a client and that was

1482
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:02,880
laurenta mignero's simple web client

1483
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,440
next please

1484
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,160
so it's five shell commands if you need

1485
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,880
a server to test your web client against

1486
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,440
it's literally five commands to get it

1487
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,400
running next please

1488
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,760
okay

1489
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,160
and uh so that was the good news i had

1490
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,000
some minor difficulties and the main

1491
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,599
reason for that is that i'm not

1492
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:26,880
competent

1493
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,640
and that means that i'm a precious

1494
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,040
resource because i'm currently the only

1495
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,200
incompetent whip implementer

1496
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,079
but if whip becomes successful

1497
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,240
then i will no longer be the only

1498
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,640
incompetent web implementer hopefully

1499
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,799
and so we must aim the draft its

1500
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:44,640
incompetence and i had mainly four

1501
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,480
difficulties this were course url

1502
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,480
multiplexing authentication and

1503
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,400
distributions what i mentioned already

1504
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,880
candidates from restarts next please

1505
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,200
lorenzo explained course to me i knew

1506
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,960
nothing about cars i had vaguely heard

1507
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,000
about it

1508
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,720
and asking lorenzo for help is something

1509
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,880
that doesn't scale so i think that the

1510
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,119
draft should explain course or at least

1511
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,400
do the link next please

1512
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:13,520
um

1513
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,640
so the other difficulty is that in galen

1514
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,720
we want to have a very simple user

1515
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,640
interface we have just one url both for

1516
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,319
the native javascript client and the

1517
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,960
with request and so i would really like

1518
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,760
if wood could mandate that there is a

1519
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,440
url parameter

1520
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,160
that

1521
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,559
mentions that this is a whip request so

1522
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,559
that we don't have to give multiple urls

1523
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:38,160
to clients next please

1524
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,640
okay authorization we've been through

1525
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,640
that already i won't bore you

1526
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,200
with it anymore but i would like to see

1527
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,319
http basic nice restarts we've mentioned

1528
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:51,280
it already

1529
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,480
next please

1530
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,160
okay so

1531
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,559
in conclusion it's one night and 500

1532
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,720
lines of code and thanks a lot to

1533
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,279
everyone who

1534
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,200
i'm helped pretty impressive thank you

1535
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,400
for condensing that into four minutes um

1536
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,319
i i guess my point about uh the

1537
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:11,760
implementation experience is it really

1538
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,520
does help us as chairs move things

1539
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,920
forward so if we really only have a few

1540
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,240
things less that we need to uh kind of

1541
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,200
agree upon that really makes uh makes me

1542
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,880
feel really great because i did i did

1543
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,920
think that this wasn't going to take

1544
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,240
forever um but again i'm hoping that we

1545
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,760
can take everything else the list and i

1546
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,920
do want to apologize for the others who

1547
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,680
made uh

1548
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,520
um please uh check them out in the

1549
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,160
github repo and the data tracker um the

1550
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,920
one final thing i think i want to check

1551
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,240
on the list is at what point do we need

1552
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,599
to go to other working groups that we

1553
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,359
said with liaise with to

1554
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:45,040
you know make sure we get an early

1555
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,640
review that we're not on the wrong path

1556
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,680
because i would hate for the

1557
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,160
implementations to get out in the wild

1558
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,520
and

1559
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,720
get corrected later

1560
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,720
nationally i think that is it and we'll

1561
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,559
have to thank you for your time and

1562
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,440
let's take everything off the list

1563
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,720
you
