12
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,520
still not enough time we have to decline

13

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,319
there were some

36
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,879

45
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,800
that's nfc 8179

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800

50
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,920
and unless

51
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,800

56
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,920
protection

57
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,599

and

60
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,959
we would like them to focus on

61
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,519
explaining what changed and why they

62
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,040
think their documents should progress

63
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,200
new work is

64
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,159
related to satellite communication

65
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,480
as well as cloud through optical

66
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,120
problems and cloud network integration

67
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,280
and ppr

68
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,720
as part of a

69
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,439
larger

70
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,000
focus we are going to have hpcc plus

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,480
plus presentation which is talking about

72
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,159
high precision control

73
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,400
needed in

74
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,840
large data center networks

75
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,478
potentially applicable to routing to go

76
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,680
forward and then since bbt doesn't meet

77
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,279
we've got presentation on signal

78
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,479
degradation from this

79
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,840
we've got the rfc 1967 published which

80
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,639
is fundamental for bgp and model and

81
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,320
actually all routing not models in ikea

82
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,000
it's really serious milestone

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,400
congratulations to the authors

84
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,120
and ideas

85
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,960
we didn't adopt any documents

86
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
in terms of existing documents we've got

87
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,320
qs model

88
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,240
and it's uh

89
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,440

90
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,000

about the behaviors of a mirror axis

173
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,399
and they use ayanna signed a value 74

174

in addition we made a few

176
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,040
editorial changes

177
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,680
next page

178
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,920
the behavior of a mirror seeds is

179
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,200
similar to the behavior of

180
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,959
independent seeds

181
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,120
for the calculation

182
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,680
and the specific ipv6

183
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,319
for the table lookup

184
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,440
the middle seats

185
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,640
must be the last segment

186
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,519
in

187
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,200
sr pass

188
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,240
and it must be associated with the

189
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,959
iphix

190
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,440
forwarding table

191
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,279
when node

192
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,880
determines that

193
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,399
the designation address of a package

194
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,760
is its local mirror sees

195
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,040
this node

196
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,279
will execute

197
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,200
the behavior of a mirror sheet

198
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,120
so this node

199
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,320
basically

200
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,720
will

201
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,640
decapitulate the package

202
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,720
through removing

203
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,440
the outer ip56 header

204
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,279
and then

205
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,360
forwarding the payload

206
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,040
of the package

207
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,560
using

208
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,440
the

209
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,519
forwarding table associated with this

210
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,079
mirror sheet to distribute the payload

211
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,399
to the package so this is very simple

212
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,920
and is already

213
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,680
well defined for the underdog

214
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,680
dt6c

215
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,600
so next page

216
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,160
next page

217
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,160
so could you hear me do you move to

218
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,480
likes page

219
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,399
but it seems like the screen sharing is

220
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,399
lost

221
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,279
please share

222
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,320
doesn't the next page just say

223
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,480
solicit new work or something like that

224
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,760
i mean can't you just talk over it

225
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,200
the the press enters the screen by

226
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,760
himself

227
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,519
comments are welcome and we would like

228
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,399
to

229
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,240
ask for working group in high school

230
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,320
that's all the slides you have

231
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,680
yes yes that's all the last lines

232
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,920
yeah

233
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,920
uh greg you have a question

234
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,399
go ahead

235
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,399
and my question is um

236
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,680
related to the work that being um

237
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,360
discussed uh in spring on a compressed

238
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,399
um

239
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,839
service six

240
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,480
side

241
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,360
so uh

242
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,880
because there's

243
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,839
not yet uh final

244
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,240
uh decision well there is a decision to

245
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,160
adopt um

246
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,399
cc proposal

247
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,079
um

248
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,639
so but it's just the beginning of the

249
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,839
work

250
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,120
um i think that it would be good if uh

251
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,760
this document um

252
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,880
at least discusses how it's related to

253
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,400
the

254
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,440
[Music]

255
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,680
services

256
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,239
compression

257
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,760
yeah i think this is a

258
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,279
question for every extension

259
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,680
for the for the seed right

260
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,600
so for comparisons

261
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,920
i think this is a

262
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,120
comparison

263
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,480
i think

264
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,880
not every document about the seed to

265
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,199
so you possible can write something

266
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,040
about the comparison

267
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,480
but i think that one is general

268
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,760
for every

269
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,199
extension

270
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,720
regarding to

271
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,639
this kind of a segment sees right

272
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,160
uh yes i agree it's probably

273
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,120
more broad but

274
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,519
especially since uh authors of this

275
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,279
document consider

276
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,920
asking for the working group last call i

277
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,320
think it will be good to have

278
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,040
the compressed srv6 sid

279
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,839
uh already considered and addressed in

280
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,720
this document rather than

281
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,800
have another document

282
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,359
that would

283
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,000
address

284
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,040
their

285
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,279
egress protection with the compressed

286
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,760
service exit

287
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,199
but again it's for the working group to

288
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,320
decide

289
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,480
thank you

290
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,880
ac go ahead

291
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,680
uh ac linda my cisco systems

292
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,120
uh given we have some uh documents

293
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,079
for encoding of srv6 we have one uh

294
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,440
that is

295
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,680
even further along than this and i'm not

296
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,000
i don't i would be really against

297
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
holding them until the whole

298
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,800
uh compressed sid uh

299
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,360
thing is um is sorted out

300
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,399
i mean we can't we can't wait for that

301
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,560
it's not like we're gonna have

302
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,279
compressed sid uh

303
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,880
architecture

304
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,079
approved

305
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,319
in the next before the next ietf

306
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,120
that's all i have to say

307
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,199
laura you have something to say

308
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,399
that's the

309
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,519
an answer to ac i think

310
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,120
what would be good was that when we

311
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,320
start working with through class call we

312
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,079
actually point at the compressed draft

313
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,839
and say that there is a relationship

314
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,880
that we will do ahead anyway

315
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,440
it's fine with me i just don't think we

316
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,000
should hold up any work unless it's on

317
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,160
sid compression for the com

318
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,639
agreed upon sid uh

319
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,399
compress in architecture from spring

320
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,639
i agree

321
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,480
wrong

322
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,240
for a lower i guess

323
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,160
if you point at the compressed side

324
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,679
aren't you pointing at an unstable

325
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,679
reference

326
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,319
i i took i took uh lois comment to me

327
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,480
you point at it in an email not as a

328
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,440
normative reference in any of the base

329
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,640
uh srv6 drafts or drafts as they go

330
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,080
forward

331
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,480
yeah i said that as part of the email

332
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,320
that starts the

333
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,240
working replace call

334
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,000
just tell people

335
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,360
it's like a downrev you need to notify

336
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,240
people but then

337
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,960
it shouldn't hold up the working group

338
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,200
last call

339
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,080
so for all the protection related draft

340
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,919
we will need to work with these

341
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,240
spreadsheets on the topic anyway so

342
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,400
we'll sync up with them and update the

343
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,280
one days

344
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,000
any other questions

345
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,720
okay so the x

346
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,720
presenter

347
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,400
okay thank you very much thank you

348
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,960
everyone for the comments

349
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,520
lower i suppose you're in the queue by

350
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,000
mistake

351
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,559
lee you are the next one

352
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,280
then are you there

353
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,360
so seems like we are missing a presenter

354
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,360
um

355
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,799
yeah there's some problems with audi

356
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,120
took me five minutes to join

357
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,480
um

358
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,880
some build and the original number four

359
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,679
are you there yeah

360
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,720
um do you want to do

361
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,880
the slideshare yourself or you want me

362
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,240
to do it

363
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,400
could you please share the slides for me

364
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,360
[Music]

365
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,960
yes go ahead

366
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,240
oh okay

367
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,400
this contribution is from

368
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,120
china mobile and huawei technology and

369
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,919
i'm sure you're from china mobile and i

370
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,320
will give a presentation on advertising

371
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,880
cloud via optional network problem

372
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,919
statement

373
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,520
network page please

374
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,039
so

375
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,919
this the first page is talking about the

376
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,159
motivation of this work

377
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,960
so you know as we know

378
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,000
as a cloud-based application are growing

379
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,760
in popularity

380
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,600
data center and the data center

381
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,360
interconnection are becoming

382
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,760
increasingly important

383
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,720
for example finance financial services

384
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,600
need a low latency high reliability

385
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,520
government you already need a lot of

386
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,080
bandwidth high security matching

387
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,960
services you'll need a lot bandwidth

388
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,080
high reliability and the internet

389
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,799
companies usually need large bandwidth

390
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,320
and low licenses

391
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,320
services

392
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,400
so

393
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,520
the

394
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,840
uh in order to

395
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,159
meet this this demand

396
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,840
uh

397
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,039
data center international network

398
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,240
are keeping migrating

399
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,600
tradition traditionally people

400
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,480
access the claude usually by using ip

401
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,039
networks

402
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:43,440
alternatively we believe accessing cloud

403
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,640
with optical networks is increasingly

404
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,600
attractive at the and become an option

405
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,640
for

406
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,280
for user to access cloud

407
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,120
because

408
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,320
optical

409
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,360
transport work is based is basically

410
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,280
based on

411
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,880
on tdm and time division multiplicing

412
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,000
mechanism so it don't have

413
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,280
it doesn't have the uh

414
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,240
the turing problem and the time perfect

415
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
avoid

416
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,600
package congestion

417
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,120
next page please

418
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,480
sorry i can't

419
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,039
i can't see the

420
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,520
page now

421
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,840
it did

422
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,600
move so you should see use case one

423
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,120
multi-cloud access

424
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,320
okay

425
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,880
okay i see now thank you and uh i will

426
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,679
give several use case for

427
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,480
accessing cloud using option networks

428
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,720
the first

429
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,080
use case is multi-cloud sizing

430
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,960
we know that cloud services are usually

431
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,520
supported by multiple

432
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,720
interconnected data centers

433
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,360
which are usually basic within one

434
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,320
region

435
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,280
space the facing

436
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,120
uh usually 100 kilometer in order to

437
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,720
provide active to active or

438
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,280
virtual machine services

439
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,799
with uh within this kind of distance

440
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,080
so

441
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,679
so data uh send this central service uh

442
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,480
yuri uh demand uh require on demand and

443
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,520
the stability high reliability and the

444
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,279
user

445
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,240
based building et cetera this kind of

446
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,320
requirement

447
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,279
so therefore the the network to

448
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,520
interconnect the data center also

449
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,640
require

450
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,320
require the height

451
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,720
capacity and the low latency high

452
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,760
reliability and the flat scheduling this

453
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,320
kind of functionality

454
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,760
and we believe

455
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,080
this advanced optical transport network

456
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,799
is

457
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,559
its idea for

458
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,440
the dci applications

459
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,080
for example we can use

460
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,120
otl networks with vpn to

461
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,520
to connect multiple

462
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,960
uh cloud

463
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,880
clouds together and

464
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,400
we we have

465
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,799
we have we have the odu

466
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,000
k

467
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,960
uh

468
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,159
channel uh in between to connect the

469
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,600
this kind of clause and uh uh

470
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,159
perhaps we have smart measurement under

471
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,960
control systems for

472
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,320
uh for traffic perception

473
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,039
some kind of idea like this

474
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,799
and let's page

475
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,799
please

476
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,720
okay the second use case is high quality

477
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,520
at least a lot uh high quality private

478
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,760
land can provide a lot bandwidth low

479
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,400
latency high security and reliability

480
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,200
actually

481
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,039
operator

482
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,000
with

483
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,080
optional network

484
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,039
optional networks

485
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,600
operator with optional network can

486
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,640
provide

487
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,600
a customer with this kind of high

488
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,919
quality private lab

489
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,279
which can

490
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,960
which can enable

491
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,080
a user to move for eyesight to close

492
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,480
sides

493
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,880
by doing by doing that

494
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,120
we can

495
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,279
accelerate the deployment of cloud

496
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,760
service and reduce the capacity and the

497
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,279
opaques

498
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,400
and next page please

499
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,240
thus the third use case is a cloud

500
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,880
virtual reality

501
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,240
and we know that the user experience of

502
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,480
virtual reality

503
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,320
likely depends on the local dedicated

504
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
hardware

505
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,159
which can

506
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,120
do

507
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,559
rendering

508
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,760
under

509
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,960
something like that and uh if we

510
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,400
move the

511
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,039
the rendering function from local

512
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,200
hardware to cloud side we can

513
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,760
improve the user

514
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,440
experience and

515
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,640
reduce the

516
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,400
cost

517
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,600
but

518
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,159
this is a high requirement for the

519
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,640
interconnection between user side and

520
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,640
cloud

521
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,159
we think uh optical networks is a idea

522
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,080
approach to

523
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,279
connect the user and the clause

524
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,480
for the claude virtual reality

525
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,760
for example it can provide

526
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,279
a large and sometimes flexible bandwidth

527
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,279
for example from mega uh um for example

528
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,159
from tens of mega

529
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,720
bits per second to one gigabit per

530
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,080
second and the low latency for example

531
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,799
smaller than 10 milliseconds and the

532
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,480
lower uh jitter for example smaller than

533
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,520
five milliseconds

534
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:34,880
on the

535
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,240
next page please

536
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,200
so uh this page summarize the

537
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,840
requirement for accessing

538
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,440
to a cloud

539
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,200
optional networks

540
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,000
so optical networks with

541
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
vpn can provide the capability of

542
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,760
multiple to multiple

543
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,360
cloud access

544
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,159
and

545
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,080
actually some otn equipment has adopted

546
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,360
the patient processing functions such as

547
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,480
packet switching npr's vpn

548
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,240
et cetera already

549
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,159
and also the second is a high

550
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,880
performance and high reliability

551
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,360
the third is

552
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,960
small granule

553
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,200
larity and container

554
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,799
and it can be tuned flexibly

555
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,880
from two

556
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
mega to

557
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,440
one gigabit per second

558
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,240
and this can improve the efficiency of

559
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,520
the network

560
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,360
and also uh option network can provide a

561
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,279
lot bandwidth low latency and the

562
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,880
logiter

563
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,600
so the last page of

564
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,320
definition thank you another last page

565
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
is the the

566
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,760
next time next step and our plan

567
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,600
we see

568
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,840
for previous work

569
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,679
in using

570
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,279
rtgwg

571
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,520
related to this draft first of all it's

572
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,039
a night night to cloud gap analysis the

573
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,399
second night to cloud problem statement

574
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,840
we think

575
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,919
the content in this draft is

576
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,000
complementary to the

577
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,760
about to draft so we call for entry

578
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,120
so

579
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
we call for interest and

580
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,799
contribution

581
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,039
and

582
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,039
i will stop here for a question and

583
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,520
comment thank you

584
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,279
thank you for the presentation and

585
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,000
before we start questions when do you

586
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,120
say

587
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,520
move forward together do you expect some

588
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,559
kind of merch or just informal exchange

589
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,600
of information what are your intentions

590
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,440
here

591
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,559
um

592
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,240
and to my understanding so first i think

593
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,720
we should uh evaluate

594
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,080
the

595
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,000
common

596
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,720
ground of

597
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,159
my

598
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,720
my proposal under the

599
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,360
previous work and uh so as you're

600
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,600
stretching maybe we can it's time to

601
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,919
previous work and merge something into

602
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,399
it that

603
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,600
sounds great deborah

604
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,879
w unmute

605
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,000
debra we can't hear you unmute

606
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,000
do you hear me now

607
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,200
yeah great it seems always have to do

608
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,480
about

609
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,960
three different mics okay

610
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,799
just quick uh because i

611
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,360
noted this is also being presented uh

612
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,440
tomorrow in ccamp

613
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,559
i just would like to say that i think

614
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:23,039
this is really a c camp uh document

615
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,799
as it is addressing otn

616
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,039
requirements um

617
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,200
and i would just like to say vpn work

618
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,360
was addressed in

619
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,000
c camp quite a while ago 2005

620
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,840
so if any

621
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,039
gaps

622
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,240
are needed they can address that

623
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,799
but they'd have done layer 1 vpns

624
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,480
already

625
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,919
and there's even a another draft rfc on

626
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,480
rfc i should say

627
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,519
4974 which

628
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,039
even adds more sophistication to that

629
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,159
and as far as the requirements on

630
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,600
lower switching granularity for otn

631
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,880
that's not an ietf uh discussion that

632
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,919
should be done in study group 15 who

633
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,840
holds the rights to otn technology

634
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,080
and it is quite an active discussion

635
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,120
there

636
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,559
so the if you need

637
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,679
um requirements on lower granularity you

638
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,960
should be going to study group 15. okay

639
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,880
and then to tomorrow for further

640
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,159
discussion thank you

641
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,519
okay

642
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,559
should i

643
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,760
and

644
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,559
thank you for your very good question

645
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,760
and uh

646
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,640
for the your first

647
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,880
part of your question

648
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,760
i think that we could

649
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:57,840
just evaluate for example the gmpr's

650
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,840
need to be

651
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,399
adapted or changed to

652
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,559
meet the new

653
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,440
new requirement for the

654
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,559
uh accessing

655
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,320
cloth

656
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,399
with optical network

657
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,159
for example multiple material multiple

658
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,760
claws so

659
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,200
maybe i think there's some work to do

660
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,240
in this regard

661
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,960
and

662
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,559
i just agree that

663
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,200
osu

664
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,039
related

665
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:33,919
what

666
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,039
is mean

667
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,960
they

668
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,840
we should be mainly finished

669
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,960
at ut

670
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,840
sg

671
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,159
15 yeah yes that's my idea maybe my

672
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:46,960
my

673
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,080
my toy

674
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,399
homie can't give some

675
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,719
his idea

676
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,240
people on the cube are really really

677
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,240
tight on time so unless your question is

678
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,399
very short into the business please take

679
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,039
it to the list

680
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,039
i'm very happy to see the draft because

681
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,719
you know we just post similar drafts in

682
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,760
ipv6 later one years ago

683
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,918
so i'm very happy to see that and we

684
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,639
hope to uh have more discussion with you

685
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,599
uh the co-orders and let's see how to

686
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,359
move the world together in the future

687
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,599
thank you

688
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,040
thank you great thank you here we are

689
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,119
going to close the queue and move to the

690
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,679
next presenter please uh excuse me

691
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,760
charles coming from

692
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,320
actually i i would like to have a short

693
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,239
question to the working group because we

694
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,599
see the two

695
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,480
existing uh working group document has

696
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,119
been expiring for a while so we are

697
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,399
curious about the reason and to check

698
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,399
who is working group if we still have a

699
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,280
chance to to integrate what has been

700
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,359
done in this document to the existing

701
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,960
one as a

702
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,280
chair suggested we we can merge some of

703
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,119
our common requirements and work on

704
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,640
separate solutions

705
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,960
suggested by by debra in different

706
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,880
working groups

707
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,040
aldebaran suggested this work probably

708
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,520
belong in c camp and we'll discuss it

709
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,839
with c cam chairs

710
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,400
and we'll update you we we really have

711
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,760
to move we're over time

712
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,760
thank you

713
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,079
thank you

714
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
next presenter

715
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
so can you hear me uh this is the link i

716
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,640
just missed the last

717
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,839
call from insane i don't know

718
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,800
we can we can we can hear you yeah okay

719
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,760
great so uh should i share my screen or

720
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,240
just use yeah you can do the share

721
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,510
screen like we practiced

722
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,680
[Music]

723
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,160
thank you

724
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,920
engine we still see all sides we need to

725
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,920
unsure

726
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,680
this is a

727
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,760
oh hold on

728
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,000
being started

729
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,520
yes we can see our slice yes great great

730
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,880
great and something should go into

731
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,800
presentation mode

732
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,480
okay

733
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,400
so go ahead hello everyone uh this is uh

734
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
my presentation is about satellite

735
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,680
network

736
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,720
uh it is a quite new area and the

737
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,480
satellite network is a complete

738
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,920
different just uh

739
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,839
networking uh on ground so it's a

740
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,359
quite complicated

741
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,880
and

742
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,280
my presentation has a two uh

743
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,760
draft so far one is about problem and

744
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,960
statement another is about proposal to

745
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,760
use semantic address for satellite

746
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,079
of course it's not complete solution

747
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,160
it's just a

748
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,960
tiny step to propose to use semantic

749
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,000
address to improve the

750
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,079
id routing in the future

751
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,400
and i have presented this first uh draft

752
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,680
in the inter area before i invest its

753
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,720
this time i want to bring it to a

754
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,960
logging group since i think the routine

755
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,520
is one of the most challenging issue in

756
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,720
cell life networking

757
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,480
so as a whole objective uh this tried uh

758
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,520
try to solve the uh

759
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,040
routing and switching issue for

760
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,800
large-scale satellite concentration

761
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,920
network for internet access

762
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,079
with a shorter latency and the global

763
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,200
coverage

764
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,280
and the right hand is a picture for the

765
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,320
uh starlink phase one satellite network

766
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,920
if you can see the how big is the

767
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,839
network it has over 4000 satellites

768
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,680
and right now it

769
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,079
launched more than 1500

770
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,160
so

771
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,599
this kind of consternation is

772
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,520
made from the new altitude satellites

773
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,000
500 to

774
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,839
2000 kilometers

775
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,680
and normally it

776
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,040
has a

777
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,680
couple of thousand or over even 10 000

778
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,359
satellites

779
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,800
and into satellite link will be used to

780
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,560
connect satellites

781
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,800
even right now the even starlink

782
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,160
has not started yet it only does it in

783
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,079
some experimental

784
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,240
and the satellite it will be integrated

785
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,960
with many ground stations by microwave

786
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,480
on desert

787
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,920
and there are two types of ground

788
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,599
station ones called the gateway ground

789
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,680
station it can relay the

790
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,920
traffic from satellites to another

791
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,040
satellite

792
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,920
and also the ground gateway grants the

793
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,680
ground station is connected to internet

794
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,160
that's why we can access the internet

795
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,320
through the satellite network

796
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,760
and uh

797
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,520
from this scale a lot

798
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,599
of networking will more have more than

799
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,320
even more than 10 000 grand station on

800
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,839
earth

801
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,400
and another type of uh ground station is

802
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,240
called terminal ground station if you

803
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,400
are direct connect to user terminal uh

804
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,119
just like our wi-fi

805
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,640
router and it may be

806
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,119
able to do really as well as suggest by

807
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,680
starlink

808
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,520
so this is example of a styling

809
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,200
plan for their

810
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,720
satellite network

811
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,520
for the uh phase one it has uh

812
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,560
four shears a shear of the satellite uh

813
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,839
constellation is uh defined by uh same

814
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,920
uh the satellites with the same altitude

815
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,680
and same

816
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,799
inclination angle

817
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,000
so what is the problem of this satellite

818
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,160
constellation and

819
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,320
satellite constellation is very dynamic

820
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,320
but we are ordered

821
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,920
every satellite position is keep

822
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,040
changing at the speed of the

823
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,359
first cosmic

824
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,839
speed or more than seven

825
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,079
kilometers per second

826
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,280
and but the satellite's orbit will be

827
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,839
constant

828
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,720
with the such dynamics we can see the

829
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,839
satellite network topology keep changing

830
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,440
link state cost change very frequently

831
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,400
for example link cost if we use the

832
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,880
satellite distance as selling cost then

833
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,880
it will keep changing

834
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,880
and the uh

835
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,240
cellulite ground station link it'll also

836
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,800
keep changing because the uh

837
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,560
reachability issue

838
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,119
and the it will have an interruption

839
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,440
every two to three minutes uh for 450

840
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,520
kilometers altitude

841
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,400
and the links between satellites and for

842
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,520
the cell launch latitude and

843
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,960
direction links it is steady because the

844
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,440
relative position is not changing but

845
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,000
for the links on the longitude direction

846
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,640
it will be unsteady at the polar area i

847
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,160
will show you later

848
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,400
and it will have we will have a two

849
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,640
interruption every cycle for the

850
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,920
satellites for this kind of altitude the

851
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,000
every one and the six uh 1.6 hours

852
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,319
satellite removal a circle

853
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,800
on earth

854
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,359
and also the links with satellites

855
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,200
moving in opposite direction

856
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,800
unfortunately even with the same

857
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,520
altitude the satellites adjacent

858
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,520
satellite may move in into opposite

859
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,800
direction

860
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,560
and for this kind of link we will

861
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,480
interrupt every three to four minutes

862
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,160
all these calculations in my first draft

863
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,319
and for vertical link

864
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,400
with a different altitude then it

865
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,880
depends on the altitude difference and

866
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,760
the inclination angle

867
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,319
so as a summary cell life position is a

868
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,440
critical a predictable by a mass but not

869
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,560
the links

870
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,960
because the link ground for example

871
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,119
links between uh ground station to

872
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,520
satellite its quality will be impacted

873
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,319
by weather and obstacles

874
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,480
and the links between satellites also

875
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,960
impact by uh tracking technology because

876
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,839
the

877
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,640
they will use a laser to check the pier

878
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,000
and

879
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,160
definitely not be hundred percent

880
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,200
succeed

881
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,359
and also the distance is changing and

882
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,040
position

883
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,880
so uh we can

884
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,520
see that the the traditional distributed

885
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,119
igp bgp mps model is hard to use

886
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,400
why because

887
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,960
we will have a convergence issue for two

888
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,680
frequently changed technology and we

889
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,520
will have a constant control data

890
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,960
flooding issue

891
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,800
because of the

892
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,079
new topology and also overhead of

893
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,319
control protocol message for

894
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,680
previous

895
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,920
in the satellite link bandwidth because

896
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,079
from the current technology we can only

897
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,839
have about 10 gig

898
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,440
for the up to 2000 kilometers distance

899
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,079
so how about the centralized sd model

900
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,160
because master itf meeting some people

901
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,079
said this there's no problem for this

902
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,119
stem can solve it but we can see it's uh

903
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,680
it's uh it's impossible because

904
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,000
we will see where is the controller then

905
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,240
because we have so many satellites which

906
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,319
one is a controller satellite

907
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,240
and what is the basic connectivity

908
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,400
between controller to all satellites

909
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,880
we cannot have a constant connection

910
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,720
between every satellite to one ground

911
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,839
station

912
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,760
and how to guarantee the folding table

913
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,680
on all satellites

914
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,520
are synchronized

915
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,599
and how often the controller need to

916
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,280
update the

917
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,680
folding table all this issue is not

918
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,000
solved

919
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,319
the first draft i have update two

920
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,960
sections one sections

921
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,599
analyze the adjacent orbit with the same

922
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,280
altitude

923
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,160
in non-polar area and the polar area

924
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,480
then the another section uh i have a

925
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,640
detailed analysis for the

926
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,040
estimation of communication lifetime for

927
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,280
satellites on adjacent orbit with the

928
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,560
same altitude

929
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,000
moving on different direction

930
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,160
so this shows the

931
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,480
satellites on adjacent orbits even

932
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,800
adjacent orbits may move in the opposite

933
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,400
direction and

934
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
more complicated is that when adjusting

935
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,520
orbit moving to the polar area that have

936
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,160
a crossing

937
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,000
so as a whole the there are four type of

938
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,040
cellular links one is that one the two

939
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,599
non latitude direction link

940
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,400
it will be relatively steady but for the

941
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,400
other links or may be

942
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,599
interrupted

943
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,760
for period time for example link for

944
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,359
longitude direction

945
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,400
in only a steady at the non-polar area

946
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,760
at the polar area it may be interrupted

947
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,520
depending on the tracking technology i

948
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,960
wish you one

949
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,359
and unsteady link is that between

950
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,520
satellite even on adjacent orbit but

951
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,000
with a different moving direction then

952
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,119
their

953
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,520
distance will be changing faster and so

954
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,520
the lifetime of communication it will be

955
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,560
shorter

956
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,720
and the vertical links is between the

957
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,640
satellites on adjacent orbit with a

958
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,640
different altitude

959
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,560
that state depends on the difference of

960
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,720
altitude and inclination angle

961
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,480
so this is a situation when

962
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,240
links come to the polar area that's

963
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,079
before our crossing that's after

964
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,400
crossing we can see the facing of the

965
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,480
interstellar link will be swapped right

966
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,240
hand will be become the left hand

967
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,640
i will have a video clip at the end will

968
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,640
be easier to see

969
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,960
so new draft new draft is that to

970
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,480
propose to uh uh use a semantic uh ip

971
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,599
address

972
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,079
it will embed the orbit and other

973
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,400
information into the ip address so and

974
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,280
what to embed we have uh proposed the

975
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,119
five uh uh index owner share and orbit

976
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,359
plan index and seller index and the unit

977
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,680
interface index why we use interface

978
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,400
index because the satellite interface is

979
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,359
not like the lord in our own grounds

980
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,359
that can have many interface but in

981
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,839
satellites the the price is very

982
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,880
expensive and we we can only have a very

983
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,000
limited

984
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,920
number of index so we can embed

985
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,200
interface index into the address

986
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,760
then why we do this first benefit is

987
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,839
that we can make the

988
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,520
link identification

989
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,760
easier and faster we don't need to have

990
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,000
a satellite here to exchange the orbit

991
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,119
information

992
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,200
before we know if appear is kind of

993
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,680
steady or unsteady

994
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,520
and also it can make the symmetrical

995
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,920
routing and switch possible but this one

996
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,760
is not described in this

997
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,480
object it's not mature yet we will

998
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,079
describe update material

999
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,200
so how to use this semantic address we

1000
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,000
have proposed three ways one is id

1001
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,960
address

1002
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,599
embedded into the interface identifier

1003
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,680
and second is that

1004
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,640
embedding to the neat field but with a

1005
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,720
shorter lens

1006
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,040
third one is the usually does a variable

1007
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,839
lens ip address why we propose this

1008
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,400
because as i said the satellite link

1009
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,200
bandwidth is suit pressure uh directly

1010
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,559
use a 1 28 bit

1011
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,359
ipv6 interface uh maybe too much

1012
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:32,400
overhead

1013
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,599
if we have a shorter rk address such as

1014
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,520
48 bits or even 64 bits will be a

1015
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,880
benefit for the bandwidth

1016
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,640
so this is just a

1017
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,319
coding and

1018
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,240
this is a ipv6 embed into the interface

1019
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,280
identifier this is a neat field and of

1020
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,599
course it will have a shorter field for

1021
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,280
different index

1022
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,200
and this is uh

1023
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,200
directly used as a ip address but with

1024
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,480
shorter

1025
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,040
than one connect bits

1026
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,520
of course it will be only um we will

1027
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,839
decide the exact length after this

1028
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,960
variable length ipfs is accepted by the

1029
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,160
commun community

1030
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,160
uh here i show the examples of uh

1031
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,319
links by this uh

1032
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,400
semantic address uh

1033
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,359
how to distinguish different links and

1034
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,480
how to

1035
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,480
identify the step

1036
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,520
status

1037
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,079
for example if we see the uh

1038
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,640
peer which has the satellite index

1039
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,119
difference is one that means it's on the

1040
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,319
uh same orbit and its link it should be

1041
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:45,440
steady

1042
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,559
and if the link that we see the orbit

1043
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,280
plane index differences one

1044
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,880
and

1045
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,000
if it's my current position is at a

1046
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,240
non-power area the link issue should be

1047
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,200
steady

1048
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,800
but if it's in the in the orbit plane

1049
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,119
index difference is more than one then i

1050
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,680
will know that that my adjacent is is

1051
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,319
moving very fast uh the link may be not

1052
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:11,920
steady

1053
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,559
then for the vertical direction then the

1054
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,800
just check if the shear index difference

1055
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,880
is of one if a shear index difference

1056
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,119
one means that it's my adjacent

1057
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:21,839
uh

1058
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,160
orbit which has a different

1059
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,720
altitude

1060
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,599
uh next i will shoot quickly the uh

1061
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,200
clip

1062
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,079
to to visualize the

1063
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,400
dynamics of the satellite

1064
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,400
consolation

1065
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,040
can you hear the sound is the

1066
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,119
you can hear sounds right

1067
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,559
i can hear you

1068
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,760
i'm not sound from video

1069
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,240
no

1070
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,479
it doesn't come true very very low

1071
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,839
lean it's too low

1072
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,960
yes

1073
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,040
you you cannot hear

1074
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,480
no

1075
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,839
oh you cannot hear the sound from the

1076
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:27,280
video no

1077
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,720
oh sorry so probably uh i i just stopped

1078
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:35,040
here everyone can check by themselves

1079
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,280
yeah steven uh

1080
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,240
shared the url the email to the

1081
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,520
video link

1082
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,920
after the meeting so people can take a

1083
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,720
look

1084
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,640
yeah plus you know we only have five

1085
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,599
minutes

1086
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:52,839
left for

1087
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:56,400
questions nice

1088
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,160
start go ahead

1089
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,599
stuart you're on mute sorry it takes a

1090
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,119
couple of seconds to do all the

1091
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,800
microphone allowing

1092
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,680
so lynn at the very beginning of your um

1093
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,040
presentation

1094
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,880
you made an assertion that normal um

1095
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,040
link state style convergence normal

1096
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,319
routing conversions would not be

1097
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:25,839
adequate for this

1098
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,839
uh mark handley who's well known in this

1099
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,920
community did some simulations quite

1100
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,760
some years ago and these were real

1101
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,839
simulations on a gaming engine as i

1102
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,160
recall for the whole cluster and he

1103
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,319
concluded that it would work so i wonder

1104
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,000
if you could resolve this difference of

1105
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,640
opinion between whether classical

1106
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,400
ordinary techniques work or whether we

1107
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,960
need to do something special

1108
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,760
yeah sure yeah because uh just imagine

1109
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,160
if a network has a couple of thousands

1110
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,800
raw or nodes and

1111
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,760
many nodes will have a link interaction

1112
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,720
every

1113
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,240
couple of minutes

1114
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,400
and for this kind of network it will be

1115
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,760
very

1116
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,359
unstable in the uh in the ground

1117
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:08,720
well that's

1118
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,599
yeah you you may say that he actually

1119
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,400
simulated the starlink cluster the whole

1120
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,280
thing

1121
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,960
okay concluded it was yeah

1122
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,200
yeah i know his uh paper and i know his

1123
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,760
simulation it's a similar as i i used

1124
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,319
because this uh simulator software also

1125
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,960
from serve

1126
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,040
yeah

1127
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,720
i just think that before we make

1128
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,640
assertions that it's not possible sure

1129
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,119
we need to we need to be clear

1130
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,160
uh what the real parameters are and

1131
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,359
deal with that from position of

1132
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:48,880
knowledge

1133
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,280
and say mark was very convincing

1134
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,400
that he thought he could do it

1135
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,720
robin

1136
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,599
hobby

1137
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,440
but my question is that

1138
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,280
you this uh

1139
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,960
use the thematic

1140
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,400
address

1141
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,079
what will be the

1142
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,119
forwarding table

1143
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:22,160
the folding table is a is because for

1144
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,839
example if you're using uh us in ipv6 it

1145
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:26,880
will be

1146
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,520
same as for uh before but the problem is

1147
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,760
that should we use the folding table

1148
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,000
that's another question because uh

1149
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,760
as i said if we use a traditional

1150
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,280
technology of course we will use the

1151
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,920
forwarding table but if we

1152
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,520
we want to use some new technology you

1153
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,800
may not be able to use the folding table

1154
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,599
uh

1155
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,880
so because

1156
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,839
so that's either just my doubt so so i

1157
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:52,319
mean maybe not the forwarding table so i

1158
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:53,040
mean

1159
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,520
what will be the forwarding mechanism

1160
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,640
for this

1161
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,920
yes yes that's also i yeah i also want

1162
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,559
to have a community to to be

1163
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,480
aware of this challenge

1164
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,000
and uh if us still still was said the

1165
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,760
traditional technology works very well

1166
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,520
of course we were still using floating

1167
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,319
table but are very uh doubtful about

1168
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:18,000
that if we don't have uh we need may

1169
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,079
need some new technology to make this

1170
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:21,920
work perfect

1171
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,200
okay

1172
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,319
uh the second one i think this is the

1173
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:29,200
will be the research work or this is

1174
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,240
some of the uh working group work

1175
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,839
because this is uh

1176
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,480
actually i don't know right now so uh

1177
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,720
i want the community make the decision

1178
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,720
finally because i see some research

1179
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,079
work but

1180
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,640
think about right now the many companies

1181
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,680
already try to deploy this network so

1182
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,559
uh maybe they we need some solution

1183
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,599
quicker quickly to to to to provide to

1184
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,359
industry

1185
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,160
okay okay okay thanks

1186
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,558
thank you

1187
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,799
um hi um so a very quick point first is

1188
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:12,240
i think this is a man a problem and uh i

1189
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,319
think it's would probably

1190
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:17,119
uh experts in this area uh contribute to

1191
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,880
the money working group um this is a

1192
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,559
classic moving adjusting network the

1193
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,160
topology

1194
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,520
although the number of nodes within your

1195
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,920
network is fairly constant because it's

1196
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,720
there's

1197
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,480
new satellites do not get launched that

1198
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,240
often or they get launched at well-known

1199
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,200
periods

1200
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,480
the topology itself is in flux but it's

1201
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,640
influx in a fairly predictable manner so

1202
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,280
i think you can bound the problem

1203
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,760
and i agree with you that

1204
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,079
perhaps the approach of of some of the

1205
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,760
traditional link state protocols may not

1206
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,000
be right but i don't think you have to

1207
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,319
throw the forwarding

1208
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,240
the forwarding table concept away i mean

1209
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,920
it's a fairly

1210
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,240
basic concept on which we

1211
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,400
pin a lot of ip on the concept of a

1212
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,480
forwarding table and discarding that i

1213
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,040
think seems like a big step

1214
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:05,920
um

1215
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,119
i think you could add some um sort of

1216
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,640
contact information within the

1217
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,920
forwarding table to say at this moment

1218
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,760
your forwarding should be going this way

1219
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,000
and after this moment it should be going

1220
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,839
that way as as the contacts change

1221
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:21,520
between the satellites

1222
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,720
but still

1223
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,559
that is deterministic and can be

1224
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:27,359
predicted but anyway either way i think

1225
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:29,119
this would be a good topic to take to

1226
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,400
mani

1227
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,880
yeah thank you thank you uh comments but

1228
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,760
actually your idea we we we did uh think

1229
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,599
about that way but

1230
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:40,240
when we in con we still encounter that

1231
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,200
some unpredictable events for example uh

1232
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,880
some adjacency lost then uh distributed

1233
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,640
way may still not

1234
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,040
quick enough to to synchronize all that

1235
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,359
base but we can uh discuss offline

1236
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,359
because it's a very interesting topic

1237
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:56,960
yes thank you and that's why i think

1238
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,200
manet because uh i think a hybrid

1239
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,440
approach between understanding that it

1240
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,680
should be there and some detection of

1241
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,839
whether that contact is there or whether

1242
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,200
it's

1243
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,880
yeah yeah so but this is the sort of

1244
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,880
subject that many deals with

1245
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,040
thanks thank you

1246
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,200
lynn thanks for the presentation like to

1247
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,559
second

1248
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,200
and monet was focused on solving similar

1249
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,200
problems lower skills so

1250
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,760
and uh i would really like you to focus

1251
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,880
on trying to address stewart's comment

1252
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,440
they've been proposals they've been uh

1253
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,200
at least theoretical proof that things

1254
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,520
could work if you could review it and

1255
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,799
provide the information would be very

1256
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:37,040
valuable for the first discussion

1257
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,359
and thank you yeah thank you thank you

1258
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,839
everyone

1259
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,760
okay um can you hear me

1260
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,960
yeah

1261
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,319
okay

1262
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,119
thank you i am wondering here in here

1263
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:57,119
from china mobile

1264
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,160
so um on behalf of other authors i'm

1265
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,880
going to present this draft uh the cloud

1266
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,960
and network integration

1267
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,040
uh considerations

1268
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,400
so um ironic suggestions and discussions

1269
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,760
are welcome

1270
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,960
so i have to please

1271
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:19,359
so um the motivation of this

1272
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,680
contribution is first

1273
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,280
analyze a trend of the network and cloud

1274
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,680
into an integrations

1275
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,520
so um

1276
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,440
with the development of 5g and the

1277
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,240
internet first the convergency trend of

1278
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,599
cloud and network is increasingly

1279
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,440
so more and more services and

1280
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,440
applications will be carried on the

1281
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,280
cloud data centers

1282
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,440
in order to support new services and

1283
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,240
applications requirements

1284
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,720
and meet the security and

1285
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,720
also the delay requirements

1286
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,680
so the deployment location of the edge

1287
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,280
cloud data center is also lowered from

1288
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,359
uh the original

1289
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:03,040
disease

1290
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,319
so in order to avoid new construction of

1291
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:09,119
a huge cloud transport network uh we

1292
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,880
consider the exit existing metro network

1293
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,599
uh

1294
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:16,880
to use to access hdcs

1295
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,760
so for example in our company china

1296
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,040
mobile so we use a 5g backhoe transport

1297
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,240
network

1298
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,000
which is an iut mtn technology

1299
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,040
to

1300
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,200
access httc

1301
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,520
so the interconnection between the edge

1302
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,119
disease and the regional dc or the core

1303
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,520
disease is implemented through the

1304
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,640
coordination between the metro and the

1305
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,520
cloud transport network

1306
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,960
so therefore the access point of uh the

1307
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,520
enterprise entering the cloud is usually

1308
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,680
in the metro network

1309
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,760
and the dedicated line entering the

1310
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,079
cloud also involves the interconnection

1311
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,760
between the cloud and

1312
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,040
transport

1313
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,000
cloud transport and the metro network

1314
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,680
um i in this draft we describe the cloud

1315
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,480
and network integration scenarios

1316
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,480
and the networking technologies

1317
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,440
okay next please

1318
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,720
um

1319
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,000
for the

1320
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,040
net internet working scenarios uh there

1321
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,880
are only two

1322
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:25,920
uh

1323
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,040
scenarios uh the multiple domains so

1324
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,640
with all without the common border nodes

1325
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,920
okay next please

1326
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,160
so the first scenario is

1327
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,480
the magical domains with common border

1328
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,920
nodes

1329
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,880
on the right side it's a natural network

1330
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,480
and the left side

1331
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,880
is a cloud transport network

1332
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,799
so the boundary node of the cloud

1333
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,640
transport network

1334
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,280
also serves as a boundary node of the

1335
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,400
natural

1336
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,680
network

1337
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,720
um

1338
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,839
there are

1339
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:04,319
independent idp instances

1340
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:06,720
uh in macro and the cloud transport

1341
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:07,920
networks

1342
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,640
um if the skill of the metro

1343
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,319
network is large um it will be divided

1344
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:16,720
into multiple idps

1345
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,760
um

1346
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,160
and for the conspiration of the

1347
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,520
controllers

1348
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,559
they may have different controllers

1349
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:27,040
or under the same

1350
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,880
superior controller like the

1351
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,000
orchestrator also

1352
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,520
okay next please

1353
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:39,040
so the second scenario is the multiple

1354
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,400
domains with

1355
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,119
uh without the common border nodes

1356
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:46,960
also the also the uh right side is a

1357
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,280
cloud transport network and the left

1358
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,040
side is a macro transport network

1359
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,599
they do not have a common border nodes

1360
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:57,119
and

1361
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,000
the node border node of the

1362
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,359
two networks are connected by

1363
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,520
some direct links

1364
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,240
so at this scenario

1365
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,880
we need ebgp

1366
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,760
to deploy it between the two domains how

1367
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,799
to connect routers and all the transport

1368
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,160
devices

1369
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,760
of the two domains and we also need the

1370
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,680
hierarchy controllers

1371
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,640
uh

1372
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,319
in this scenario

1373
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:28,160
okay um

1374
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,119
so next please

1375
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,319
um so we can

1376
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,520
consider the technology

1377
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,559
for networking depending on

1378
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,119
whether the lateral domain

1379
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:46,839
support or does not support

1380
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:49,200
srv6 uh the first

1381
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,760
networking technology was a metro

1382
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,640
network uh does not support srv6

1383
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,440
so we need segment splicing of the

1384
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,760
different network technologies

1385
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,400
to use to achieve the

1386
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,079
end-to-end connection of services

1387
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:10,400
and for the

1388
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,200
second case is some nodes of the natural

1389
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:17,200
network support srv6

1390
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,079
and

1391
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:19,760
um in the case of

1392
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,839
the multiple domain with the common

1393
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,359
border nodes

1394
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:24,160
um

1395
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,920
which is um

1396
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:26,880
uh

1397
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,960
researched in the

1398
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,960
spring srv6 amps interworking draft

1399
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,799
it can be used to achieve the

1400
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,720
interworking

1401
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,440
well in the case of the multiple domain

1402
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,440
without

1403
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,200
common border nodes

1404
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,319
or other natural network scenarios

1405
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:48,160
such as

1406
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,799
a metro network support

1407
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:53,920
mstp or sr mpls

1408
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,480
ldp srp etc

1409
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,440
the solution um might need to be further

1410
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,359
discussed

1411
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:04,319
um so the third one is the natural

1412
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:07,520
networks to support eye services

1413
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,680
also in this case solutions for

1414
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,920
interworking between two service sex

1415
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,720
domains needs to be considered and

1416
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,960
including the centralized controller and

1417
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,400
the

1418
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,680
distributed control plan solution

1419
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,000
and how to implement the end-to-end

1420
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,640
traffic engineering et cetera

1421
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,319
also

1422
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:28,690
um

1423
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,799
[Music]

1424
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:33,680
and that's the piece

1425
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,440
um so um about uh is our considerations

1426
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,640
on the

1427
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,720
cloud and

1428
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,690
network integration scenarios and

1429
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:47,680
[Music]

1430
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,280
technologies

1431
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,280
so

1432
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,920
uh comments are welcome

1433
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,160
for us we are

1434
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,880
more focused on the case that

1435
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,440
uh the multiple domains with metro

1436
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,680
network and the

1437
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:04,559
uh

1438
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,480
cloud transport network

1439
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,880
with um

1440
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,599
not without a common border nodes so

1441
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:13,520
they connect it with

1442
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,280
some direct links

1443
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,200
uh that is uh

1444
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,960
also um

1445
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,680
real scenario in our operators networks

1446
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,400
and further techniques technologies

1447
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,440
should be

1448
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,359
will be

1449
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:32,480
considered more and

1450
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,880
hope to see

1451
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,720
some comments on that

1452
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,079
okay

1453
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:42,160
so thank you that's all

1454
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,399
thanks

1455
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,440
i mean it's really nice to to to

1456
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,920
hear the the topic again because you

1457
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,119
know

1458
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,839
we are working on this as well so so

1459
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,400
welcome to join the topic and hopefully

1460
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,680
we can uh

1461
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,920
have more cooperation in the future and

1462
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,960
as you know that we have post a draft

1463
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:11,039
last year uh about uh the uh network a

1464
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,880
cloud network inter

1465
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,160
creation recorded ipv6 based

1466
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,280
cloud oriented networking and released a

1467
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,319
list of

1468
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:22,799
the requirements and salute and

1469
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:25,440
associated solutions in the draft and i

1470
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,039
have post the link in the uh chat box

1471
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:30,480
and you can

1472
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,039
take a look and we can have more

1473
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:35,359
discussion apply to to take a look at

1474
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:38,880
how we can make uh cooperation uh

1475
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,799
further yeah

1476
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:44,000
okay when you say we do you mean the

1477
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,960
outers of the draft

1478
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,720
sorry jeff

1479
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,640
when you say we

1480
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,400
who do you mean the authors of the draft

1481
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,599
yeah that you published last year okay

1482
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,160
so please work together and see where

1483
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,359
they're turning

1484
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:03,839
yeah yeah sure because those jobs

1485
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:05,839
yeah because both drafts are i

1486
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:07,520
informational draft

1487
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,160
and the scenario scenarios and and use

1488
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,319
case are really similar maybe the same

1489
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:16,640
yep so so so let's work together yep

1490
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,279
okay thanks

1491
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:23,160
next presenter please

1492
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,200
stewart

1493
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:50,480
on me thank you

1494
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,400
i assume you don't have any questions i

1495
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,480
don't have any questions no

1496
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,440
okay

1497
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,440
so uh preferred path of routing uh

1498
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,880
next slide please

1499
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,760
right in in this talk i want to do two

1500
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,240
things i want to give a two slide

1501
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,440
reminders close revision of what ppr is

1502
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:16,080
and then i want to look at the use cases

1503
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,279
that we think ppr would be advantageous

1504
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:20,719
to uh

1505
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:22,560
to deploy in and then i'd like to

1506
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,560
encourage others to to work with this on

1507
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,560
this technology so next slide please

1508
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,359
so here's a quick overview ppl

1509
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,960
provides a method of injecting

1510
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:36,719
engineered paths into link state igps

1511
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,960
in the data plane the packet is mapped

1512
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,679
to its intended path by the ppr id

1513
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:47,120
the ppr id is a single identifier in the

1514
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,238
packet

1515
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:50,238
so just one

1516
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:51,600
address

1517
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,000
of whatever type the packet is using

1518
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,560
uh but it and it can support multiple

1519
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,600
data plane types so the ppr id can be an

1520
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,040
ipv6 address an ipv4 address

1521
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:06,640
an mpls label an mpls or an ipv6 sid or

1522
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,799
a mac address so we can apply it to any

1523
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:10,719
of these technologies it's not hemmed

1524
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:14,080
into just mpls or just ipv6

1525
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:17,520
so here's an example on the um

1526
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,000
on the left of a of a packet that's

1527
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,479
going abcd

1528
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:25,359
in the data plane the only thing that

1529
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:28,880
maps it to abcd is the ppr id

1530
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,799
and the path is described in the

1531
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,399
in the igp

1532
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,560
all right next slide please and there's

1533
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,479
a a a a a

1534
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:40,399
a draft that describes this uh for

1535
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:41,920
people who want to

1536
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,679
remember how it worked next slide please

1537
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,158
right thank you so uh it can we it can

1538
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:48,319
support quite a rich range of structures

1539
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:49,920
we can describe point-to-point we can

1540
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,158
describe multi-point to point and we can

1541
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:55,040
describe graphs within the control plane

1542
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,120
structures that were designed for this

1543
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,560
technology

1544
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,880
the ppr paths can be injected by a node

1545
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,880
for its own purposes so locally i can

1546
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,400
decide i want to do

1547
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,560
i want to construct a ppr path i just

1548
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,719
inject it into the

1549
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:12,159
into the igp like i would um any other

1550
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:13,760
lsp

1551
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:17,600
or it can be injected um by the uh

1552
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,120
it's through an s from an sdn controller

1553
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,040
and

1554
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,880
you can just create these paths right so

1555
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,640
but what what it really does what the

1556
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,280
really important characteristic of it is

1557
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,520
that it enables engineered parts in

1558
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,640
cost-sensitive network applications so

1559
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,560
think cheap hardware the cheapest

1560
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,239
hardware you can imagine

1561
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:40,320
think small overhead because packet

1562
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,320
overhead is a problem and think a sim

1563
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,480
relatively simple operational model

1564
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,760
and we have an open source

1565
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,360
implementation of this that was

1566
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,280
demonstrated so

1567
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:52,080
some while ago at ietf 105.

1568
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,960
so next night please

1569
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,679
next slide please

1570
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:00,880
so here's some use cases all right so

1571
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,159
here is a um a mobile backhaul

1572
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,320
a mobile crosshall and the thing we're

1573
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,480
interested in is in those little purple

1574
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:09,679
circles

1575
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:10,800
and

1576
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,600
they are where we need to provide cheap

1577
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,120
connectivity

1578
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,520
and at the moment they're provided by a

1579
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,199
number of technologies

1580
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:20,480
layer 2

1581
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:24,840
uh ipv4 mpls ipv6

1582
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,199
underlays um

1583
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,120
it is by no means a world that's gone

1584
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,239
entirely to uh to ipv6 and not

1585
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,560
necessarily even to mpls next slide

1586
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,800
please

1587
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:38,840
so let's drill down a

1588
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,960
bit um

1589
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,120
here we have what one of those uh

1590
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,600
circles that little little pink or uh

1591
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,760
mohs circles look like all right it's

1592
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,280
actually got structure and it's got

1593
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,000
structure in which we have to do

1594
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,560
traffic engineering it's usually a set

1595
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,640
of large subscent subtended rings of

1596
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,640
various sizes

1597
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,719
on this structure we need to provide

1598
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:01,920
slicing

1599
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:02,960
because

1600
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,600
this is the world that slicing was was

1601
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,679
created to serve

1602
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,760
but we also need to apply things like

1603
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,360
and that's nicely we'll need strict

1604
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,480
piles and it will need traffic

1605
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,440
engineering we also need to provide

1606
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,120
fast traffic aware

1607
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,719
traffic engineering aware fast reroute

1608
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:20,880
in this environment

1609
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,679
um so you know think

1610
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:25,920
how do we do this for the minimum amount

1611
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,719
of money on the cheapest hardware much

1612
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,120
of which is actually already deployed

1613
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,960
and will cost a lot of money to change

1614
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,440
next slide please

1615
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:38,000
a stewart while your country i think ac

1616
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,239
asked for purification

1617
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:43,360
sorry go guide go ahead

1618
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,920
how would you contrast this to a binding

1619
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,440
set

1620
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,280
we're going to talk about that

1621
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,520
wait wait uh you you can use it to

1622
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,280
create binding system let's let's get

1623
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:59,440
there in a moment and i'm not a plant

1624
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:01,840
right so uh but we will get to binding

1625
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,520
seats right so um these spine networks

1626
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,760
sorry look think about the edge of the

1627
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,159
the network right um in the edge of the

1628
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:12,480
network we're gonna have to put some

1629
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,280
some mini micro data centers right uh

1630
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,360
because the trend is to get these

1631
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,280
computes out as close to the user as

1632
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,800
possible to save bandwidth and to

1633
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,640
improve latency

1634
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,640
so these tend to be leaf spine edge

1635
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,360
fabrics these are not massively scalable

1636
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,679
data centers these are small systems

1637
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:33,040
they use an igp and they've got an ipv4

1638
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,199
data plane in many cases they will need

1639
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:37,440
to reproduce to support traffic

1640
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,199
prioritization and they will need to

1641
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:40,239
support

1642
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:42,800
redundancy and granular park level oam

1643
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,080
next slide please

1644
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,920
uh fast reroute right so we discussed

1645
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,159
this a little while ago uh the the

1646
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,320
interesting diagram on here is the

1647
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,080
purple the purple line which is a

1648
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,320
traffic engineered path

1649
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,120
and um what we need to do is to traffic

1650
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,159
engineer the um

1651
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:04,480
the the backup for that path and we

1652
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,400
don't want to wait uh for end-to-end

1653
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,320
recovery because that takes too long we

1654
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:12,080
lose too much traffic um we

1655
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,320
don't really want a controller to go and

1656
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,000
control everything we would like to do

1657
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,760
this with some sort of more classical

1658
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,199
fast reroute

1659
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:22,719
approach so local detection and a path

1660
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:25,199
that is suitable for repairing from this

1661
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,840
point which may be different from a path

1662
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,760
that's suitable in in another point so

1663
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,440
we may have to put a number of these in

1664
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,800
and we may need to merge them and we

1665
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:38,400
showed in our draft in draft rtg wg pla

1666
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,880
how we could do that next slide please

1667
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,679
right so this is um ac's question right

1668
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:50,239
so there are there are other um

1669
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,520
uses for this um one of them is as a

1670
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,440
complement to

1671
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,880
segment routing

1672
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,960
uh it's a it can be used as a method of

1673
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,760
creating binding sids where you want to

1674
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,600
inject a number of properties associated

1675
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,640
with those binding sys such as what the

1676
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:09,199
precise fast reroute strategy what cues

1677
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:11,360
to be used what bandwidth to allocate

1678
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,800
etc

1679
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,960
we can also use this as a method of

1680
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,239
providing ti lfa in ipv4 and ethernet

1681
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:24,159
networks and also in mpls and srv6

1682
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:26,719
networks where the overhead is critical

1683
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:28,480
because the nice thing about this is one

1684
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,280
identifier uh gets you there so we see

1685
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:34,080
this as a way of intro of adding

1686
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,239
bindings to a network but it has a

1687
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:38,239
number of other properties right so for

1688
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:41,120
example just skipping one for the moment

1689
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,920
there's no uh algorithm metric needed

1690
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,440
the path is the path you needed you

1691
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,840
don't need to trick the the path to go

1692
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,199
where you want it to go and so you can

1693
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:54,800
put an exact path in and also you have

1694
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,760
no constraint of 128 paths which is the

1695
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:01,199
algo limitation on flex algo

1696
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:03,120
we believe the part the method is

1697
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,560
suitable for underlays such as vpn plus

1698
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,199
and another area that we're starting to

1699
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:11,520
explore is energy efficient networks for

1700
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,640
industrial verticals where the path you

1701
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,960
use

1702
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,840
needs to be changed in order to maintain

1703
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,199
the sort of carbon

1704
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:23,040
set up and maintain the carbon footprint

1705
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,520
that you're trying to achieve next slide

1706
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,600
please

1707
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,679
so that is

1708
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:32,080
a a nine minute introduction as to what

1709
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:35,360
ppr is it's an introduction to what the

1710
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,480
uh

1711
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,239
to what we think the problem space is

1712
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:41,040
that this maps nicely to so has anyone

1713
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,719
got any questions and is there anyone

1714
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:44,800
interested in collaborating with us to

1715
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,560
see how where we can take this this

1716
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,320
approach

1717
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,320
i will start with peter with questions

1718
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,719
guys please be quick we are really

1719
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:55,360
taking time

1720
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:57,920
peter

1721
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,320
ah well tarek you were first

1722
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,199
okay

1723
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:04,560
thanks uh hi stuart so i have a question

1724
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,880
regarding the scale i mean you you are

1725
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,159
trying to save the overhead in the

1726
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:09,920
packet for a price of putting the

1727
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,320
overhead into the igps because you

1728
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,560
propose to advertise the the mapping

1729
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,760
between your identifier and the path

1730
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,120
i mean if you have many paths how

1731
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,560
scalable it is to put this in the iups

1732
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,040
um well we think it's uh we think it's

1733
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,560
scalable particularly as a lot of these

1734
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,040
networks are relatively small

1735
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,040
um and

1736
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,080
um

1737
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,239
so we think for example in a mobile

1738
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:36,320
phone as network we think it probably

1739
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,760
it'll probably work

1740
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,600
um we're not talking about doing the

1741
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:40,800
whole internet we're not talking about

1742
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,320
doing the whole core this way we're

1743
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,840
talking about

1744
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:44,880
edge

1745
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:45,840
uh

1746
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,239
cost sensitive in all of its terms

1747
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:50,320
networks that may want to map onto

1748
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,320
existing hardware

1749
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,239
well i mean your argument is we can do

1750
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:57,120
more algos than 128 etc so i assume you

1751
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,040
would have more than that number of

1752
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,040
paths and there is between various

1753
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,040
various endpoints so that adds to the

1754
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,080
scale

1755
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,760
right so i think there's some work done

1756
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,560
which um hasn't been widely discussed on

1757
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,760
how to redo

1758
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,679
flooding flooding reduction for this as

1759
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:13,040
well

1760
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,800
because you don't need to flood this

1761
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:15,920
outside the zone where you're going to

1762
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,040
use it and you know where it's going to

1763
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,320
be used from the information in the

1764
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,560
packet

1765
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,400
okay well that's my concern i mean

1766
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,600
there's a lot of stuff put into the igb

1767
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,320
all right thanks

1768
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,718
so much

1769
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:35,840
uh thanks stewart for the presentation

1770
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,120
and thanks peter for giving me the

1771
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,719
chance to speak

1772
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:42,239
so um my question is that there's a path

1773
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:45,360
state here uh uh stored or maintained on

1774
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,880
every node in your igp domain right

1775
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,400
well so we think we can do flooding

1776
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,640
reduction on this so it would be

1777
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,159
definitely stored on every node that

1778
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:56,080
needed to know about it but that's not

1779
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,640
an unreasonable requirement

1780
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,199
so stuart we had thought about similar

1781
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:03,360
approach but with this rather

1782
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,600
than relying on igp we

1783
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,679
used rzp to

1784
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:10,800
set up this path along the nose who are

1785
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:11,760
we

1786
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,040
when you say

1787
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,719
there it is

1788
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:16,320
myself and

1789
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,440
pushed in

1790
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,920
traffic engineering uh working group t's

1791
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,800
working group so a similar approach but

1792
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,120
uh but rather than relying on igp we

1793
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,280
relied on rsvp

1794
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:28,239
so

1795
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:30,159
so this but this fits in with the

1796
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:31,679
current philosophy which is to get rid

1797
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:34,800
of rsvp and rely

1798
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,280
and get rid of the for example the mpls

1799
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:40,640
protocols um that's one thing right and

1800
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:44,480
secondly um rsvp really only works with

1801
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:47,600
mpls and this will work with anything

1802
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,199
including one of the things that we

1803
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:52,400
looked at was we couldn't we apply this

1804
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,280
to

1805
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,760
link state ethernet

1806
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,719
systems so um this will apply this will

1807
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,760
also apply to v4 which is really the

1808
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,840
sort of poor child in all this and but

1809
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,400
the reality is that there is v4 out

1810
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,159
there

1811
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:09,840
exactly that's uh what i was trying to

1812
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,639
say is that the the draft we wrote uh

1813
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:16,880
was addressed for ipv4 and ipv60e

1814
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,159
but it i understand

1815
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:22,880
your your response uh there is per path

1816
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,680
state maintained in igp there that was

1817
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:27,760
[Music]

1818
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,199
thank you

1819
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:33,719
uh andrew please be quick one minute

1820
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,040
um

1821
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,800
stuart i just wanted to say thanks very

1822
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,239
much for the draft i hadn't gone through

1823
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:40,080
it before this meeting but

1824
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,760
in answer to your question if there's

1825
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,360
anybody interested in working with you

1826
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:44,400
on this

1827
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,440
100

1828
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,480
because

1829
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,639
i really like the philosophy of this and

1830
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:50,159
particularly

1831
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:51,280
within

1832
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,760
the african ecosystem where we do have a

1833
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,960
need for lower cost technologies etc

1834
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:57,840
with

1835
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,560
a lot of our clients etc this

1836
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,800
this is really really a very big

1837
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,000
interest to me

1838
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,840
so thanks very much and if you do need

1839
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,280
someone who's going to work with you on

1840
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,199
it 100

1841
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:10,800
thank you andrew really interested to

1842
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,960
know to to work with you particularly on

1843
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,639
use understanding the use cases but

1844
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:17,360
you're welcome to work on anything else

1845
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,000
is it g next or

1846
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,520
no no no we are going to cut here we are

1847
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,000
over time all right

1848
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:28,559
i see you mentioned the

1849
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,080
oh okay

1850
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,199
next presenter please

1851
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,639
hi can you hear me this is guillaume yes

1852
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:49,840
okay hi my name is gion mishra i'm with

1853
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,560
verizon and i will be presenting the

1854
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,199
updates on the apn framework and gap

1855
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:56,400
analysis

1856
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,760
on behalf of

1857
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,679
so as we said before we are really

1858
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:02,320
interested in changes and why do you

1859
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,400
think we should continue because you've

1860
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,719
got both this is probably third the

1861
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:09,199
first presentation please focus on the

1862
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:12,480
changes not on the material itself

1863
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:13,840
because we've seen energy for a couple

1864
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,760
of times okay

1865
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,320
thank you jeff

1866
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,239
all right

1867
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:24,159
so

1868
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:27,199
the the changes and updates to this uh

1869
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:29,199
the framework and just kind of carrying

1870
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:31,440
on from the um the lab this has been

1871
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:34,400
presented a few times so and i think

1872
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:37,280
what the goal of this presentation is to

1873
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:40,880
help provide more clarity to the apn

1874
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:44,719
solution and what the gaps that exist

1875
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:47,360
today and the solution that this

1876
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,360
provides and how it feels how this fills

1877
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:50,320
the gap

1878
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,120
so

1879
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,040
what i'd like to do is walk through this

1880
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,360
scenario and and

1881
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,840
and and really help depict kind of this

1882
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,719
use case and how it applies and then and

1883
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:03,679
then just go over the gaps and and where

1884
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,600
where the gaps exist today in current

1885
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,480
and existing solutions and where where

1886
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:09,199
we're

1887
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:11,120
where we're really uh

1888
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,400
have a fit for api so so let's so for to

1889
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,560
start i'll walk through this

1890
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,960
um this is basically an office

1891
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,800
productivity scenario

1892
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,840
and

1893
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,920
and just and what this does is i think

1894
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,679
to just point it and it really kind of

1895
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:28,159
goes to the updates that we had to apn

1896
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:31,360
it really is clarification of what apn

1897
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,440
provides and that's with this use case

1898
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,920
what i'm trying to do is really clarify

1899
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,840
and help help everyone understand kind

1900
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,480
of what what this does and how it

1901
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,199
helps move the ball forward um so with

1902
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:46,239
that so with that this um use case so

1903
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:47,840
it's described in

1904
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,560
section six in the apn framework draft

1905
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,560
uh but basically it's a typical office

1906
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,159
productivity scenario where you have a

1907
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:57,280
branch office it sits in domain one in

1908
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,360
city a connects across an operator

1909
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,159
backbone connecting cloud to cloud

1910
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:04,960
applications in city b connected to the

1911
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,880
another you know within another metro

1912
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,600
network so very typical office

1913
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,679
productivity series in this use case

1914
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:14,800
we're we were in this case it's an ipv6

1915
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,679
underlay so we're using srv6 end-to-end

1916
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:20,719
um traffic steering with an l3 vpn

1917
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:23,840
overlay so just a typical scenario uh

1918
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,400
next slide

1919
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:29,199
so this and this is really kind of kind

1920
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:31,199
of this is really the main update and

1921
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:32,560
then what we're doing is trying to

1922
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,880
provide more clarity and how this can be

1923
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:38,880
used so apn because it's providing an

1924
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,040
ability to

1925
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,560
allow for

1926
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,800
the same uh deep packet inspection that

1927
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,639
you get with key os now we're actually

1928
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:50,320
doing it with an apn id um that is um

1929
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,639
that id that's that's uh that is

1930
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:55,520
encapsulated added to the um

1931
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,600
to the to the to the uh

1932
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:01,199
packet so with that apn id uh because

1933
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:02,880
it's in the outer header versus deep

1934
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,800
packet inspection you're able to get

1935
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,360
that fine grain information at the outer

1936
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,679
layer so saves on you know

1937
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:12,639
hardware memory and cpu resources and

1938
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:14,960
actually going through the deep packet

1939
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,239
with that

1940
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:19,840
that apn id and with that being able to

1941
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,480
provide and this is the use the big

1942
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,239
really one of the use cases but being

1943
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:25,840
able to provide

1944
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,040
endpoint

1945
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,560
uh

1946
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,960
endpoint connectivity access control

1947
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,440
capability similar to an acl but now

1948
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,280
we're doing it at the at the network

1949
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,520
layer being being able to provide it

1950
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,000
with traffic steering where we're we're

1951
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,480
able to take a user group so let's say

1952
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,000
in this office productivity scenario we

1953
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
have a user group he's accessing cloud

1954
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,239
services and so with that file with

1955
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:50,639
those cloud services you have a

1956
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:54,239
a uh in within the apn id encoded you

1957
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:58,320
have the um a 5n tuple of um

1958
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,400
of headers that that you know that

1959
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,080
define the application flow and it could

1960
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:03,760
be any typical in this scenario we're

1961
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,000
showing voice video and data traffic so

1962
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,480
that traffic gets matched

1963
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,239
with the source ip and then it gets set

1964
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:13,120
to a user group so that specific user

1965
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,199
group is part of that endpoint

1966
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:16,960
application flow that's defined in the

1967
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,639
application id

1968
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:21,520
um and then and then with that

1969
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,480
it's it's matched to a um that source

1970
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,480
and destination and then it's set to the

1971
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,400
it's the user group is now set to an

1972
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,800
application group so we have the source

1973
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,360
get set to a user group and then data is

1974
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,600
actually classified to an application

1975
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,639
group so discreetly to control

1976
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:40,320
the um that fine grain and this is

1977
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,440
really where the action happens with apn

1978
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,440
being able to provide that fine grain on

1979
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,920
on a on an application basis

1980
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:51,159
next slide

1981
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,239
so

1982
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:54,239
with that with the with the access

1983
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:57,280
control what would this depict is in in

1984
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,840
that in that endpoint um

1985
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,040
uh control of uh end user application

1986
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:05,360
control from some particular user group

1987
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,120
mapping that to an application group so

1988
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,199
here what we're showing is we have a

1989
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:12,239
user group defined uh you know one zero

1990
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:13,440
zero one

1991
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,960
and then here we showed that there are

1992
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,960
other application groups that exist and

1993
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:19,440
so we're explicitly denying so that that

1994
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,440
application user group does that user

1995
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,280
group does not have access to these

1996
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,440
particular destination application

1997
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,320
groups

1998
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:29,440
and it only matches the 101 the the ones

1999
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:32,000
that we wanted to have access to so the

2000
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,320
one zero zero one one zero two one zero

2001
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,480
three so those are permitted so

2002
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:39,040
providing that fine grain application

2003
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,960
control uh from basically source

2004
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:44,000
destination literature therefore flow

2005
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,239
next slide

2006
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:54,000
so with that's the same concept about

2007
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,239
taking the with the fine grain infrared

2008
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,480
information to find five tuple sort

2009
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,239
layer three letter four information

2010
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:02,800
defining it mapping to a user group and

2011
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,880
then matching that user group mapping

2012
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:07,199
that to an application group now with

2013
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:09,440
that instead of having to

2014
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,199
uh

2015
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:13,280
do any type of deepak and inspection to

2016
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,679
determine where i want to apply

2017
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:18,560
um let's say if i i need iom like oam

2018
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,280
services to get uh telemetry information

2019
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:22,880
for a particular application flow it

2020
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,239
could be like voice or video or

2021
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:26,480
something that has high jitter latency

2022
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:29,040
could be across like a uh

2023
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:31,920
3gpp user plane or whatnot but let's say

2024
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,320
you want to apply ion just to that

2025
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:37,840
particular flow instead of having to

2026
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,920
require deeper packet inspection to go

2027
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,000
into the payload now you have this outer

2028
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,400
header this application id that's that's

2029
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,480
added to the payload but it i'm not

2030
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,000
adding there but added to the outer

2031
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,920
header so you don't have to go deep into

2032
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,920
the packet and you and that that

2033
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,760
information is right there that you can

2034
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,480
match so saving on hardware you know

2035
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,880
hardware you know resources

2036
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,840
and and um latency and uh processing of

2037
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:04,639
the packet and to apply the uh yeah and

2038
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,800
any iom um characteristics for uh

2039
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,280
telemetry and then and then once once

2040
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:12,639
that's done now at the at the head end

2041
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,480
of the um

2042
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,760
of the apn

2043
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:18,239
infrastructure now we're able to mat we

2044
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:20,000
got the classification done with the

2045
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,760
matching now we can redirect that flow

2046
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,400
and we can steer to that uh particular

2047
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,560
the you know particular uh

2048
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,440
srt trap srt path can now be

2049
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,120
instantiated

2050
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:33,599
next slide

2051
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,760
so as as far as gaps i

2052
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,679
in the last presentation

2053
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:42,000
at itm 111 we did go through a lot the

2054
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
gaps that exist so i just wanted to

2055
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,679
touch on those again

2056
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:48,239
um and this is something that there was

2057
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:49,920
a lot of question we spent a lot of time

2058
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,040
on this but

2059
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,520
really the the bottom line

2060
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:56,480
is that they exist there are existing

2061
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,239
solutions and what apn does it provides

2062
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:03,199
it provides its own it's it's it's a it

2063
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:06,480
provides a solution to you know for

2064
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:09,440
uh this fine grain sla capability

2065
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:11,280
however in looking at the existing

2066
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,520
solutions and mechanisms

2067
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,520
most and just looking at what we have

2068
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:18,239
here.net um with the flow id as well as

2069
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:20,480
network slicing with the resource id or

2070
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,080
as well as service function chaining

2071
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,880
would be

2072
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:23,840
the uh

2073
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,480
spi identifier they all have their own

2074
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,159
particular function that they're used

2075
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:30,800
for but being able to leverage those

2076
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,360
existing functions to actually

2077
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:36,880
provide that same type of fine grain sla

2078
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,639
is impossible because they have you

2079
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,000
can't really use

2080
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,840
these already have their pre-defined

2081
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,480
function so you can't really use this

2082
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,719
for another function this you know such

2083
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:48,960
as the fine-grained sla and that's where

2084
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,719
the apn id

2085
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:52,480
having this new

2086
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,920
um

2087
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,639
structured uh section you know section

2088
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:57,840
or or

2089
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,639
intelligent um id that's able to provide

2090
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:02,719
this fine-grained service i mean that's

2091
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:04,800
really kind of the big thing we did talk

2092
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:05,760
about

2093
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:06,639
other

2094
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:08,800
um other existing mechanisms like the

2095
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,199
float like like the ipv6 slow level that

2096
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:13,520
was discussed um quite in-depth

2097
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,239
and the issue that exists with the ipv6

2098
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:20,320
flow label is that it even with rc 6437

2099
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,719
they do mention in there that

2100
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:25,760
that stateless ecmp load balancing you

2101
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:29,360
know is supported in conjunction with

2102
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:32,719
state full uh signaling however

2103
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:34,719
you know the details of that is out of

2104
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:36,960
scope of that document and there isn't

2105
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,199
any even from six man in discussions

2106
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:41,679
there isn't any um use case or or

2107
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:43,199
scenario

2108
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:45,280
where that's how that's even possible

2109
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,159
and even in discussions with six man

2110
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:50,800
just in related to that um it's either

2111
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,639
one or the other and if you're using

2112
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:54,639
signaling and and there are some other

2113
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:56,159
drafts that talk more in detail or

2114
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:57,679
archie's to talk more in detail but if

2115
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,520
you're you're either using

2116
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,360
the flow label for signaling but then

2117
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,520
that would actually break ecmp and you

2118
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,679
really can't do both so that's that

2119
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:08,320
that's the big deal there the the other

2120
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,639
um

2121
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,120
thing that was meant i guess was qos and

2122
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,840
qos with so what geos provides i mean

2123
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:18,320
that that's been around for for decades

2124
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:21,280
and it's provided really it means you

2125
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:24,400
know providing sla you know and but what

2126
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,000
i would call quarter stream but it does

2127
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,360
provide sla for classifying traffic

2128
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,280
what this does kind of goes above and

2129
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,120
beyond that business now it's able to do

2130
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,480
some more

2131
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:37,520
acl type like um infrastructure acl type

2132
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,120
endpoint um

2133
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:42,320
flow flow uh management as well as being

2134
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,480
able to provide that same

2135
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,800
um qos type of uh

2136
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,960
traffic classification and privatization

2137
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:51,040
but now taking it kind of to the next

2138
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:55,360
next level a finer grain of um

2139
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:59,199
of classification next slide

2140
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:03,360
so in in the gap analysis we we

2141
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,520
this slide just kind of shows kind of

2142
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,239
although all the different existing

2143
01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:10,400
solutions that exist existing mechanisms

2144
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,639
that have used for existing technologies

2145
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:13,600
today

2146
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,560
so what apn what we feel is apn would be

2147
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:19,520
positioned for not only

2148
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,120
existing technologies but as well as

2149
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,800
future technology then it would also

2150
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,560
enhance any existing solution or

2151
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:27,120
technology that exists um let's say for

2152
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:29,920
example q os this could be used with as

2153
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:33,120
in conjunction to provide um a finer

2154
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:36,000
grade of application flows similar and

2155
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,280
similar to kind of what i did what i'd

2156
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:40,800
shown in the use case with um

2157
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:43,600
me being able to classify a further

2158
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,840
classification of interesting traffic

2159
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,360
with an acl but more granular so taking

2160
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,719
taking what you do what you have with

2161
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:53,280
qos but now applying acls to that and

2162
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,480
being able to do a really a more robust

2163
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:57,360
uh

2164
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,600
classification of characteristics and

2165
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,159
being able to map them to discrete um

2166
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:04,719
traffic engineer flows

2167
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:07,159
so in the in here you know we go through

2168
01:34:07,159 --> 01:34:09,440
iom.net and all the other flows i like

2169
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:11,280
mentioned the other uh

2170
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,280
mechanism that exists today they all

2171
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,639
have their discrete function that

2172
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:16,400
they're used for but then taking those

2173
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:17,840
functions

2174
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,760
those mechanisms that exist today and

2175
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,679
being able to leverage that to actually

2176
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:24,320
be to use it for apn

2177
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,239
is and that's what we're showing is that

2178
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:28,400
is that that is not possible they they

2179
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,239
are they they serve their function

2180
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:31,520
they're good that that's what they're

2181
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,760
made for but being able to leverage it

2182
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,679
to be used for apn

2183
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:38,400
uh would not be possible and that's why

2184
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,800
that's really why apn really kind of

2185
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,360
this the selling point on apn is

2186
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:46,000
what it can provide and really the gap

2187
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,080
that exists that existing

2188
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,239
existing solutions really are not there

2189
01:34:50,239 --> 01:34:52,159
that they can provide that

2190
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:54,159
decision

2191
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:56,638
next slide

2192
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:59,119
thank you so any comments

2193
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:01,679
questions for anyone i hope uh as i went

2194
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:03,360
through that if anyone has questions or

2195
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,119
comments just to help

2196
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:06,960
i can try to help explain and i guess

2197
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,800
there's a couple other slides decks that

2198
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,920
we're going to be going through with

2199
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:13,920
that robin shipping as well thank you uh

2200
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,679
we'll have one comment

2201
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:18,159
go ahead

2202
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:22,239
is about the id are you looking for

2203
01:35:22,239 --> 01:35:24,719
a per flow id or per

2204
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,119
per group of laws id

2205
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:30,000
i i i didn't catch that from your uh

2206
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,080
table

2207
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,719
sure so it's like again because it's

2208
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:37,760
granular it would be the flow would be

2209
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,400
it could be it could be a an aggregation

2210
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,440
of flows so any anything coming from a

2211
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:44,560
ce

2212
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:48,719
um it would be an aggregation of flows

2213
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,800
or it could be a single i think i think

2214
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:52,719
it's granular enough that i think if you

2215
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:54,159
had to

2216
01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:56,239
make because it's based on acls and

2217
01:35:56,239 --> 01:35:58,800
source destination you really could have

2218
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,480
it as fine as gra

2219
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,480
as granular as you would like and that's

2220
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,639
up to the uh operator

2221
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:05,840
you know how grainy where you would like

2222
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,199
to make it

2223
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:08,960
the reason i'm asking is

2224
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,600
you know i presume flow id is already

2225
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,440
known right

2226
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:14,960
you can have a

2227
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,679
flow id embedded in a in a flow label

2228
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:19,360
for example

2229
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:21,599
yeah

2230
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:22,840
okay

2231
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,719
understood

2232
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:26,719
thank you thanks john next presenter

2233
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:29,719
please

2234
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,560
rick you can ask the question meanwhile

2235
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,960
i will switch the slides oh okay thank

2236
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,719
you okay so

2237
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:47,199
i'm glad you mentioned qos as the as the

2238
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:48,960
kind of the de facto

2239
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,719
standard for for

2240
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:52,560
labeling application flows in in

2241
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,199
existing edge networks um one of the

2242
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:57,600
nice properties of of the qos bits of

2243
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,520
course is that when you're traveling

2244
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:02,719
across uh an ipsec tunnel qos can be

2245
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:03,920
promoted

2246
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:07,199
do you consider the apn uh

2247
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:08,800
information that the the header

2248
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,960
information also being

2249
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,520
sort of uh carried from the inside of

2250
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,600
tunnels during the encapsulation process

2251
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:16,400
to the

2252
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,960
to the encapsulating packet is that in

2253
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,719
your model have you considered that at

2254
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:22,880
all

2255
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:25,840
yes so

2256
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,080
let's just understand yeah so the the

2257
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,400
apn id it would be encapsulated and it

2258
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,639
would be part of the um so the data

2259
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:34,400
packet that gets transmitted so that the

2260
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,639
apn engine would be

2261
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:39,040
print it would be in the um and in the

2262
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:41,199
packet and you know throughout the apn

2263
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:43,280
domain so throughout that closed domain

2264
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:44,480
and then um

2265
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:47,040
and then removed at the egress point

2266
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:49,360
of the domain

2267
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:51,840
okay okay i i really like this by the

2268
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:52,960
way i think

2269
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:55,360
we've been desperately searching for a

2270
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,760
solution to this but we haven't realized

2271
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,239
it as the ietf so i i totally support

2272
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:01,520
this thank you

2273
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,480
thank you thank you

2274
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,239
rob please go ahead

2275
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:09,920
okay

2276
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:12,560
okay uh this is the champion uh so uh

2277
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:15,440
from huawei uh we i will introduce this

2278
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:17,280
the

2279
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,920
encapsulation of the apn so the

2280
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:22,560
encapsulation including the

2281
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,719
apn header and

2282
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:26,639
also this the

2283
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:30,719
data plane ipv6 so means the ipv6

2284
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:33,440
encapsulation for the epm header of the

2285
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:36,159
next page

2286
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:40,000
okay so according to the api framework

2287
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,960
so that's the api header can be easily

2288
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,480
be abstract

2289
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:47,600
so here we can see that the we have this

2290
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,360
the apid

2291
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:51,840
because we have the different

2292
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,639
maybe we have the different uh scope for

2293
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:58,080
the apid so here defined the two types

2294
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,760
of the api id

2295
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,800
one is the short api id is 32 bits

2296
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:05,960
another is the long apid is

2297
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:08,159
128 bits

2298
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:10,159
and also that's

2299
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:13,600
the apid is mandatory in the epn header

2300
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:16,000
besides the apid there's the two

2301
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,880
optional uh the fields one is the

2302
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:22,880
entrant so this means the represent the

2303
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:25,119
set of the service requirement to the

2304
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:29,360
network for specific apid

2305
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:32,480
and also that we also have this the epm

2306
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,760
parameter

2307
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:37,360
so that's this is the apm parameters

2308
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:40,719
defined for the specific apid

2309
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:43,360
and also in order to indicate

2310
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:44,800
if the

2311
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:49,040
specific apm parameter exists or not

2312
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:52,080
in the api header so we have the fields

2313
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,480
of the epm parameter type

2314
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,320
so use a

2315
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:59,840
60 16 bit identifier

2316
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:02,480
you use each bit to

2317
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:05,199
subversive like versify

2318
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:10,560
which vpn apm parameter are exists

2319
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:14,159
in exist in the epm header or not so

2320
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:17,520
that means they use a bitmap

2321
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:22,440
okay so there is a header next slide

2322
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:26,560
okay so apid can be divided into three

2323
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:27,760
parts

2324
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:31,040
so that's the cursor is the api group id

2325
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:34,639
and the user ib group id and then this

2326
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:38,080
reserved so the length of the app group

2327
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:41,520
id user group id and the result fields

2328
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,760
can be variable so this can be

2329
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:46,800
configured in the domain and be

2330
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,880
consisted in the specific network domain

2331
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:54,000
okay next slides

2332
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:59,280
okay so here we defined this the uh four

2333
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:02,480
apn calimeters for the network uh

2334
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,480
service requirement

2335
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:07,440
so that's the this is the bandwidth and

2336
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:10,239
the delay and delay variation and the

2337
01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:12,880
package the loss ratio uh for the

2338
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:15,360
specific api id

2339
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:18,639
accordingly we will define this the four

2340
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:22,080
bit for the apm parameter type so that's

2341
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,480
a huge bit to indicate

2342
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:26,480
a specific

2343
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:32,678
api parameter exist or not next slide

2344
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:37,360
okay so this is the ipv6 encapsulation

2345
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:40,880
for the apn header so we defined that's

2346
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,320
the option

2347
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,560
so that's the the one

2348
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:46,159
this is

2349
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:48,159
the has uh

2350
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:50,480
defined this is the option type under

2351
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:51,920
the data length

2352
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:55,600
then this is the uh value now the data

2353
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,159
option data the option data is just the

2354
01:41:58,159 --> 01:41:59,760
api header

2355
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:01,280
defined

2356
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:04,880
so this option can be used in the whole

2357
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:05,840
backup

2358
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,239
option header and the destination open

2359
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:09,280
header

2360
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:11,020
besides this the whole

2361
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:12,159
[Music]

2362
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:13,280
the

2363
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:16,239
api option used for the

2364
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:18,080
extension header

2365
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:20,639
because we know that the

2366
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:24,400
for the srh there's the option tre

2367
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:27,600
so that's the apn can be also used

2368
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:30,080
combining with the segment list

2369
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:33,760
so we also defined this the epntrv

2370
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:34,960
used

2371
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:39,040
in the srh so here this is the format it

2372
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,880
has a type length

2373
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:43,840
d flag so then this is the data is the

2374
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,679
api header

2375
01:42:45,679 --> 01:42:47,440
okay that's all

2376
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:49,678
okay

2377
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:52,080
let's go to the next presentation then

2378
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:54,880
ask question if any

2379
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:59,159
after that shipping

2380
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:11,440
okay

2381
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,960
so

2382
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:15,840
hi everybody i'm going to introduce you

2383
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,679
about our new work

2384
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:19,760
on the control plane and the management

2385
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:23,119
plan let's please

2386
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,360
first about the flow spec

2387
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:28,080
and we define a new flowspace component

2388
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:31,119
apn id and here is the encoding

2389
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:34,480
we use the mask to indicate the base of

2390
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:37,360
the apin id carried in the packets

2391
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:39,840
and to be matched against the one the ap

2392
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:42,320
id carried in the float back

2393
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:43,840
so here

2394
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:46,800
this diagram shows an example

2395
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:49,920
and you could see that the mask is used

2396
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,960
to match the app group id

2397
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:55,760
next please

2398
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,800
and we also defined a few traffic

2399
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:02,400
filtering actions and they are used to

2400
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:05,520
mark the ap id in different ways

2401
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:10,080
and we could mark the entire ap id all a

2402
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,840
partial ap id

2403
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:15,199
and for the inherit is that one day pin

2404
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:18,840
id is already carried in the package

2405
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:23,600
one is go into a outer tunnel and this

2406
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:26,880
ap id could be inherited and that is

2407
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:30,159
copied and encapsulated in the outer

2408
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:31,520
tunnel header

2409
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:32,880
and

2410
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:35,679
and also for the stage

2411
01:44:35,679 --> 01:44:38,880
action that is part of the ap id already

2412
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,639
carried in the package

2413
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:41,679
will be

2414
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:45,199
stitched with the a part of the ap id

2415
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:47,840
card in the flow spec

2416
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:50,239
so those two parts will be integrated

2417
01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:54,799
into one ap id next piece

2418
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:58,320
and here and the ordering of the flows

2419
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,880
back is also important for apn there are

2420
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:04,000
two reasons one is that there are also

2421
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,880
other coexisting flows back rules

2422
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:10,080
and besides the apn flows back rules

2423
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:13,199
and also because we know ap id is

2424
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:16,000
structured and different parts of it can

2425
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,880
be decided by different rules

2426
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:22,560
so that means we need to have a careful

2427
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,800
organization of those rules

2428
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,199
here we introduce

2429
01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:30,880
this new ec and we have the group id and

2430
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,560
the subgroup id

2431
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:33,600
and

2432
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,639
for within the sub provided is actually

2433
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:37,760
the same

2434
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,480
as what we have previously defined that

2435
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:43,840
depends on whether the traffic action is

2436
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:46,719
carried out not out and whether the t

2437
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:48,880
flag is set

2438
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:49,679
and

2439
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:53,199
once when when one condition in the

2440
01:45:53,199 --> 01:45:56,159
subgroup is matched the evaluation of

2441
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:59,280
the n is subsequent flow specifications

2442
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:01,199
within this subgroup

2443
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:02,560
will stop

2444
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:05,600
and between subgroups that is uh because

2445
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:09,920
each subgroup contains the rules for

2446
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:14,000
for tagging the one part of the ap id

2447
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,679
so

2448
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:18,719
all the sub groups will

2449
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:22,080
will be evaluated one by one and between

2450
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,119
the groups

2451
01:46:23,119 --> 01:46:27,119
we gave the group with a priority

2452
01:46:27,119 --> 01:46:29,520
and that means once

2453
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:33,600
there is a one condition is matched in a

2454
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:36,000
group in the ap group

2455
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:36,960
and

2456
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:40,880
the following evaluation will stop

2457
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:43,760
next please

2458
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,239
so here is about young model

2459
01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:47,360
and uh

2460
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:49,280
there are a few parts of this young one

2461
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:52,320
of currently we only focus on the ipv6

2462
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:55,280
data plane and we define global action

2463
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:57,760
that is for the inherited which

2464
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:58,639
i

2465
01:46:58,639 --> 01:46:59,600
just

2466
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:00,880
introduced

2467
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:04,080
and then it's about the ap id templates

2468
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,679
and to define

2469
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:09,280
the templates for this structured apid

2470
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:13,199
and for the marking and we could mark

2471
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:17,040
the ap id based on the uh

2472
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,920
the templates we have selected

2473
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:22,400
that is once you select the

2474
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:26,719
the flow and then you tag the api id

2475
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:30,159
and and lastly is the mapping policies

2476
01:47:30,159 --> 01:47:32,880
and we could use color to differentiate

2477
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:36,480
my pin uh policies to indicate those uh

2478
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,960
different set of mapping policies

2479
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:40,000
and

2480
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,440
then based on the ap id we could decide

2481
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:44,320
which

2482
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,800
as our policies to go into based on the

2483
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:48,159
color and

2484
01:47:48,159 --> 01:47:51,280
it could also be the redirect to the

2485
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:52,560
nasda hop

2486
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:57,040
and that is belongs to the native ip

2487
01:47:57,040 --> 01:48:00,239
next piece yes that's all thank you any

2488
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:03,239
questions

2489
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:13,678
greg please one very short question

2490
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:16,719
i think they will be good uh to get more

2491
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:19,679
information and on the list

2492
01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:20,719
um

2493
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:24,560
on what their expectation of um

2494
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:26,400
having

2495
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,800
in the profile

2496
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:33,920
packet to us ratio and a jitter so

2497
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,400
i understand that that's uh to be added

2498
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:39,520
in uh ipv6 uh

2499
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,119
encapsulation

2500
01:48:41,119 --> 01:48:42,800
for apn

2501
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:46,560
so what their uh expectation of how

2502
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:50,320
that can be used is it constrained for

2503
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:51,440
uh

2504
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:53,520
forwarders

2505
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:54,320
or

2506
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:57,440
local path selection or such so

2507
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:01,839
just let's discuss it on the list

2508
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:06,559
and next presenter

2509
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:10,080
hey hello can you hear me

2510
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:12,000
yes

2511
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,760
hi uh this is ray from alibaba uh we're

2512
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:17,440
going to present uh how we're going to

2513
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,440
precisely control the conditioning

2514
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:22,400
condition inside network and that also

2515
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:25,040
relate to how we choose the route inside

2516
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:27,840
the data center together we contribute

2517
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:30,320
to the low latency networking

2518
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,080
for our applications

2519
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:34,960
next slide please

2520
01:49:35,119 --> 01:49:38,880
so uh today's a new application such as

2521
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:40,480
high performance storage and the

2522
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,760
large-scale

2523
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,920
deep learning applications

2524
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:46,239
use a new hardware that can generate

2525
01:49:46,239 --> 01:49:47,440
data

2526
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:50,400
orders or magnitude faster than before

2527
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:53,199
so that requires a low latency

2528
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:55,760
for the network and also

2529
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:57,599
that network become more important than

2530
01:49:57,599 --> 01:49:58,560
before

2531
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:00,480
and another trend is that

2532
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:02,639
resource disaggregation is happening

2533
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:04,080
inside clouds

2534
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:06,719
which separate the compute and storage

2535
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:08,960
and memory into different

2536
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:12,320
separate recessive pools so even memory

2537
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:14,320
access will go through the network in

2538
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:18,159
the future so that that means that um

2539
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:20,719
we will add considerable load to the

2540
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:22,159
network

2541
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:25,599
and also require ultra latency

2542
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:27,679
so um how we're gonna

2543
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:30,400
solve this issue is a question mark for

2544
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,239
our future

2545
01:50:32,239 --> 01:50:35,040
next slide please

2546
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:40,719
next slide please

2547
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,599
hello

2548
01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:55,040
engine can you progress

2549
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:58,400
um so because due to the slow down of

2550
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,880
the mars law and cpu cannot keep up with

2551
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:03,840
the traffic rate so there are lots of

2552
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,119
effort

2553
01:51:05,119 --> 01:51:08,080
to offload the computing and the data

2554
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:09,840
transferring

2555
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:11,040
workload

2556
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:15,520
to the hardware such as rdma and the dpu

2557
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:16,800
however

2558
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,560
using faster

2559
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,400
hardware that can generate data more

2560
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:21,920
aggressively that causes severe

2561
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:24,320
condition inside network

2562
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:27,199
next slide please

2563
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:31,679
so um we observed a couple of issue in

2564
01:51:31,679 --> 01:51:33,360
today's condition control inside

2565
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:35,199
high-speed network

2566
01:51:35,199 --> 01:51:37,599
first of all is that

2567
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:40,000
we those network has to use a

2568
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,800
float-based flow level

2569
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:44,239
of flow control

2570
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:47,920
such as pfc to reduce the packet loss

2571
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:50,080
however due to the

2572
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:52,320
pfc stall and the deadlock happen in the

2573
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:55,520
inside clouds which cause the stability

2574
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:56,320
issue

2575
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:57,840
of our network

2576
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:00,400
and this whole reason is because that

2577
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:03,119
the country is a have a slow convergence

2578
01:52:03,119 --> 01:52:05,599
time so that's why we cannot resolve

2579
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:08,880
congestion um in time the second issue

2580
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:11,920
that we cannot run multiple

2581
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:16,000
applications together inside the cluster

2582
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,679
and they were using

2583
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:20,080
um qualitative service queue cannot

2584
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:22,560
solve this this issue because

2585
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:25,679
uh qasq is very skilled resources

2586
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:27,119
which has been

2587
01:52:27,119 --> 01:52:30,159
allocated to different applications

2588
01:52:30,159 --> 01:52:32,800
the the rhythm behind this is that uh

2589
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:35,360
existing solution using standing queue

2590
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:38,080
to identify condition and a standing cue

2591
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:40,880
itself being a

2592
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:41,920
issue

2593
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:44,159
of latency

2594
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:46,159
the last one is

2595
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:48,239
today's congestion control solution

2596
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:51,119
using many parameters to

2597
01:52:51,119 --> 01:52:54,000
using here's the heuristic approach to

2598
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,440
adjust the

2599
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:57,199
condition status

2600
01:52:57,199 --> 01:52:58,639
um

2601
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:01,520
next slides please

2602
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:04,000
so there the new

2603
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,639
trend inside the silicon switching

2604
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:10,000
silicon is that inband tenement tree so

2605
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,840
new switches

2606
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:14,719
has invented telemetry ability

2607
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:18,080
uh if um for example inside this figure

2608
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,239
that when the packet goes to the switch

2609
01:53:20,239 --> 01:53:22,400
the switch can add a

2610
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:24,880
tenant tray information

2611
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:26,400
into the package

2612
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:27,360
so it

2613
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:30,159
so each switch can add some information

2614
01:53:30,159 --> 01:53:33,360
into the packet and those packy and the

2615
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:35,920
telemation information can be redirected

2616
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:38,000
to the remote collector

2617
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:38,960
um

2618
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:41,440
to fund the uh the

2619
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:42,800
uh

2620
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:44,800
many use for troubleshooting purpose

2621
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:46,159
such as uh

2622
01:53:46,159 --> 01:53:49,119
where the packet get lost is any routing

2623
01:53:49,119 --> 01:53:50,480
black hole

2624
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:52,800
etc

2625
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:55,440
the next slide please

2626
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:57,840
so with this new opportunity and the

2627
01:53:57,840 --> 01:53:59,760
primitives uh

2628
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:02,800
of imbalancement tree the question

2629
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:04,960
for us is that can we use that

2630
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:06,239
information

2631
01:54:06,239 --> 01:54:08,719
as a precise information for us to to do

2632
01:54:08,719 --> 01:54:11,199
condition control so that's the original

2633
01:54:11,199 --> 01:54:14,639
idea which we call the hpcc

2634
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:15,520
and

2635
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:17,760
if the so when the packet goes through

2636
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:20,480
the network and each switch along the

2637
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:22,560
path will add animation information into

2638
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:25,119
the package when the package arrives at

2639
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:26,719
the destination

2640
01:54:26,719 --> 01:54:28,080
and the reserver can generate

2641
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:30,960
notification packet or icon packet back

2642
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:33,119
to the sender to add adjust the sending

2643
01:54:33,119 --> 01:54:35,440
rate

2644
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:38,400
next slide please

2645
01:54:39,119 --> 01:54:42,560
so um in hpcc we define the algorithm to

2646
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,719
using those tiny machine information for

2647
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:46,800
condition control those information

2648
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:49,280
including the q lens

2649
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:52,000
transmitted bytes timestamp

2650
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,920
link capacity etc so we actually

2651
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:59,520
defined how we can use those information

2652
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:01,760
and how we can calculate the precise

2653
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:04,719
ascending ray based on that however the

2654
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:07,199
actual package format is depend on the

2655
01:55:07,199 --> 01:55:10,400
environment so here we give an example

2656
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,400
of telemetry

2657
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:13,840
being embedded

2658
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:16,400
into the

2659
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:20,159
a certain tenementary form format

2660
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:22,400
then the green color

2661
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:25,040
showed that information we utilized and

2662
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:26,480
we defined

2663
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:29,199
in hvcc

2664
01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:32,678
next slide please

2665
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:34,960
so when we use this approach to

2666
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:37,760
precisely uh identify and control the

2667
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:40,719
sending rate and we solve the all three

2668
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:43,440
issues previously mentioned first of all

2669
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:45,520
we achieve faster convergence because we

2670
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:48,000
know precisely how much we can send to

2671
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,400
the network without causing the

2672
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,520
congestion

2673
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:53,119
and then secondly we

2674
01:55:53,119 --> 01:55:55,280
we know that

2675
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:57,119
we base our information based on the

2676
01:55:57,119 --> 01:55:59,040
tenant trading information not based on

2677
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:02,080
the q length so we actually don't

2678
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:04,320
require a queuing in the

2679
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:07,520
in the switch so we can actually achieve

2680
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:10,400
a near zero q to achieve uh both high

2681
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:12,480
throughput and low latency

2682
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:13,840
and the

2683
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:15,920
because we we know precisely what's

2684
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:18,159
going on in the network so we don't need

2685
01:56:18,159 --> 01:56:21,360
a heuristic approach to guess uh what's

2686
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:24,080
happening inside network and we we

2687
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:29,199
that's why we use very few uh parameters

2688
01:56:29,199 --> 01:56:31,839
next please

2689
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:34,719
so

2690
01:56:34,719 --> 01:56:36,560
so that also relates to the routing

2691
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:38,639
inside network as well because

2692
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:40,480
route condition changes dramatically

2693
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:42,719
inside data center

2694
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:45,679
for example incas can happen

2695
01:56:45,679 --> 01:56:48,560
quite frequently and link failure due to

2696
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:51,360
a routing black hole and also silent

2697
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,840
jobs can also happen in particular

2698
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:56,159
routes and applications want to fast

2699
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:58,560
reroute to a different path to avoid

2700
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:00,239
this

2701
01:57:00,239 --> 01:57:03,440
temporary failure or partial failure so

2702
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:04,560
um

2703
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:07,840
rerouting is a is a kind of a lightwork

2704
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:08,880
network

2705
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:11,840
primitive provide for application uh

2706
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:14,320
before the application got affected

2707
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:16,719
so uh spc is actually

2708
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:19,520
using those precise information

2709
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:20,239
to

2710
01:57:20,239 --> 01:57:21,920
kind of have a view

2711
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:25,119
of a router capacity we know how much

2712
01:57:25,119 --> 01:57:27,119
traffic we can send to a particular

2713
01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:29,679
route if this route has failure which

2714
01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:31,679
means that there is a zero capacity we

2715
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:34,480
must do the re-route as soon as possible

2716
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:37,360
so joint with the routing and the

2717
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:39,760
traffic allocation so we can have a

2718
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:42,960
combined view at the endpoint site to

2719
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:45,119
decide how much traffic we can send to

2720
01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:47,520
each of each route if the bad condition

2721
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:49,280
happens we can switch the traffic to a

2722
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:52,480
different route to avoid the avoid

2723
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:56,159
impact to the to the application

2724
01:57:56,159 --> 01:57:58,719
next please

2725
01:57:59,199 --> 01:58:02,320
so let's give our

2726
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:05,119
evaluation results

2727
01:58:05,119 --> 01:58:06,880
in the production

2728
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:09,040
when we implement into the smart link we

2729
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:11,199
see that the traffic

2730
01:58:11,199 --> 01:58:14,239
actually been uh the latency has been

2731
01:58:14,239 --> 01:58:15,440
reduced

2732
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:16,960
uh to up to

2733
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:19,119
uh 95 percent

2734
01:58:19,119 --> 01:58:22,000
in the small messages if you look at the

2735
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,159
left figure

2736
01:58:24,159 --> 01:58:26,880
and and that's happened because we

2737
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:29,199
actually control the q length

2738
01:58:29,199 --> 01:58:31,280
and reserve the congestion if you look

2739
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:33,440
at the right curve which shows the

2740
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:34,400
distribution

2741
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:37,280
of the buffer usage inside the switch

2742
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:39,840
and even in the 99 percentile

2743
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:43,040
we only have a 23 kilobytes buffer

2744
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:45,840
and inside the switch which at only a

2745
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:48,320
seven micro second delay

2746
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,800
because for our for many applications

2747
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:52,880
every microsecond matters so we need to

2748
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:56,800
control reduce the latency uh

2749
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:59,040
as much as possible

2750
01:58:59,040 --> 01:58:59,920
um

2751
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:01,440
thank you that's a

2752
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:04,080
listen and for my presentation and if

2753
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:06,159
you if you are interested in working

2754
01:59:06,159 --> 01:59:07,520
with us

2755
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:09,599
to collaborate on this

2756
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:14,320
topic please email to us thank you

2757
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:19,360
thanks and we've got robin in the queue

2758
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:22,000
oh quick so i want to know the purpose

2759
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,480
of this the draft user defender

2760
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:25,840
framework

2761
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:28,719
or user tried to propose some of the

2762
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:30,400
protocol extension

2763
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:32,480
according my understanding because we

2764
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:35,760
know that already has this the ippm

2765
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:37,920
working group that's the imbalance

2766
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:39,679
elementary

2767
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:41,840
and also we also have this traffic

2768
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:45,599
engineering work in the rtg area

2769
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:47,119
so what's

2770
01:59:47,119 --> 01:59:52,719
what's the work of the hpcc class

2771
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:58,000
so ip ippm is defined in the the format

2772
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,239
of the information being put into the

2773
02:00:00,239 --> 02:00:02,960
data package so our work is defined the

2774
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:04,320
algorithm

2775
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:07,119
because uh this across has to be

2776
02:00:07,119 --> 02:00:09,280
implemented in both the

2777
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:11,520
the end host in the switch around the

2778
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:14,320
path so it's different different vendors

2779
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:17,360
so we want to have a a general

2780
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:19,760
agreement under an algorithm and a

2781
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:22,800
protocol so we can coordinate with

2782
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:24,719
different parts of the net inside

2783
02:00:24,719 --> 02:00:27,520
network to work together so that's the

2784
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:30,000
purpose is we want to provide a a kind

2785
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:34,159
of a framework and a protocol so to

2786
02:00:34,159 --> 02:00:36,400
define especially that how the algorithm

2787
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:37,440
works

2788
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:38,159
and

2789
02:00:38,159 --> 02:00:40,719
beyond that because that's also related

2790
02:00:40,719 --> 02:00:41,599
to the

2791
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:43,760
um how we choose the different routes

2792
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:45,440
based on the condition of

2793
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:49,280
of each route so that also require the

2794
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:52,560
the software part to to be aligned with

2795
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:55,840
hardware implementation

2796
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:57,360
okay

2797
02:00:57,360 --> 02:01:00,480
we are over time uh i think it's really

2798
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:02,960
interesting work and

2799
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:05,760
i mean we are very very far away on

2800
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:08,000
distribution of reachability

2801
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,639
however this work brings us

2802
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:12,960
knowledge about condition of the network

2803
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:14,800
and also defines both standard as well

2804
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:17,679
as transport nodes so we'll be working

2805
02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:19,760
with authors to provide kind of better

2806
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:21,679
alignment with what routing

2807
02:01:21,679 --> 02:01:22,400
area

2808
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:25,280
is all about but i think this is

2809
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:27,199
something we really need to work on this

2810
02:01:27,199 --> 02:01:28,800
step is coming up artificial

2811
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:30,800
intelligence being deployed in all large

2812
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:32,159
data centers

2813
02:01:32,159 --> 02:01:35,599
and today's igps and bgp doesn't address

2814
02:01:35,599 --> 02:01:37,760
it that's why you see the presentation

2815
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:39,119
here

2816
02:01:39,119 --> 02:01:41,040
uh we are over time i would like to

2817
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:43,679
thank everybody in microsoft engine it's

2818
02:01:43,679 --> 02:01:45,520
been really great meeting and i really

2819
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:47,840
really hope to see you face to face next

2820
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:50,800
atf have a great day and see you next

2821
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:52,159
time yeah

2822
02:01:52,159 --> 02:01:55,119
and we are sorry we couldn't let the bfd

2823
02:01:55,119 --> 02:01:57,360
presentation happen because um we are

2824
02:01:57,360 --> 02:02:01,960
really running out of time so

2825
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:08,400
see you next time

2826
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:11,119
bye everyone

2827
02:02:11,119 --> 02:02:13,470
it's time

2828
02:02:13,470 --> 02:02:16,649
[Music]

2829
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:12,480
you
