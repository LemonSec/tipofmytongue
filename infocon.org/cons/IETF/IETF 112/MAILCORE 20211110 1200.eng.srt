early hours here in the u.s or what but

19
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,680
attendance isn't as

20
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,080
heavy as i hoped it would be but we'll

21
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,920
we'll muddle through not just the same

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,640
it's mostly um just bringing a number of

34
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,879
tickets to closure

35
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,040

about potentially have an interim

40
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,200
meeting in december and then a little

41
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,640
bit about the applicability statement

42
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,040
does anyone have any issues with the

43
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,879
agenda any changes they'd like to make

44
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,079
any additions they'd like to make

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,120
seeing none

46
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,159
let's pile forward

47
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
pete wanted to let us know regarding rfc

48
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,840
5322

49
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,760
what status is right now he's kind of

50
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
fixed one bit of awkward text and put

51
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
back an optional field

52
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,840
in trace recent block

53
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,640
uh

54
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,319
still need to clean out the editor's

55
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,080
notes and he thinks he's ready for the

56
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,760
working group last call unless something

57
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,079
comes up

58
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,399
any questions on the status 5322

59
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,840
okay

60
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,520
all right first ticket 5321 further

61
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,199
clarification needed to duplicate source

62
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,080
routes last week alexey posted

63
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,120
essentially

64
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,919
the contents of this slide to the list

65
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,440
presenting various options on how to

66
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,800
handle source routes in the current

67
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,040
version of the spec

68
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,360
it seemed that the mailing list had a

69
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,280
preference for option a

70
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,120
which is to strip all strip all

71
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,720
mentioning of handling of source routes

72
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,800
in the text in the abnf other than

73
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,360
specify their historical use

74
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,479
does anyone have a different

75
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,320
understanding of how the conversation

76
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,160
went on the list or does anyone have an

77
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,759
argument to make for options b c or

78
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,360
any

79
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,600
other option

80
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,120
john

81
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,759
go ahead and speak

82
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,800
uh yeah i i i'm certainly okay with with

83
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,240
that uh consensus interpretation

84
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
but i just want to point out this that

85
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,960
this stuff is scattered to the document

86
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
and it's significant it's a significant

87
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,960
change and i think we should make it

88
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,880
only if people are

89
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,560
willing to agree to look carefully at

90
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,360
what i do because i may screw it up and

91
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,360
we don't want any scopes to get into the

92
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,160
uh in the final document

93
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,520
right the next

94
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,840
i believe

95
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,639
i'm very reluctant to make significant

96
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,840
changes here without a lot of

97
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,520
cross-checking

98
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,000
sure the next the next eight or nine

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,280
slides in the deck um i believe are all

100
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,199
of the content that references source

101
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,160
routing

102
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,680
um

103
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,840
so that will get the first pass at that

104
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,280
cross check that you're looking for

105
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,199
during this meeting today

106
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,960
but certainly there will be a lot more

107
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,360
cross-checking going on i'm sure

108
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,520
well hope so thank you

109
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,520
sure

110
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,400
anyone else have

111
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,840
anything to say regarding the options

112
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,199
presented here

113
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,800
any argument to make for bc or d

114
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,720
okay

115
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,479
moving on

116
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,080
as i said during the conversation with

117
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,400
john a moment ago the next several

118
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,840
slides are the

119
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,840
relevant content within 5321 that

120
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,680
addresses source routes

121
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,800
um

122
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,360
starting with the the last sentence in

123
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,759
section 2.1 uh regarding explicit shows

124
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,199
explicit source routing should not be

125
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,160
used

126
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,080
uh the proposal is changed to must not

127
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,919
be used and remove any reference to

128
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,680
section 5 since section five doesn't

129
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,080
discuss source routing

130
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,960
um

131
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,199
also in the fifth paragraph of section

132
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,840
three three under mail transactions

133
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,360
proposal here is to change the should

134
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,599
not use source routing two must not use

135
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,840
source routing

136
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,360
does anyone have anything to say

137
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,919
regarding these two minor changes

138
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,759
well minor in terms of number of words

139
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,639
not minor in terms of significance

140
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,759
okay

141
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,280
uh again

142
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,199
in the mail transaction section there is

143
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,720
a reference to

144
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,280
contemporary smtp clients should not use

145
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,479
source routes

146
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,680
and uh the proposed change here hey todd

147
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,080
there's uh there's a message in the chat

148
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,680
that you may want to

149
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,960
really hear

150
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,720
there was a message in the uh camera

151
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,919
yeah

152
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,680
yeah yeah see i apologize for missing

153
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,199
that i've been glancing at the chat on

154
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,639
the different screen and i missed

155
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,599
um

156
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,879
valid valid comment ned um

157
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,639
ned's comment is i thought the idea was

158
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,160
to remove discussion not turn it into

159
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,800
prohibitions

160
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,039
so

161
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,039
i don't know that we're um

162
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,958
i mean option b was to allow source

163
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,559
routing in the abn f but strengthen

164
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,080
existing text

165
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,279
all right you're right you're correct

166
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,000
that is option b uh alexi wrote these

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,200
slides i didn't i apologize for the uh

168
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,880
the seeming

169
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,080
um

170
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,600
misalignment here

171
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,080
um

172
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,440
so yes you're correct so

173
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,600
then the proposal ought to be in keeping

174
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,000
with option a here on on uh this slide

175
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,480
to remove the sentence entirely

176
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:02,890
um

177
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,200
[Music]

178
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,800
with the fifth paragraph in mail

179
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,519
transactions

180
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:09,970
um

181
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,360
[Music]

182
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,279
i guess we would just remove everything

183
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,120
after the semicolon the however

184
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,399
contemporary system should not use

185
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,640
source routing

186
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,000
yeah

187
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
okay

188
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
so ned's ned's comment is just remove

189
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,560
the discussion entirely um does anybody

190
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,720
have any

191
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,200
any disagreement with that

192
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
and i

193
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
wasn't thinking when i was reviewing

194
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,880
these slides last night to notice this

195
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,440
so

196
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,600
if we remove it entirely which seems

197
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,680
fine

198
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,320
it's not going to exist

199
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,120
in the a b and f at all and it's not

200
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,200
going to have the historical note

201
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,600
it's just gonna we're gonna make believe

202
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,800
source routing

203
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,599
didn't exist

204
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,600
or were going for

205
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,320
allow it in the abn f but make no

206
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,519
mention of it whatsoever

207
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,640
right the option that was presented by

208
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,399
alexi on the list and the one that

209
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,600
seemed to

210
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,760
gain consensus was that the document

211
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,600
should be stripped of all mentioning of

212
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
handling of source routes in text and

213
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,519
abnf other than to specify their

214
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,279
historical use

215
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,480
in rfc 821 and point to rfc 821 for

216
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,920
implementations that want to implement

217
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,399
them for backward compatibility

218
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,519
so

219
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,839
every

220
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,480
slide regarding this text um

221
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,600
regarding

222
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
every slide regarding this option that

223
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,760
comes afterwards

224
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,360
seems to be in support of option b not

225
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,040
option a despite

226
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,120
it's saying it's in support of option a

227
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,839
um

228
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,120
so

229
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,880
let's revisit this this slide here with

230
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,959
the the various options and it seems

231
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,640
like

232
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,360
the recollection

233
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
of everyone from the mailing list is it

234
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
option a was where people expressed a

235
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,720
preference

236
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,399
um so

237
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,079
yes they answered your question that we

238
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,040
would be stripping the info out

239
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,439
barry

240
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,680
barry lee but so the in in which case

241
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,399
there should be text somewhere that says

242
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,120
that has a paragraph that says

243
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,399
um

244
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,680
smtp originally specified source routing

245
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,120
uh c here in rfc 821

246
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,000
um this has now this is now deprecated

247
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,680
and implementations that need to use

248
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,600
need to have backward compatibility with

249
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,760
source routing should see

250
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,839
that

251
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,680
for um

252
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,320
for syntax or whatever and that's it and

253
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,639
then every place else we're pulling the

254
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,519
text

255
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,760
right

256
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,680
that seems to be the

257
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,638
proposal on the floor yes

258
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,560
elliott

259
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,240
hey uh good morning good afternoon good

260
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,360
evening to everybody um uh forgive me

261
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,839
for uh jumping in but

262
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:46,880
um

263
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,519
i i i just like to express a preference

264
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,320
for the more traditional approach of

265
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,600
must not be generated maybe parsed

266
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,160
uh approach because for the reason for

267
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,079
the very reason that um

268
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,680
john put into

269
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,160
the uh

270
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
the chat which is you know you you

271
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,800
certainly want to be able to parse uh

272
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,959
historical mailboxes there i think

273
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,639
people have some some people have

274
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,320
archives that are large some people that

275
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
are small and i really would like to

276
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,000
understand the harm

277
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,040
that would be incurred by allowing for

278
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,639
the the previous reference

279
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,760
when you use the term previous reference

280
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,440
you're referring to allowing source

281
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,839
routing and strengthening the existing

282
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,800
i'm sorry this is the you're saying the

283
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,600
smtp command stream

284
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,560
pete say more i'm sorry

285
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,839
right the parsers are the

286
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,560
the the the parsing of the return

287
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,839
button

288
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,079
so sorry the parsing return route occurs

289
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,800
in both the smtp command stream and it

290
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,800
also can be found sometimes in the uh

291
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,360
what the return path slash

292
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,959
what what people call the from space

293
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,199
header right

294
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,800
so it can be it can be in all three

295
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,639
places now obviously some of that is in

296
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,320
53 22 right or more might be referenced

297
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,680
in 5322 but i'm just saying

298
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,199
it

299
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,120
i don't i don't see the harm in saying

300
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,480
if you want to if you want to parse it

301
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,920
you can parse it just don't generate it

302
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,279
pete you started to speak and then i'll

303
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,920
get to you john

304
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,120
yeah this yeah

305
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,720
i was just gonna

306
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,760
uh

307
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,880
try and respond to elliot um

308
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,320
i i was checking to see whether it's in

309
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,279
the

310
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,240
parse

311
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,040
syntax from

312
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,040
5322

313
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,600
um

314
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,720
but

315
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,000
yeah i mean in 5321 we're talking about

316
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,480
the smtp command stream not parsing old

317
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,440
mailboxes right

318
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,279
john shakes his head

319
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,519
go ahead and go ahead

320
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,760
we we we vote both

321
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,600
53-21 and 5322

322
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,040
and their ancient and esteemed

323
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,480
predecessors

324
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,240
are about what gets transmitted over the

325
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,680
wire

326
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
we never specify what somebody can put

327
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,600
in an envelope

328
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,360
uh it can put it in a mailbox file

329
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,560
uh and uh and nothing prevents someone

330
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,480
from putting parts of the envelope in

331
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,720
the in that file along with parts of the

332
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,120
content and and i've certainly seen it

333
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,160
done

334
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,959
so

335
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,480
yes it has to do with parsing mailboxes

336
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,720
uh we wouldn't want somebody who's

337
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
trying to look at an old mailbox

338
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,880
to find one of these ugly looking

339
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,600
creatures and say

340
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,959
wtf is that um

341
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,800
so

342
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,680
elliott's scheme works ned's scheme

343
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,800
works

344
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,920
uh

345
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,320
taking all of this out and pretending

346
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,160
that it never happened

347
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,680
probably doesn't work and uh and it's

348
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,440
exactly this discussion which is why i

349
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,600
made the comment earlier about wanting

350
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,399
to make certain that uh that

351
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,560
people are clear to me about what it is

352
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,240
they want and then check and make

353
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,120
certain they get it right

354
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,720
so

355
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,480
let let's be clear about 53 22's

356
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,920
approach to this stuff because 5322 is

357
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,519
about parsing

358
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,560
messages wherever they may be and so

359
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,199
there is explicit text saying hey if

360
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,199
you've got this stuff locally stored and

361
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,839
you've got a message locally stored

362
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,560
you may want to be able to parse that

363
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,680
um and so there is

364
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,400
the

365
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,199
route you know this uh

366
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,199
return path um it's called obs route in

367
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,679
5322

368
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,799
that makes it legitimate to parse it in

369
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,439
a message but 5321 as far as i can tell

370
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,119
isn't talking about that it's talking

371
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,000
about the use of them

372
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,960
in protocol

373
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,960
and specifically the use of them in

374
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,400
receipt twos in mail froms

375
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,360
and

376
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,000
so it seems legitimate to say we're not

377
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,600
going to do

378
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,679
some sort of old-fashioned

379
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,960
stuff

380
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,799
in 5321 and yet leave it in 53 22 for

381
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,480
parsing purposes

382
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,440
for

383
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,600
messages that exist wherever they might

384
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,200
exist

385
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,679
except for one problem page

386
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,160
which is that there is no text in 5322

387
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,919
which says

388
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,039
uh when you're storing this stuff for

389
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,600
uh for further use

390
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,679
you are forbidden to put anything there

391
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,440
which 5322

392
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,360
doesn't say

393
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,840
uh and

394
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,919
and while you're absolutely correct

395
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,360
about

396
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,919
the things from the envelope which are

397
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,320
record or extracted in the envelope

398
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,039
which are recorded in 5322 headers

399
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,080
um

400
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,919
uh received deals return pads whatever

401
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,280
uh

402
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,160
nowhere do you say well if somebody put

403
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,960
this stupid thing in the uh

404
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,440
um

405
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,120
in the in the x fufa field

406
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,080
um

407
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,799
given our history with that spoof

408
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,080
or the ex fufa or or the x expoof

409
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,360
command

410
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,520
given our history with that stuff

411
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,080
that they can't store it in the message

412
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,840
store

413
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,280
so

414
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,600
there's still an issue there

415
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,760
and it's that issue

416
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,160
won't try to speak for ned or elliot but

417
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,000
it's that issue which motivates me to

418
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,240
say there ought to be a backward pointer

419
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,840
here somewhere

420
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,240
and whether we state that backward

421
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,919
pointer by

422
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,799
putting into 5321 the thing which 532

423
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,919
does frequently and 5321 is so far

424
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,039
avoided

425
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,160
which is to say must not generate but

426
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,200
may do odd things with uc

427
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,240
which is my version of elliot's proposal

428
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,320
uh or uh or to take all of it out and

429
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,360
say

430
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,760
uh one of these bogus things looks like

431
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,880
this and uh and if you see one go look

432
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,240
at

433
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,280
um

434
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,400
eight twenty eight twenty one

435
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
which is nice which is my rough

436
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,039
interpretation that's proposal i i don't

437
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,039
see nearly as much difference between

438
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,679
the two as it probably feels like but

439
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,720
that's just me

440
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,919
and and since i've uh i'm here

441
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,679
i'll i'll mention the latter which

442
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,840
sounds more like choice a to me

443
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,960
seems to be my preference which is no

444
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,600
real mention of source routing in 5321

445
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,480
bits

446
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,400
except for the backward pointer to 821

447
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,039
uh as as as editor i'm completely

448
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,360
agnostic as anything but editors too

449
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,760
early in the morning

450
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,559
okay

451
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,320
uh anyone else want to speak on this

452
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,559
topic

453
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,039
it seems to me that we've

454
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,440
landed back on option a um

455
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,360
does anyone disagree

456
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,919
that we have landed back on option a

457
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,080
well we're going to end it up without

458
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,159
watching with option a with the

459
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,520
understanding that's leaving that

460
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,159
historical pointer rather than

461
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,600
taking all of this out entirely and

462
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,879
pretending it never existed

463
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,960
i'm sorry say

464
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,600
say that again

465
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,640
option a variant one

466
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,280
is we take everything which

467
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,120
ever referred to these things out of the

468
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,480
document and pretend they never happened

469
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,360
option a variant two is we take all of

470
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,320
this out and we put in new text

471
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,799
uh in an appropriate place which said

472
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,640
that which says they used to be these

473
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,280
things and uh and if you encounter them

474
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,640
and need to figure out what they are go

475
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,360
look at a21

476
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,600
i don't understand how option a variant

477
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,760
two differs from

478
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,120
the option a that is showing on the

479
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,440
screen right now

480
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,799
ah

481
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,320
it because

482
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,640
i'm i'm i i'm going to make my usual

483
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,640
comment about being able to read what's

484
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,799
on the screen okay what's on the screen

485
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,360
for option a says b that uh source

486
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,880
routing should be stripped of all

487
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,640
mentioning of handling of source routing

488
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,039
in text and abnf other than to specify

489
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,799
their historical use in

490
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,640
rc 821

491
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,440
and yeah though

492
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,360
subject to subject to editors

493
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,120
interpretation the warning that editor

494
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,840
may get it wrong

495
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,880
option a in uh on the slide is uh is

496
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,280
what i refer to as variant two

497
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,159
okay

498
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,559
and that that was the option that was

499
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,240
seemed to seem to draw consensus on the

500
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,360
mailing list

501
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,960
uh that is not the option supported by

502
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,559
the follow-on slide but we will use the

503
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,320
follow-on slides to mention the text

504
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,039
that

505
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,720
will have to be stripped out

506
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,960
and

507
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,799
okay and and and i plead with you and

508
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,360
braun to make these notes clear enough

509
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,720
that when i look at them i don't get

510
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,200
confused

511
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,520
you can't be any more confused than i

512
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,559
right now so we will

513
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,840
well if

514
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,679
those clearly show the confusion that if

515
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,080
i get confused i'll go back to the list

516
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,240
okay

517
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,679
all right

518
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,919
so

519
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,480
okay

520
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,400
moving on

521
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,520
now these slides that address the topic

522
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,360
of source routing will be used to

523
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,960
reference the sections that need to be

524
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,720
stripped in keeping with option a rather

525
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,000
than

526
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,840
proposing alternative text which would

527
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,679
be key in keeping with option b which we

528
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,320
did not agree to

529
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,320
so

530
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,360
we have a sentence in basic structure

531
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,279
that says explicit sort source writing

532
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,720
should not be used

533
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,039
that sentence will be stripped

534
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,320
we have a sentence in mail transactions

535
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,159
that

536
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,919
finishes with the clauses however

537
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,279
contemporary system should not use

538
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,240
source routings the appendix c

539
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,520
that clause will be stripped

540
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,799
um

541
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,559
another section or another paragraph in

542
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,918
the mail transactions section

543
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,360
i don't know if

544
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,120
the sentence historically the forward

545
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,720
path was permitted to contain a source

546
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,039
routing list of hosts qualifies as

547
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,760
referencing its previous existence but

548
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,039
this is a sentence that will have to be

549
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,159
addressed

550
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,679
as the editor

551
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,720
rolls out a new version

552
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,919
i appreciate that there's a conversation

553
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,520
going on in the chat but if it's a

554
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,880
conversation that

555
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,320
the audience might benefit from please

556
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,520
feel free to step up to the mic

557
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,240
another sentence in the ninth paragraph

558
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,880
on mail transactions

559
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,159
discussing source routing and

560
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,440
ignoring them this is a

561
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,400
this is another sentence that will have

562
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,159
to be addressed or dealt with

563
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,120
more text on source routing in fact an

564
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,960
entire section on source routing and

565
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,520
relaying

566
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,520
the point here these slides is i think

567
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,200
alexi did a good job of calling out all

568
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,440
the areas or all the sections in the

569
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,039
document that talk about the topic of

570
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,880
source writing so they're

571
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,600
they're the ones that will have to be

572
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,799
stricken and

573
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,720
references to 821 made as appropriate

574
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,080
more text that talks about source

575
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,760
routing in section 4.1.1.3

576
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,880
74.1.2

577
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,120
appendix c

578
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,000
discussing source routes

579
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,840
interesting question elliot regarding

580
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,880
possible reply to seeing a source route

581
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,400
that's not

582
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,600
i don't know that that's a topic that's

583
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,400
been discussed um but

584
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,840
elliot's question in chat is the

585
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,360
expectation here is seeing a source

586
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,360
route is a 500

587
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,559
um that

588
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,720
is a topic worthy of discussion i think

589
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,000
either today or on the list

590
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,799
well i would say that um it's like any

591
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,520
other

592
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,679
malformed

593
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,200
uh route

594
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,279
it's yes it's a 500.

595
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,240
john

596
00:26:59,039 --> 00:26:59,919
well

597
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,640
if if you don't say anything about it

598
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,159
for people to say hi there's a school

599
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,640
tax error then it gets any sort of 500

600
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,720
thing just this was mentioned

601
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,799
if you decide to stay

602
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,440
if you see a source route generate a 5

603
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,200
yz error

604
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,799
then we haven't removed all this text in

605
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,399
the document we specify what to do with

606
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,279
using one and that's exactly where all

607
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,559
this is fuzzy in my mind

608
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,720
okay

609
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,640
what i started to say in the chat is i

610
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,240
think i

611
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,840
understand how to write the historical

612
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,440
paragraph

613
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,399
and

614
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,320
maybe the right way to most efficiently

615
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,600
move forward

616
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,480
is we write it to get it into dash 06

617
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,000
and then have people start throwing

618
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,760
things when they see it it doesn't

619
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,120
correspond with what they think they

620
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,879
they thought i should have met

621
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,120
that seems like a good approach

622
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,840
and uh and from that standpoint this set

623
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,000
of slides to tell you prepared and which

624
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,640
for the record i've seen first time now

625
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,840
uh is simply a pointer for me

626
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,880
as to what to look at and take out

627
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,880
correct

628
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,320
more reference to authentic c

629
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,960
and appendix f.2

630
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,679
well this may be some starter text for

631
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,000
the reference to rfc 821 that we're

632
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,559
talking about

633
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,760
it uh it it it isn't without more

634
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,039
context and uh but my assumption is that

635
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,960
i ultimately replaced

636
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,120
one of these two appendices

637
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,840
more likely see that f.2 but i'll think

638
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,200
about it

639
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,480
with uh with that historical note

640
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,640
i was i was using the phrase starter

641
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,200
text and the

642
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,799
minimal definition

643
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,000
you know that

644
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,200
that that's fine but but my but my

645
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,679
understanding

646
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,559
from

647
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,880
the discussion we've had so far is that

648
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,320
i'm

649
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,240
using this as pointers and discarding

650
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,120
most of the lexi's suggestions what we

651
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,559
do about them

652
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,039
yes that's correct

653
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,960
that's my interpretation as well if

654
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,080
anybody else has a different

655
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,199
interpretation please speak up

656
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,480
okay

657
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,000
we have completed our discussion of

658
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
source routing i hope

659
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,840
and now i can move on to

660
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,399
other tickets

661
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,640
there are two tickets um

662
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,120
that reference quoted strings

663
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,600
an email comparison uh tickets 21 and

664
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,440
49.

665
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,760
um

666
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,559
there is a suggestion here

667
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,919
to

668
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,600
add a bit to the end of the

669
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,919
reference paragraph and command argument

670
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:30,960
syntax

671
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,799
that provides some examples of local

672
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,880
parts that are semantically equivalent

673
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,679
uh just with

674
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,880
some some white space in them

675
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,880
does anyone have anything

676
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,760
to

677
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,080
say in support or opposition to the

678
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,320
suggested edition of that example text

679
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,399
um

680
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,559
just a cautionary note

681
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:08,960
um

682
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,109
[Music]

683
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,640
the the general tone of uh

684
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,240
of everything mate 21 forward toward

685
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,559
uh local parts

686
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,039
uh is that they don't have semantics and

687
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,960
nothing smtp is

688
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,399
gets involved with anything which

689
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,559
involves their semantics

690
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,600
so

691
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,000
the principle here is what i'm in favor

692
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,039
of the

693
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,720
the terminology

694
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,039
i think needs to be tweaked although

695
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,240
that's not the case people should

696
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,799
correct me

697
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,919
we're not talking about semantic

698
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,279
equivalence we're really talking about

699
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,279
lexical equivalence

700
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,600
okay

701
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,279
there is a mention from ned in the chat

702
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,880
about the most the really important

703
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,519
example was that quote foo quote at

704
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,679
example.com is the same as food

705
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,320
example.com

706
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,559
certainly

707
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,000
examples illustrating the point i don't

708
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,880
think are

709
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,519
are bad things

710
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,399
yeah no i i i agree and uh

711
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,360
and we'll try to put some in and again

712
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,320
uh

713
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,679
the key change here is uh

714
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,000
um

715
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,679
is is

716
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,399
is what is now stated as

717
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,720
i should use minimal quoting possible

718
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,640
and if i had my brothers we'd say must

719
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,720
there too as well

720
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,559
that's a personal editorial comment

721
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,519
okay

722
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,679
less hardcore mentioning many other

723
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,600
specifications discuss comparisons after

724
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,679
conversion to economical form

725
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,600
but i

726
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,519
assume less that you're saying that this

727
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,279
is something that's done and

728
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,559
it's something that we should put in the

729
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,399
document in this document as well

730
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,760
well i was giving an alternative i'm

731
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,919
sorry this is a long time mail user

732
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,760
first time caller i don't follow the

733
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,480
email groups in the atf enough but

734
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,000
um you know i work with a lot of other

735
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,519
specifications including dns and other

736
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,519
things where

737
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,200
the process of doing comparisons

738
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,320
involves

739
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,399
doing all the replacements to convert

740
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,880
something down to a canonical form that

741
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,039
is the basis for comparison so on the

742
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,120
screen for example you know you would

743
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,240
handle the escaping uh for the you know

744
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,799
food example.com you would convert one

745
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,000
or the other

746
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,159
to you know the base form that would

747
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,080
probably strip the quotes or keep them

748
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,320
um and then you do the comparison and

749
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,000
that's that's typical that's one way

750
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,760
that we put wording in iets

751
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,360
specifications about

752
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,880
things like this

753
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,120
yeah well it's it's it's a matter of

754
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,960
wording i'm a little reluctant to go

755
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,919
there

756
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,159
to go in that direction here

757
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,320
because the potential interactions with

758
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,000
uh with sftput have aided its friends

759
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,960
where

760
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,320
because of

761
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,760
in my judgment it might have been your

762
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,440
badge you're not judgment on unicode's

763
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,760
part canonical form means a whole lot of

764
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,199
other things

765
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,040
and and those things include things

766
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,480
which we specifically do not want mta's

767
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,399
messing with

768
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,079
so this is a canonical form strictly

769
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,079
with regard to quoting and i think that

770
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,560
gets us tangled into knots although

771
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,239
certainly we've tried that in other

772
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,239
places

773
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,639
okay

774
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,480
related to this topic the next slide

775
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,159
recommends

776
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,560
moving some text uh

777
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,079
the the mention right now in the current

778
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,719
document of the backslash comes after

779
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,719
uh the text on the previous slide that

780
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,639
uses the backslash and there's there's a

781
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,920
recommendation here to move this

782
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,359
paragraph

783
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,839
uh regarding the backslash and its usage

784
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,680
before that so that it sort of flows

785
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,119
better

786
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,720
talk about the talk about the the

787
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,079
character before you use its first

788
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,560
example sort of thing

789
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,800
the the editor apologizes for not fixing

790
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,040
this in 2821

791
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,920
the apology is accepted i guess

792
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,880
any any other comments on this

793
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,200
particular

794
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,200
topic

795
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,200
okay

796
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,078
moving on to the next

797
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,079
topic um in the abstract is the

798
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,750
paragraph shown here um

799
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,800
[Music]

800
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,720
and the the highlighted text in that

801
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,960
abstract is a

802
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,160
discussion of mail submission protocol

803
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,160
um

804
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,520
there's a suggestion to replace that

805
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,119
bolded text with the

806
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,800
sentence the document also provides

807
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,880
information about use of smtp for other

808
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,160
than strict mail transport and delivery

809
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,040
the the explanation here is that we will

810
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,200
begin to get us is as i tried to tune

811
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,800
the abstract to match the changes we're

812
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,880
making text and the existence of

813
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,280
submission protocols

814
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,480
um

815
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,480
i i was afraid of making the extra much

816
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,640
longer getting us tied in knots

817
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,200
so this is a is an attempt at

818
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,359
saying the same mostly the same thing

819
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,760
but but minimizing the side references

820
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,960
especially the abstract

821
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,759
right

822
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,079
anyone have thoughts to offer on this

823
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,839
okay

824
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,119
moving on

825
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,839
i'm taking silence's approval talk

826
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,040
so am i

827
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,560
okay

828
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,760
that or everybody's going off to get

829
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,040
another cup of coffee i'm not sure

830
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,640
uh informative references to mime

831
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,000
and or message submission ticket 53.

832
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,760
the suggestion here is to not mention

833
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,320
mime at all in 5321 perhaps mention it

834
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,160
in 5322

835
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,160
or even the

836
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,160
hand wavy other relevant documents in

837
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,440
their relationships are discussed in the

838
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,800
forthcoming applicability statement

839
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,320
says this is already mentioned in 5322

840
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,839
bis that's good

841
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
yeah part part of what i'm trying to do

842
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,480
here is to uh

843
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,480
um there's been some extensive offline

844
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,079
discussion about this

845
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,320
uh i'm i'm

846
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,359
i'm confident that we are going to

847
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,240
uh finish the as and finish the ass in a

848
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,520
timely

849
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,359
way with the content we are now

850
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,200
expecting it to have

851
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,200
but there are no guarantees about any of

852
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,240
that

853
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,119
and i want to

854
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,200
minimize references in 5321 to the as

855
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,800
especially references let's talk about

856
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,560
specifically what's in it

857
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,400
so my goal is to drop is is to

858
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,200
reference the as 53 21

859
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,599
but to make the reference approp make

860
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,119
make as few separate references as

861
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,280
possible and make them appropriately

862
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,560
vague and this

863
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,560
this sentence is my candidate for

864
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,759
appropriately vague at the moment

865
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,440
in particular things blow up and the uh

866
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,280
and the ass doesn't happen

867
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,320
the worst thing 5321 this has said it's

868
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,480
forthcoming applicability statement it

869
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,920
has not committed anything about what

870
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,280
has to be there

871
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,839
or when

872
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,359
i definitely i i personally like

873
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,839
the

874
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,000
um phrasing here because as you said it

875
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,079
is purposefully vague

876
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,320
um

877
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,200
it makes lots of promises without making

878
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,240
anything specific so

879
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,680
the chat seems to agree

880
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,760
okay

881
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,079
moving on

882
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,200
this slide is in regards to

883
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,760
the forthcoming applicability statement

884
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,560
and which

885
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,760
which mentions

886
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,119
should

887
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,079
as far as compliance with the

888
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,359
applicability statement which of these

889
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,920
protocols must be compliant or must

890
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,280
be supported and which should be

891
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,400
supported

892
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,240
uh we do know that there is some

893
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,640
difference uh in this proposal here with

894
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,359
what's in 6409 because all five of these

895
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,160
are shoulds or four of these are sheds

896
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,279
in 6409 at the moment

897
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,359
if in the applicability statement it

898
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:26,800
says you must support 8-bit mime and

899
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,880
must support enhanced reply codes and

900
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,640
must support dsns and should support

901
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,280
pipelining and should support smt

902
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,880
utf-8

903
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,280
is that something the group

904
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,040
can get behind or

905
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,520
is there opposition to phrasing things

906
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,920
that way

907
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,800
uh i would say get behind with the

908
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
understanding that when we start

909
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,640
seriously addressing the as we we're

910
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,800
going to review these decisions anyway

911
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,560
uh the short-term scoop from my

912
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,480
standpoint is making certain that

913
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,839
there's no

914
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,280
strong argument for saying anything

915
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,119
about any of this in 53-21 biz

916
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,480
right

917
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,920
because some of the mailing lists

918
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,680
discussion implied they were actually

919
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,560
he'll say this in 53 21 this and and

920
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,160
this particular approach says we're not

921
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,599
going to do that

922
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,720
thank you for the clarification john

923
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,400
and then i agree and i agree for

924
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,920
multiple reasons including the fact that

925
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,160
8-bit mine is a strict requirement for

926
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,800
smtp utf-8

927
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,000
which

928
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
yeah

929
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,680
does anyone think that these should be

930
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,920
discussed in 5321 this and not in the

931
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,480
applicability statement

932
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,200
now that's your most recent comment i

933
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,200
think that's as john was saying earlier

934
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,880
that's something we can better discuss

935
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,079
once the applicability statement is

936
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,079
written

937
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,960
all right moving on to the next topic

938
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,359
this is

939
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,640
mention of changing one word uh in

940
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,839
section 3.9.2

941
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,000
uh there is uh

942
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,760
mentioned there is the use of the word

943
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,520
forwarding in the sentence

944
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,040
difference difference between handling

945
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,680
aliases and forwarding is the change

946
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,960
to the backward pointing address in this

947
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,400
case we believe this to be a cut and

948
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,040
paste error

949
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,480
and the word should be redistribution

950
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,960
there not forwarding

951
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,599
because

952
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,680
earlier mentioned of how melanis

953
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,880
operates it says they operate by

954
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,680
redistribution

955
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,400
and this proposed replacement is already

956
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,200
in

957
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,279
version six of 321 bis

958
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,359
yeah the stupid editor of 5321 was

959
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:08,800
obviously gonna be a bad day this is

960
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,280
just wrong

961
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,140
okay

962
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,240
[Music]

963
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,720
a little discussion on this topic

964
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,839
on the chat

965
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,480
i don't think

966
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,400
there's some discussion of a quick

967
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,400
update to 3461 on in the chat

968
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,920
uh the ticket 54 should hop by hop

969
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,920
authentication or encryption be

970
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,119
discussed in 5321

971
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,119
the proposal here is to address the

972
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,040
topics in the forthcoming applicability

973
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,480
statement

974
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,359
and to have initial text on these topics

975
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,200
available for discussion during a

976
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,640
possible interim in december

977
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,400
i open the floor to discussion on this

978
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,280
okay

979
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,680
see no discussion in the chat nobody in

980
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,160
the queue

981
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,720
seems like we will

982
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,920
have these topics discussed in the

983
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,200
forthcoming applicability statement

984
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,520
now regarding a possible interim in

985
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,079
december

986
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,280
alexi wanted to talk about having won

987
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,560
perhaps the week of december 6th to 10th

988
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,200
a time zone convenient for

989
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,839
east and west coast i apologize for the

990
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,839
typo

991
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,040
thank you ned i note your comments on

992
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,759
the previous slide

993
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,160
um

994
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,400
i think

995
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,730
today's session

996
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:16,960
[Music]

997
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,720
may illustrate the need to have this at

998
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,880
a time more convenient for u.s east

999
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,040
coast and west coast um

1000
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,920
it's currently 7 45

1001
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,920
a.m here on the east coast and i don't

1002
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,800
know 4 45 west coast so this seems a bit

1003
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,119
early

1004
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,599
our participation numbers aren't again

1005
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,760
what i thought they might be but

1006
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,440
uh does anyone

1007
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,359
feel strongly about

1008
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:42,960
having an interim or not having an

1009
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,440
interim on the week of december 6th the

1010
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,839
10th

1011
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,200
let me try this how many people would

1012
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,040
show up if there was an interim the week

1013
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,160
of december 6th to 10th

1014
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,400
yes barry

1015
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,200
to say i'll show up

1016
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,520
okay

1017
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,079
mr levine

1018
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,200
uh you're just

1019
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,800
joining the queue to say you'll show up

1020
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,000
and then leaving the queue is that

1021
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,640
what's going on here

1022
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,839
okay um

1023
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,400
seems to be support for interim

1024
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,880
yeah i i i i will show up and if we can

1025
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,560
can do an interim in december which is

1026
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,079
nearly as productive as this call has

1027
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,680
been so far

1028
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,200
we will be moving along very quickly

1029
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,040
which is a good thing

1030
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,839
okay

1031
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,440
so

1032
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,040
look for an announcement on the list

1033
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,079
soon regarding scheduling the interim

1034
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,839
i don't see anybody saying

1035
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,079
ron says he won't show up so

1036
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,079
but okay

1037
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,480
and then the last slide um suggested

1038
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,400
scope for the core applicability

1039
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,720
statement

1040
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,920
although anything with a question mark i

1041
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,520
don't even know that that's a suggestion

1042
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,520
but

1043
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,079
john i see you're still in the queue

1044
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,079
we have a comment in chat suggested

1045
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,119
scope looks about right

1046
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,400
this is the last slide in the deck so

1047
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,079
if anyone else is barry

1048
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,640
yes this suggested scope looks about

1049
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,720
right the um

1050
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,720
we are going as we build the

1051
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,800
applicability statement we are going to

1052
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,839
be suggesting specific things to put in

1053
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,000
and those details will get sorted out at

1054
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,200
the time

1055
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,760
but for setting expectations

1056
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,440
this statement seems about right

1057
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,839
okay

1058
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,800
john

1059
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,359
yes straight strictly as participant or

1060
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,040
other editor of anything that happens

1061
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,480
involved here

1062
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,720
uh i think we're gonna have

1063
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,559
trouble keeping some of these things out

1064
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,599
of there

1065
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,400
in practice in particular the uh the

1066
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,839
interconnections between uh

1067
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:44,400
6409 and uh and

1068
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,480
and nsmtp

1069
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,599
uh are are probably going to require

1070
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:50,720
comment

1071
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,119
but these are things which but but as as

1072
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,680
statements of principles and targets as

1073
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,520
barry suggested i think this is about

1074
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,440
right and we can sort it all out as we

1075
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,839
get

1076
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,680
there okay

1077
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,640
thank you ron

1078
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,280
yeah hi

1079
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,720
um

1080
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,359
it's it came up at the last atf the

1081
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,839
large files emailing problem

1082
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,839
um i have not prepared anything for this

1083
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,720
itf but at some point the dispatch

1084
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,079
outcome last time was that we were going

1085
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,520
to form a working group for that as well

1086
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,680
so that will probably also want to to

1087
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,520
deal with the email applicability

1088
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,040
statement at some point

1089
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,400
it won't be touched directly but we'll

1090
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,200
have to be aware of it

1091
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,920
what scope of the user what

1092
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,119
magnitude are they talking about when

1093
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,280
they say large files

1094
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,400
uh so they

1095
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,119
basically the large file problem is

1096
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,480
you've just taken a

1097
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,240
30 minute video with your iphone and you

1098
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,920
want to send it to someone

1099
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,400
via email or via any protocol that

1100
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,000
doesn't have the capability to send all

1101
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,520
of that yourself and so what we're

1102
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,440
winding up with is each provider having

1103
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,760
their own way of

1104
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,280
basically creating a url and then

1105
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,960
sticking that somewhere deep inside the

1106
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,920
email

1107
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,520
um

1108
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,079
in an html as an html link with with no

1109
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,359
context to say that this is an

1110
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,960
attachment or this is

1111
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,160
something that you might want to

1112
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,680
download and keep yourself at the other

1113
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,119
end there's something that might want to

1114
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,359
be virus checked

1115
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,920
on the way um so the

1116
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,920
the plan is to look at what can be done

1117
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,960
there

1118
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,200
but i did not get to do it in the four

1119
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,359
months since the last atf so at some

1120
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,480
point some group is going to have to

1121
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,839
handle this

1122
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,280
because the problem keeps getting bigger

1123
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,640
there are more and more

1124
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,400
cases of people wanting to send files to

1125
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,520
larger than

1126
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,960
you can send over smtp reliably

1127
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,839
thank you

1128
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,559
john levine

1129
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,119
yeah apropos of that particular

1130
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,240
comment

1131
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,200
um

1132
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,559
we actually we have most of the way to

1133
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,400
sketching out an improved version of

1134
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,400
external body which is an existing mime

1135
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,640
thing to make it slightly more robust so

1136
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,680
it

1137
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,440
so like it has a check summit it has a

1138
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,440
and it has a date so you can see you can

1139
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,480
um

1140
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,400
you can virus scan it when you when you

1141
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,760
receive the message and then look at the

1142
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,040
checksum to make sure it hasn't changed

1143
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,640
and stuff like that so i think it

1144
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,960
actually might wherever wherever we do

1145
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,559
mime updates that's where it should go i

1146
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,160
don't know whether that's 53.22 or

1147
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,879
that's something else

1148
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,160
okay

1149
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,240
ron you're still in the queue well that

1150
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,359
is the the storage component um

1151
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:26,720
that

1152
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,640
you need to need to define how it gets

1153
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,319
stored and how long it gets stored for

1154
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:31,280
and

1155
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,200
and whether the receiver takes a copy

1156
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,359
and maintains a copy locally as well so

1157
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:36,559
there'll be a bunch of work that's not

1158
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,280
just the mime format itself

1159
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,240
it'll be

1160
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,919
authentication and transport stuff

1161
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,240
good

1162
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,079
there's mentioned in the chat from pete

1163
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,000
about the lemonade specs

1164
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,240
and

1165
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:56,900
let's say

1166
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,320
[Music]

1167
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:02,880
mentioning past attempts to do something

1168
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,839
like this

1169
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,000
anyone else want to speak on the

1170
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,240
applicability statement or any other

1171
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,640
topic that is

1172
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,920
within the charter of this working group

1173
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,359
okay

1174
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,839
ron i see you're still in the queue

1175
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:34,400
okay ron has left the queue

1176
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,280
okay we reached the end of our slide

1177
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,280
deck

1178
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,680
seeing

1179
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,370
no one in the queue

1180
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:44,839
[Music]

1181
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:46,330
and nothing

1182
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,680
[Music]

1183
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,079
in the chat to prolong our meeting i

1184
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,160
think we can bring it to a close

1185
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,680
i'd like to thank everybody for showing

1186
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,599
up um

1187
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:57,680
look for further discussion on the

1188
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,319
working group email list obviously

1189
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:00,580
and

1190
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:01,839
[Music]

1191
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,599
thank you all for productive meeting and

1192
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,440
there'll be a note coming out soon about

1193
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,880
an interim in early december

1194
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,119
