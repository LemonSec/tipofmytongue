23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,680
and this is the idf 112.

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,880
we're going to get going now

25
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,600
if you could advance the slide but one

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,360
slide

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,720
i'd like to just review a few items

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,479
that we should note well in the

29
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,799
tradition of the ietf

30
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,320
and

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,439
start out by stating that

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,600
you know there's a whole uh collection

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,040
of uh

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,320
policies

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,119
that the ietf has established

36
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,119
and um

37
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,600
this basically uh will review some of

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,119
them at a high level

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,640
and most importantly

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,640
there are you know policies on whole

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,470
range of top topics here and

42
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,040
[Music]

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,360
of course by participating in the ietf

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,079
you agree to follow these processes and

45
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,640
policies that have been laid out

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,560
one that's

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,719
quite important is of course

48
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,960
if you are aware of

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,600
any ietf contribution that's covered by

50
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,759
patents or patent applications owned or

51
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,919
controlled by you or your sponsor that

52
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,959
that's a quite important topic in fact

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,840
to disclose earlier than later and the

54
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,319
ietf goes to great lengths to

55
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,800
identify what is meant by a contribution

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,120
and what is meant by participation

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,640
and

58
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,879
as a participant in our attendee to an

59
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,599
ietf activity you also acknowledge that

60
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,840
um any written audio video and

61
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,760
photographic records or communications

62
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,720
of meetings are going to be made public

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,280
yet on the on the other hand all of your

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,120
personal information that you provide

65
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,599
will be handled according to the privacy

66
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,760
policies of the ietf

67
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,120
and um

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,760
i i personally believe that this last

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,480
bullet is perhaps the most important

70
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,560
item to note well is that we really

71
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,560
encourage participants and attendees to

72
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,519
agree to be respectful to one another

73
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,720
as part of this community

74
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,800
of course if you have any questions

75
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,120
there uh we have links included in our

76
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,959

99
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,439
to see that

100
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,799
meat echo does

101
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,560
integrate

102
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,879
identify identification underneath your

103
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,040
video and underneath your audio when you

104
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,319
are participating so

105
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,439
let's get to the next slide

106
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,399
as you can see there are a whole range

107
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,759
of policies

108
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,720
should you

109
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,759
have any questions

110
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,759
and i definitely encourage you if you

111
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,919
have not read them before to uh

112
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,520
investigate them

113
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,560
at some point sooner than later

114
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,479
there's an ombudsman

115
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,479
for the ietf and of course

116
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,639
as working group chairs

117
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,080
and ads we also are happy to advise

118
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,919
next slide

119
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,960
you are here so you must have figured

120
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,680
out how to use meat echo

121
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,759
but if not maybe you've consulted these

122
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,840
slides

123
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,000
the uh

124
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,680
i think how you had it before was a

125
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,520
little better in terms of the

126
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,560
presentation right

127
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,800
yeah thank you very much um

128
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,600
the the great news also is meat echo um

129
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,759
integrates not only the blue sheets but

130
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,560
additionally um the chat or what used to

131
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,759
be uh considered you know i am or jabber

132
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,800
um and so uh we encourage you to make

133
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,199
use of that capability

134
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,639
um the other uh nice attribute is that

135
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,560
there are live minutes

136
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,800
uh meaning that they are shared and we

137
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,560
encourage you to collaborate in fact if

138
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,960
there is someone who would like to

139
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,919
offer their services to lead the minute

140
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,479
taking we would welcome hearing from you

141
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,840
um

142
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,680
i'll just pause here for a moment to see

143
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,759
if there's somebody who would like like

144
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,280
the honors

145
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,520
i will add at this point that normally

146
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,759
or up until this point uh ethan has

147
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,840
always done a fantastic job of doing

148
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,919
that and unfortunately he can't make it

149
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,639
this time so um

150
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,199
don't expect the vast quality good

151
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,199
quality minutes that we've had

152
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,440
previously unless you're willing to uh

153
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,319
to help create them

154
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,080
um

155
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,160

next slide

177

we have a light agenda

178
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,840
this session

179
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,599
but

180
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,280
we have

181
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,919
quite a few items coming to maturation

182
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,960
quite a few documents

183
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,400
the we will hear from pascal

184
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,560
both about the technologies draft and

185
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,400
the architecture draft

186
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,440
and

187
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,639
followed by

188
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,120
a draft that he has recently

189
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,960
submitted

190
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,000
an individual contribution uh which has

191
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,360
uh

192
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,919
aired in the debt net working group on

193
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,120
um

194
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,360
ipv6 options

195
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,639
and um

196
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,479
we will hear a summary of the latest

197
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,879
changes uh to the use cases document by

198
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,400
carlos bernardos and um

199
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,160
followed by an update on ldac's document

200
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,879
by niels morrow

201
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,560
and hopefully we'll have quite a bit of

202
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,440
time for open mic

203
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,560
over to you rick okay so um we as eve

204
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,800
said we've got a bunch of documents that

205
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,639
are um

206
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,120
now their status has changed since uh

207
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
the ietf111

208
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,319
so uh ldax is currently

209
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,360
in the iesg review and

210
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,520
i know some edits have been requested

211
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,759
and i know the author team has

212
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,560
made some changes so uh niels will go

213
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,559
through hopefully some of the

214
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,880
changes and why they were made and

215
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
whether they were substantive or not i

216
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
don't believe they were hence we are

217
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,360
still in iesg review obviously for those

218
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,599
of you less familiar with uh

219
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,279
the way a document moves through a

220
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,360
working group and through into the iesg

221
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,120
and off to become an rfc eventually

222
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,399
editorial changes uh requests for

223
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,440
comment from uh to come out of the iesg

224
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,680
review are normally handled at that

225
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,720
stage if there is a substantive problem

226
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,480
that means the document actually needs

227
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,720
to to really go back to be chewed over

228
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,040
by the working group then it will drop

229
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
back to being a normal working group

230
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,279
document but as we understand it at the

231
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,120
moment um

232
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,200
the comments reviewed as part of the

233
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,800
comments received as part of the isg

234
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,360
review for ldx have been uh

235
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,720
clarification

236
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,800
or minor updates

237
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,040
when niels if you have not read the

238
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,120
latest update of the ldx document please

239
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,440
pay attention to nielsen's presentation

240
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,640
about what has changed if you as a

241
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,160
member of the working group think that

242
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,760
the change is substantive and needs to

243
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,360
be um

244
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,760
properly uh looked at by the working

245
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,360
group that is your chance really to

246
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,800
raise that at the mic and say and say

247
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
otherwise the working group documents we

248
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,040
have at the moment is in no particular

249
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,000
order

250
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
the architecture document which pascal's

251
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,080
going to talk about

252
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,240
oam support for

253
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,399
raw technologies and the use cases

254
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,200
document they are still

255
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,800
not ready for isg unless the author team

256
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
wishes to to raise that

257
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,640
currently

258
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,440
again that is a working group

259
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,120
decision about whether it's ready for

260
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,560
review and that obviously that decision

261
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,040
will be taken to the list but it's worth

262
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,640
making sure that

263
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,120
you have read the latest drafts if any

264
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,040
of those have been updated

265
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,480
uh also we have after iet after the last

266
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,839
ietf meeting we have

267
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,480
adopted the industrial requirements uh

268
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,760
personal draft from sofia router sorry

269
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,360
ruta sophia and her team

270
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,200
that document has yet to be renamed

271
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,000
but it has been uh officially adopted uh

272
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,079
when it's renamed it will be draft ietf

273
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,160
raw industrial requirements

274
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,880
where there was some discussion about uh

275
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,640
crossover between that document and the

276
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,760
use cases document uh some content may

277
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,120
boil off into use cases uh there may be

278
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,440
some flow in the other direction as well

279
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,880
but that's the point of a working group

280
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,120
document so that's that's perfectly

281
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,399
normal

282
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,160
um

283
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,240
carlos bernardo still has his mech and

284
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,959
his joint selection raw mech drafts

285
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,880
which uh

286
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,240
as of the last ietf he was still working

287
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,320
on um i'm not sure if there's been any

288
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,959
updates i'm sure carlos can answer that

289
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,720
annoyingly while presenting i can't see

290
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,040
the jabber chat in case carl eve shout

291
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,880
if someone is if carlos has got a

292
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,720
comment about that but otherwise we're

293
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,320
we're not really looking at these at the

294
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,399
moment because uh carlos is still

295
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,600
working on them as far as i'm aware

296
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,760
so um

297
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,920
this is the status of the milestones as

298
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,480
they stood at the last ietf meeting

299
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,600
yeah i accidentally removed carlos from

300
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,760
the from the meeting queue please put

301
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,240
yourself back in that was not my intent

302
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,839
yes

303
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,120
um

304
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,920
and now i'm uh trying to figure out oh

305
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,760
here you are um

306
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,399
go ahead carlos

307
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,120
yeah so on the on the on the individual

308
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,480
drafts

309
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,440
i'm still working on some

310
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,200
new additions and i

311
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,959
in any case i would appreciate if any

312
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,639
any member from the working group can

313
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,000
provide some feedback of course that

314
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,800
will be greatly appreciated

315
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,880
but you're not asking for working group

316
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,399
adoption yet do you still want to do a

317
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,920
little bit more personal work on it

318
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,839
first is that right

319
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,800
yes

320
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,680
okay

321
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,440
that's fine that's fine

322
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,399
um so the the milestones as they stood

323
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,920
at the last ietf look like this uh on

324
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,040
the screen

325
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,720
so um

326
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,160
everything

327
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,800
green uh actually were new additions to

328
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,200
the milestones um

329
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,720
from

330
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,600
what stood before the last ietf meeting

331
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,680
uh the little ticks obviously mean we've

332
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,480
met that milestone which is great um the

333
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,839
ones with a red date

334
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,720
are

335
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,200
things which are slipping um

336
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,680
either we haven't even created the

337
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,040
document nobody has put forward a

338
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,839
personal draft to even begin adoption

339
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,680
for example the the last item on the

340
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,760
list which is a charter item for an

341
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,760
evaluation of existing itf tech and a

342
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,519
gap analysis document

343
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,920
um with good reason uh

344
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,680
the other ones are

345
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,320
dates we assigned at the last ietf

346
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,720
thinking oh we might have this ready but

347
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,040
obviously it is now november and they're

348
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,240
not ready

349
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,200
so

350
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,920
uh one of the discussions i think it's

351
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,440
probably worth having in the working

352
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,760
group particularly as we

353
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,440
um

354
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,880
get a presentation on most of these

355
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,480
documents is to discuss

356
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,160
when we should set a tentative date for

357
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,079
when we think these documents might be

358
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,000
ready

359
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,560
i understand it will be a guess

360
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,680
but a guess is better than having a

361
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,320
milestone that is blatantly wrong

362
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,600
um

363
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,120
if you look at the milestones on the

364
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,880
data tracker you'll see that uh some of

365
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,399
uh there are more on this list than

366
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,560
there are officially uh signed off by

367
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,480
john scudder rad

368
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,560
reason being is that john quite rightly

369
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,480
looked at some of the dates proposed at

370
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,320
the last ietf meeting

371
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,240
uh and the current date

372
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,040
and uh raised the question of whether we

373
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,959
were being a bit ambitious or whether

374
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,480
the dates were just

375
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,560
unrealistic so

376
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,720
i would like to think collectively we

377
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,600
can answer his questions and if we can

378
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,839
assign a slightly better estimate on

379
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,360
when these documents

380
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,639
are going to be

381
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,920
expected to be ready then

382
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,600
we can adjust the date on the milestone

383
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,040
on the data tracker and john can

384
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,440
hopefully click the accept button i

385
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,600
don't think and john feel free to step

386
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,760
forwards and tell us we're wrong but i

387
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,079
don't think there's

388
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,920
any question of whether the milestone is

389
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,279
valid or not

390
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,040
the question is whether

391
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,480
we can achieve it at the date we

392
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,680
assigned

393
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,680
so

394
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,680
the critical ones just to recap our the

395
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,600
use cases the technologies the

396
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,000
industrial requirements the architecture

397
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,959
and

398
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,240
uh

399
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,680
the oam

400
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,959
document

401
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:21,920
so

402
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,360
um

403
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,959
we're not hearing about the industrial

404
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,040
requirements because having spoken

405
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,800
offline with the industrial requirements

406
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,480
or the team they want to do a bit of

407
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,040
work they've had a busy summer

408
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,399
and

409
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,959
haven't had a chance to to work much on

410
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,759
it

411
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,210
so

412
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,279
[Music]

413
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,720
in my opinion with my chair hat on i

414
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,959
think it will be after the use cases

415
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,360
document so if we can get a good date

416
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,759
for the use cases document or a guess

417
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,079
for a date for the use cases document i

418
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,720
would be happy to add two three months

419
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
to that and then say the industrial

420
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,800
requirements document is probably ready

421
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,240
at that point

422
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,120
um

423
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,000
any comment from the floor on that as a

424
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,920
as a way forwards

425
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,880
just check the chat as well and john is

426
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,639
saying that he does agree regarding the

427
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,920
milestones

428
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,360
yeah just spotted that brilliant thank

429
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,399
you john

430
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,000
so uh

431
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,240
i'm clicking next in the wrong window

432
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,480
sorry

433
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,720
uh okay so uh

434
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,800
pretty much on time um over to the

435
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,199
presentations on drafts now i know

436
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,519
pascal you've got a clash today and you

437
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,360
are jumping between

438
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,800
raw and

439
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,440
somewhere else so um

440
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,639
it's up to you to keep an eye on the

441
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,800
time but

442
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,720
please please please be aware of asking

443
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,040
questions

444
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,079
yeah it should be good don't worry i

445
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,199
will be speaking on at best uh in 90

446
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,519
minutes well now it's more like an hour

447
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,240
but

448
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,079
i guess we have one part time

449
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,279
okay so go ahead

450
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,040
okay are you okay are you okay to

451
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,720
present the slides or do you want me to

452
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
you want i would prefer that you just

453
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,480
call them if you don't mind

454
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,360
no problem

455
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,959
stop sharing that

456
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,280
yeah

457
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,599
oh this user interface confuses me at

458
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,159
times

459
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,799
um

460
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,760
well

461
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,720
otherwise

462
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,559
i can bring them up as well

463
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,760
okay

464
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,640
so yes let's start by the architecture

465
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,120
um please next slide

466
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,080
so as you know this document uh covers

467
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,240
two things by the title it has

468
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,559
architecture and framework and that's

469
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,360
kind of a a bit confusing because the

470
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,600
architecture is something that you you

471
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,360
do at the beginning here is what i want

472
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,880
to build

473
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,200
and your your other main directions and

474
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,720
how it's going to work

475
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,679
and the framework is more here is what

476
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,960
we built

477
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,000
and

478
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
here are the components that we put

479
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,880
together and how they are assembled

480
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,280
and so the architecture piece is really

481
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,200
something that you do ahead of time and

482
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,360
the framework is more something you do

483
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,880
whether at the end

484
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,039
and because this document has both um

485
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,480
it's very hard to say that we are going

486
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,840
to ship it

487
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,440
uh very early

488
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,880
because we don't really know for

489
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,559
instance the answers of

490
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,120
how exactly oem is gonna work

491
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,000
so if if really we we care about

492
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,480
producing the architecture and

493
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,320
uh shipping it

494
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,039
uh early because as you said uh we

495
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,840
should ship this month

496
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,000
um then i was wondering

497
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,919
if we would consider

498
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,520
actually splitting into architecture on

499
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,880
the one hand

500
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,039
and framework which would we would

501
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,039
deliver pretty much when we closed the

502
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,799
working goal

503
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,240
as you know here is what we did the

504
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,840
result works there all the components

505
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,320
here you know data came from here there

506
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,120
that net and and here is how they

507
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,880
assemble

508
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,640
because i just don't see that we can

509
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,960
shape architecture and framework you

510
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,600
know before very late in the process so

511
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,080
so that's basically a question to you

512
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,960
rick

513
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,000
and

514
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,039
eve um just so looking

515
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,640
looking at the charter

516
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,600
i actually agree with you um because as

517
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,919
you as you say the architecture has to

518
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,720
to precede the uh the framework

519
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,120
logically um and

520
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,039
the charter as i

521
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,520
read it and understand it is

522
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,280
in this phase of the working group's

523
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,240
lifetime we should be exploring

524
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,360
uh the problem space uh defining what we

525
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,200
see the problems to be

526
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,360
analyzing the available technologies

527
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,840
that exist within the ietf and at the

528
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,280
link layers

529
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,080
and

530
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,679
um

531
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,640
oh

532
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,799
and that's pretty much it and and maybe

533
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,720
the framework as a proposal of how we

534
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,240
could proceed

535
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,720
kind of covers the end of this working

536
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,360
group cycle and would be a great

537
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,039
starting point if when we recharter so

538
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,200
if you don't mind splitting the document

539
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,840
from a from a text perspective

540
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,520
then

541
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
it's already structured pretty much that

542
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,360
way i already restructured at the

543
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,240
previous publication to resize uh start

544
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,600
with architecture and then put the

545
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,880
framework

546
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,799
as the second piece so splitting should

547
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,919
be easy

548
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:30,720
uh

549
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,120
rather though

550
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,200
the question really will be with lou uh

551
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,600
you know lou wants to to

552
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,679
to do some important changes and we'll

553
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,919
have to see how luana can collaborate to

554
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,760
to get make that happen

555
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,600
uh following you know what lou wants to

556
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,559
achieve

557
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,320
but as we do that i mean splitting

558
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,799
document is no big worry

559
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:51,679
um

560
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,440
the the other question will be

561
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,200
how should i proceed should i just for

562
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,440
instance cut it in two just like it

563
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,880
stands today

564
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
and and so consider that both documents

565
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,640
are adopted or

566
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,900
do i need to to

567
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,200
[Music]

568
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,880
restart the second half as a personal

569
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,720
document

570
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,960
very quickly before i let lou jump in i

571
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,480
would i don't see a given that

572
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,240
the working group kind of owns the the

573
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,600
complete document i don't see any reason

574
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,400
to

575
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,039
reject the framework parts and push it

576
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,280
back to you as a personal draft why not

577
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,919
just keep it adopted it we seem to

578
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,320
that's too much process i unless

579
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,840
somebody

580
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,520
think well even if somebody does think

581
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,600
there's a problem uh it the text has

582
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
already been adopted even if we split

583
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,159
the text into two documents so right it

584
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,000
seems like an unnecessary step i think

585
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,400
we should assume it's already adopted

586
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,919
um however i can see that there are a

587
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,919
couple people in the queue

588
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,159
um lou would you like to go ahead and

589
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,559
comment

590
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,080
you're a little low for me i think you

591
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,000
said ask if i wanted a comment sorry yes

592
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,720
wrong

593
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,320
okay oh now you're great by the way um

594
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,039
so just going to pascal's

595
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,360
reference to the comments that i have i

596
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,039
think these are comments not only from

597
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,440
me but from others and so really would

598
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,400
welcome if others would uh interested in

599
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,360
joining

600
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,640
helping get the text there but basically

601
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
the root of the comment is is that the

602
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,520
current architecture document is missing

603
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,280
the cross layer optimization or

604
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,840
multi-layer optimization

605
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,840
that is

606
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,159
covered in much of the

607
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,600
teas work and the internet sort of

608
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,760
traffic engineering principles where you

609
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,679
can have cooperating

610
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,480
network layers that don't that each do

611
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,679
their own optimization as opposed to

612
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,559
a single integrated optimization

613
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,679
approach

614
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,799
that's really important when you have

615
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,799
one set of technology or one set of

616
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,240
operators

617
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,840
supporting another set of operators for

618
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,159
example if we were running debt net over

619
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,960
a 5g network we wouldn't necessarily

620
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,240
expect unless you're the 5g operator

621
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,760
that you would be able to have full

622
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,320
access to the 5g network you know there

623
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,120
was a liaison from

624
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,799
what was it a year ago or more where the

625
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,880
three gpe said here's here are the type

626
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,039
of parameters you can expect across a 5g

627
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,799
service interface

628
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,919
um and and those would not facilitate or

629
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,799
support this type of um raw architecture

630
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,440
that's being shown here so it's really

631
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,280
the comment that i made a while ago and

632
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,720
i think resonated with others is we

633
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,080
really need to bring in the concept of

634
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,240
multi-layer um and part of that is

635
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,320
supporting uh use of dlap to support

636
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,559
that and if there's others who want to

637
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,159
work on it i think we should you know

638
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,000
start setting up some maybe calls so we

639
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,520
can get some progress on this rather

640
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,159
than just be held up by by me

641
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,600
not doing the writing assignment that i

642
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,120
said i would do

643
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,039
which you know of course is

644
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,520
not a good thing so i apologize for that

645
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,400
uh that's it thank you

646
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,679
can i react to this uh sure

647
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,760
that's that's perfect i mean i've seen

648
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,360
that that there is something that they

649
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,000
they do very well uh on the case in the

650
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,559
case of oam for instance they

651
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,039
they have this periodic meeting

652
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,200
uh where anybody can join so it doesn't

653
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,640
look like a tiger team or something

654
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,880
anybody can join but still it's a

655
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,279
dedicated periodic meeting organized by

656
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,520
that net so you see janos in particular

657
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,240
attending the oaf one and and we do

658
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,400
great progress and oem thanks to this

659
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,760
organization

660
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,640
so if you don't mind having raw um you

661
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,120
know being shepherding this kind of

662
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,640
activity as well for the cross layer

663
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,240
or the architecture or the cross layer

664
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
piece of the architecture i really think

665
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,919
we could progress a lot more than you

666
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:48,640
know

667
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,320
the way we do it today

668
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,600
okay so

669
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,919
strongly with you

670
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,039
yeah so

671
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,400
that's definitely something the chairs

672
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,360
can can arrange i mean

673
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,840
we have the facility to set up uh

674
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,679
interims are really cheap

675
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,679
so being able to set up meet echo you

676
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,840
know once every two three weeks or

677
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,080
whatever a sprint needs to be

678
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,760
um to just have a a quick focused

679
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,600
meeting on how are we going in the right

680
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,360
direction how are people doing that's

681
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,600
something we can do really easily so um

682
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,120
i will make a note and take an action

683
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,600
sorry

684
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,200
say again though

685
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,720
i would suggest those be informal

686
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,440
meetings rather than formal interims

687
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,720
okay that's fine

688
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,480
in working meetings

689
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,640
okay so in which case we'll we'll take

690
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,799
an action to try and set up a webex for

691
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,080
for and and publish the the link on the

692
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,000
um the webex or teams or zoom or

693
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,640
whatever uh and publish the link on uh

694
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,400
the mailing list so that it's open and

695
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,559
it's and it's public it will we'll work

696
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,840
out an elegant way of doing it luke good

697
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,000
point but yes i think that the net group

698
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,640
role models that very well and uh we

699
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,720
should follow suit we have a couple

700
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,520
others in the queue um abdul salam if

701
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,120
you'd like to speak up

702
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,880
please take the floor

703
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,600
yeah good morning uh

704
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,960
uh my suggestion is uh to not split it

705
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,799
now the document this uh draft as

706
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,360
adopted it's good to when we review it

707
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,480
to be uh having the architecture and the

708
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,520
frame

709
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,520
uh framework together

710
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,080
as we adopted it so

711
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,400
actually it's also the second draft or

712
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,960
the zero one so and and

713
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,720
let's say if we get to

714
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,200
draft number five or six we can then

715
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,000
split yeah but now i think it's it's a

716
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,799
good

717
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,880
good stage that we see them together

718
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,760
while reviewing them and it's already

719
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,400
only 40 pages so i think it's it's okay

720
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,880
we can do it together and then in the

721
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,279
future maybe but

722
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,840
it's to the working group to split if

723
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,279
almost they agree to split and uh but i

724
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,960
think for me i

725
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,080
i don't agree now to to split the two

726
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,120
documents yeah thank you

727
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,559
thanks for signing that's a that's a

728
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,760
good point um maybe if it's good

729
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,520
particularly if if we're going to try

730
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,320
and

731
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,559
really get some cycles on this to just

732
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,880
keep all the content together for now

733
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,320
and then maybe

734
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,720
prior to iesg

735
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,520
remove one section i i i

736
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,919
it's a it's a valid point thank you

737
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,600
um

738
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,080
not too late right because at some point

739
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,399
we want to make sure that the documents

740
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,240
uh in isolation

741
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,679
are complete

742
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,480
so

743
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,000
if we want to keep them packaged

744
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,640
together right now we can we can make

745
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,720
two major sections you know

746
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,120
and say this is the architecture this is

747
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,640
the framework it's pretty much the way

748
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,240
it's organized anyway

749
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,279
but

750
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,279
uh if we want to progress the

751
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,440
architecture and focus on it

752
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,559
um

753
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,720
we don't want to get too much distracted

754
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,039
by the framework piece so when we'll ask

755
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,600
reviews and stuff and early reviews at

756
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,159
that time the split must have happened

757
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,320
because otherwise people will comment

758
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,559
and on the whole thing and delay you

759
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,799
know it's gonna it's gonna progress at

760
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,279
the speed of the weakest link so if we

761
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,919
separate them once we separate it will

762
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,559
be much faster for the p stand that is

763
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,720
you know priority and the other one will

764
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,159
be stuck which is as expected

765
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,159
okay

766
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,559
everything

767
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,240
when in fact we know we don't have the

768
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,159
content for the framework

769
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,559
for 2am we are missing

770
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,840
okay so so can i make a request you you

771
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,679
say that the the document is pretty much

772
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,720
in two sections if

773
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,120
if you if on the next revision you can

774
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,880
put an explicit section break between

775
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,679
uh the architecture and and the

776
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:58,880
framework

777
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,880
to pretty much say from now on is the

778
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,159
framework this will go elsewhere

779
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,360
and then

780
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,039
then the splits can be made fairly

781
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,799
quickly it's just to sort of do an

782
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,480
interim step on there

783
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,559
particularly if we start to have some

784
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,559
some uh sort of

785
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,039
uh focused meetings to talk about that

786
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,159
document

787
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,600
then yeah

788
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,039
exactly i mean as soon as we have

789
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,960
focused meetings we want to progress the

790
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,000
architecture from that right because

791
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,919
so as soon as we want to focus on that

792
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,039
piece i mean

793
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,440
the rest will be

794
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
dead weight

795
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,360
and actually i'm now

796
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,000
arguing against abj salam's point if

797
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,520
both documents are working group

798
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,279
documents and available through the data

799
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,760
tracker for review and comment then it's

800
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,480
one click to move between one document

801
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,679
and the other so

802
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,120
so perhaps

803
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,799
just keeping it in one document for

804
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,880
convenience is is not as convenient as

805
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,200
we think um

806
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,360
okay

807
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,720
thank you i have a i guess

808
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,720
two comments on the question so i i

809
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,039
fully agree with the comment made by lou

810
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,799
that

811
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:07,679
that

812
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,360
the the archers architecture should

813
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,360
should follow the layering model and and

814
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,840
and capable of supporting all the raw

815
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,200
technologies

816
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,159
we have in the in the in the raw

817
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,600
technologies draft

818
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,279
actually

819
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,440
and i understand it's it's work to be

820
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,600
done and i agree that um focus

821
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,520
discussions could be it could be helpful

822
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,760
moving it along and the other other one

823
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,399
is it's a question actually i am

824
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,760
a bit um uncertain on the aspects of the

825
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,399
framework and the architecture because

826
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,000
in my understanding of the charter and

827
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,559
as you just explained rick i i fully

828
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,799
agree that

829
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,480
the working group would be developing

830
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,080
solutions if and and when charters and

831
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,120
it's sort of the exploration of

832
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,279
technologies and what is available

833
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,320
requirements and so on at this stage and

834
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
i i don't know which one is more of a

835
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,679
solution

836
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,399
the framework or the architecture and i

837
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,720
don't know if we split which what would

838
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,080
be the order

839
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,760
but both of them

840
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,399
stepping into our solution and for now

841
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,720
it's maybe better not to split as you

842
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,519
just said or multiple people but i i

843
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,919
even even if we wanted to split uh i am

844
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,039
not sure on the order like

845
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,600
so so i guess the one that is less of a

846
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,600
solution would be first

847
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,360
but yeah

848
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,399
so from my perspective i think um

849
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,080
we can argue about the meaning of the

850
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,679
word framework and the meaning of the

851
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,760
word architecture i think that the

852
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,760
natural split for me

853
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,200
is between

854
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,440
um

855
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,880
a high level description of an approach

856
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,640
to solving it

857
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,440
and

858
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,399
the detailed solution proposal

859
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,320
so anything which really looks at

860
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,279
we will do this like this should

861
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,240
probably be a later document

862
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,519
uh and any text which says

863
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,399
the problem to be solved could be done

864
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,640
like this is probably the architecture

865
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,760
framework

866
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,200
um

867
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,799
it's it's it's difficult and there's a

868
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,279
lot of verbiage but splitting the

869
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,760
proposal from the solution i think is a

870
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,480
good way forward

871
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,120
and exactly what i was trying to say at

872
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,880
the very beginning here is what you want

873
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,080
to do uh is what i'm used to calling the

874
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,320
architecture is there is there are the

875
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,399
big objects without really saying it's

876
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,480
this draft or this rfc or anything like

877
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,360
that

878
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,760
whereas the framework really says here

879
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,159
is how it works oh we made it work and

880
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,519
we we pick

881
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,600
uh this component here which happens to

882
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,919
be rfc blah etc and we assemble them

883
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:48,960
together

884
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,039
and we set this flag in that message or

885
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,880
whatever and that gives you the whole

886
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,080
framework and how this thing works

887
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,559
that that's my understanding and

888
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,679
i mean

889
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,600
since you were talking i mean we had the

890
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,519
discussion recently at that net as well

891
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,840
right and we seemed to be an agreement

892
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,240
that framework was more i on the social

893
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,480
side

894
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,360
if that is people's understanding of the

895
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,919
word framework then i am i am fine with

896
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,200
that and i think this might also resolve

897
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,880
one of the questions that appeared on

898
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,279
the on the mailing list quite recently

899
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,480
about

900
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,080
whether the document should discuss

901
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,919
technologies that are

902
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,600
in progress in other sdos such as ieee

903
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,799
or 3gpp where we know they are working

904
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:37,600
on

905
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,919
time-sensitive networking for

906
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,559
802.11 for example but it hasn't been

907
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,320
standardized yet so should we

908
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,799
refer to it or should we not because

909
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,480
it's not a standard i think naturally

910
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,840
that splits so in the architecture you

911
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,080
one could say

912
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,360
technologies at the link layer are being

913
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,480
developed and examined which may enable

914
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,440
this

915
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,239
but in the framework document we need

916
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,918
text which says to do this we use

917
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,480
802.11xy

918
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,320
which has now been standard and

919
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,480
standardized so we then

920
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,159
solve the question of should we have it

921
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,239
should we not have it in this document

922
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,560
where architecture we can talk about the

923
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,000
future

924
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,119
and framework we talk about the fact as

925
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,040
of now as of publishation and i think

926
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,000
that might solve that problem um

927
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,280
janos did you have a comment you've

928
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,440
dropped out of the queue um i'm assuming

929
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,040
no so go ahead absalom

930
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,679
uh my understanding of framework and

931
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,079
architecture actually both of them they

932
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,359
solved

933
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,599
the problem so it's uh

934
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,359
mostly the architecture is more uh

935
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,359
we can say like uh

936
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,760
the hardware and the software usually

937
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,320
software uses the hardware so the

938
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,720
framework is above the architecture so

939
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
anything in the architecture

940
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,440
it will affect the framework but with

941
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,000
not the the the way around so the

942
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
framework comes after the architecture

943
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,359
as it's in the title saying architecture

944
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,520
and a slash framework so the framework

945
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,680
comes after architecture and its

946
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,680
solution both of them are important

947
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,280
solutions for uh raw technologies

948
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,119
uh yes i agree i think we are in

949
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,760
agreement all of it collectively i think

950
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,160
they're um obviously

951
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,480
english isn't everyone's uh national

952
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,040
language but i i think we can define our

953
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,800
own meanings for this conversation and i

954
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,920
think we are in agreement um so

955
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,200
carry on pascal because i know you're

956
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,280
watching the time

957
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,839
um i'm still good i'm still good um so

958
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,520
basically this is the slide which

959
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,520
summarizes what we want to see in the

960
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,280
architecture so far

961
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,680
and so basically we we described that

962
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,320
there are uh there is this what we call

963
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,880
udaloop and it's not the term from itf

964
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,640
it's really

965
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,040
quite an old term which describes a loop

966
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,480
which observes

967
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,640
uh orient based on some previous

968
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,280
knowledge and that would be the pc uh

969
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,640
you know knowing the network and knowing

970
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,560
the radios and making high-level

971
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,040
decisions about structures this side

972
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,599
which is basically the the per packet

973
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,440
decision for which we instantiated this

974
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,920
new carpet on the plc that will decide

975
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,079
what we do with this packet to forward

976
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,560
it in this wireless network and act

977
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,640
which is really now okay the forwarding

978
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,800
plane action and that's the use of the

979
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,560
barrier functions

980
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,119
so so we the architecture describes this

981
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,640
this loop

982
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,760
and um provides already some information

983
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,040
so we don't have the cross layer but

984
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,040
provides already information about what

985
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,920
the psc does and and how it's seen that

986
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,640
it will be operating uh it could be

987
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,720
operating on the source node and the

988
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,440
ingress in which case you need some form

989
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,960
of quote-unquote source routing

990
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,359
information in the back-end to to

991
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,000
to do that what was this decided by the

992
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
ingress along the path

993
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,079
or it could be um

994
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,839
more

995
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,440
distributed decision in which case the

996
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,079
pse or some functions of the pse have to

997
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,440
be distributed

998
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,200
inside the match so so we describe all

999
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,920
that and at this level it's architecture

1000
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,520
if we say uh

1001
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,079
here is exactly we are going to use

1002
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,680
segment routing and we will have those

1003
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,760
bits then we will have made the

1004
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,000
decisions about exactly what can be done

1005
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,680
at each shop and that will be the

1006
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,960
framework in my book

1007
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,839
and then

1008
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,280
we uh

1009
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,760
described the the use of the the that

1010
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,119
net service plane and how we enrich uh

1011
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,720
what is

1012
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,839
typically do free off in that net to get

1013
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,680
pareo to get more uh timing and if we do

1014
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,040
this this kind of source routing

1015
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,760
information then the hits and controls

1016
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,960
that we will need to to have a

1017
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,640
you know as an extension to the death

1018
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,560
net service there so we describe all

1019
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,680
they said that's the architecture piece

1020
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,399
next slide please

1021
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,119
so the the status has not changed since

1022
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,720
last atf we have not progressed on

1023
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,240
document

1024
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,760
the expectation is we would have time

1025
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,000
with lou to to progress and

1026
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
we already discussed that that

1027
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,839
it's not it does not happen but

1028
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,520
hopefully it will

1029
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,800
um

1030
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,960
we were wondering as well if there are

1031
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,359
any sections that could be missing and

1032
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,920
and so yes there is the use of dilip as

1033
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,280
we discussed

1034
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,320
um

1035
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,720
there might be uh high level discussions

1036
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,960
about encapsulations and that's where my

1037
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,480
other presentation of hope by heart

1038
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,200
destination option and source routing

1039
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,119
can can be appropriate

1040
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,400
and there was also the uh the work that

1041
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,480
jacob stein has

1042
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,560
introduced at that net and raw and

1043
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,800
everywhere uh about

1044
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,320
providing timing information in the

1045
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,160
bucket basically if this packet is

1046
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,079
scheduled then there could be some

1047
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,560
information as part of this

1048
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,040
segment routing source routing type of

1049
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,720
of information about

1050
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,320
where this packet

1051
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,560
should be in my network at which time

1052
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,000
so so when you follow the package you

1053
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,920
know if you're ahead of time delay blah

1054
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,599
blah blah so that can

1055
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,040
uh

1056
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,280
that can help pro deliver all the

1057
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,320
packets

1058
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,640
in the due window of time as opposed to

1059
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,320
to accelerate packets which are already

1060
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,320
in advance

1061
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,119
so so basically these are items that

1062
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,720
could be added to the

1063
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,480
to the document

1064
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,359
are there any other items sections that

1065
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,160
people in this course think are missing

1066
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,520
beyond the three

1067
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,440
and we can go back to meaningless but if

1068
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,400
something

1069
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,880
came out of mind of somebody

1070
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,000
then that could be discussed

1071
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,800
okay

1072
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,440
okay so well the two of the slides are

1073
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,720
very much

1074
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,200
that we we kind of uh improved quite a

1075
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,160
bit the the terminology and that was um

1076
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,160
thanks to the oem discussion in

1077
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,599
particular but also for for terms there

1078
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,040
is one thing that throws us as

1079
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,520
distinguished which is a bit less clear

1080
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,599
in the in the net architecture

1081
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,680
uh which is the distinction between the

1082
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,079
flow and the path um the flow is is

1083
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,400
basically in the water image the flow is

1084
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,280
the water and and the path is is the

1085
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,319
pipe

1086
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,040
and actually the cool thing about making

1087
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,520
the distinction is you can

1088
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,599
the pipe is the level at which we do

1089
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,160
networking and the pipe is the level at

1090
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,560
which you you decide uh what kind of

1091
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,760
processing

1092
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,000
uh every every molecule that goes

1093
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,200
through this pie

1094
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,280
has the same process

1095
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,319
so the process the process is per path

1096
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,880
not per flow meaning if you mix multiple

1097
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,839
flows

1098
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,560
in in a path then all the packets of all

1099
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,520
the flows will be subject to the same

1100
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,720
operations around the path

1101
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,359
and that that becomes useful when you

1102
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,079
when you want to either merge path i'm

1103
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,760
sorry merge flows

1104
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,640
uh into bigger flow big bigger pipes

1105
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,319
like i have those two pipes coming in

1106
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:19,920
that i want to merge them into a bigger

1107
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,960
pipe which is sized for both

1108
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,280
or when you you have this pipe where you

1109
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,960
want to put both

1110
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,599
a water flow but also something like oem

1111
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,160
to measure

1112
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,359
at that point if you if you do your

1113
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,920
forwarding logic based on the flow

1114
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,280
indication

1115
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,680
then you can't say i'm going to process

1116
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,760
this way in packets exactly the same way

1117
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,160
as the data packet because they don't

1118
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,280
appear to be coming on the same floor

1119
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,640
operating at the at the path level

1120
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,319
which is which is completely valid in

1121
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,079
the net architecture the testnet

1122
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,880
architecture says we are placing flows

1123
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,440
on path that's exactly what it's saying

1124
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,240
um if if we process if we understand and

1125
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,760
agree that we need to process things at

1126
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,119
the path level

1127
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,880
then we don't have this problem of

1128
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,640
merging things anymore it's just natural

1129
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,200
we operate at the path once the ingress

1130
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,440
has placed a certain flow on that path

1131
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,920
you know the flow will be processed as a

1132
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,599
member of that path and get to the

1133
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,839
egress of that path with with the same

1134
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,880
treatment as everybody else and all that

1135
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,359
so we it's it's a concept that we had in

1136
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:31,359
in in row since inception um

1137
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,839
at that net that has not been

1138
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,200
so well

1139
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,960
uh discussed at least in the case of

1140
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,200
ipv6 it's not really available and

1141
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,760
that's why i started this this hub by

1142
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,440
hop document that i will be discussing

1143
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,560
after

1144
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,920
but um

1145
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,119
for for this slide here uh yes we we

1146
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,000
have basically defined the flow and what

1147
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,079
we call the track by inheritance to

1148
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,560
previous work at the ietf the track

1149
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,680
being a special type of path

1150
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,800
that can fork and join you know

1151
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,440
i i've looked at the terminology of path

1152
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,480
at the atf and for for many groups a

1153
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,960
path has to be serial it's a then b then

1154
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,440
cmd it cannot be abcd or lthr and and

1155
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,319
maybe merge at a d and split again a

1156
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,000
path is not like that for for many

1157
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,359
working group

1158
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,800
including irtf

1159
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,119
path research so

1160
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,880
yeah i think using path is a bit

1161
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,000
misleading and so far in the

1162
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,599
architecture we use the dumb track which

1163
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,560
was really defined for for this

1164
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,040
next slide please

1165
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,319
and please review please review this

1166
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,800
this definition because you'll see

1167
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,720
the number of properties

1168
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,800
um now there's this concept of a

1169
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,880
subtract which is a subset of the track

1170
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,560
that will be used for a given packet and

1171
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,079
different packets

1172
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,640
which are placed on the same track

1173
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,440
uh

1174
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,560
might be due to pfc activity might be

1175
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,839
effectively placed on different

1176
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,240
subtracts

1177
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,760
now the

1178
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,920
a very quick question sorry

1179
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,680
isn't a sub track actually a path

1180
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,440
uh not necessarily because even a

1181
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,480
subtract is um it's it's still a track

1182
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,319
it's it can have multiple

1183
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,960
oh it can be split again okay

1184
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,720
it's it's a collection of paths and and

1185
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,119
really some of them super imposing on

1186
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,880
other ones i mean it's it's

1187
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,560
like if you look at just you think about

1188
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,280
a sausage or an egg right

1189
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,599
a knight you can have one path on top

1190
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,200
one path in the middle then you can have

1191
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,200
a nice path and so it's like four path

1192
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,359
with just an eight

1193
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,480
uh

1194
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,680
yeah it's it's

1195
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,280
some people also define the path as

1196
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,960
being uh you know

1197
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,800
the the experience of this packet

1198
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,640
whereas this packet being between a and

1199
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,359
b

1200
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,640
uh that's valid a was maintained as a

1201
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,680
single entity but with that net we we

1202
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,960
are doing things like network coding uh

1203
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,599
things like replication elimination and

1204
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,160
so it's even if you wanted to trace the

1205
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,520
path of a of a packet you realize that

1206
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,319
this concept is gone

1207
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,240
lou i see lou in the queue do you want

1208
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,560
to go ahead lou

1209
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,640
actually uh came in queued to answer

1210
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,760
your comment uh

1211
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,079
the i think what you're describing it

1212
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,760
matches well with the notion of

1213
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,240
protection paths um that's shown up in

1214
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,400
traffic engineering mpls

1215
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,760
uh net uh with pre-off um and it would

1216
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,839
be really interesting to see how it it

1217
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,440
differs from that

1218
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,839
uh have you looked at those that that

1219
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,119
prior work

1220
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,920
related protection restoration and

1221
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,240
trafficking one of the things the things

1222
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,040
i'm aware of are things like um plstp

1223
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,319
for instance

1224
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,160
where you you basically have two

1225
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,079
non-congruent paths it's the most usual

1226
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,000
thing i'm used to and those two are

1227
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,440
effectively path

1228
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,280
because there are it's either sequence

1229
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,079
of bcd or sequence fth and then you

1230
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,040
basically decide to use the the plan b

1231
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,839
when the plan a uh shows issues

1232
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,640
uh and and in that case the the sequence

1233
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,800
of things are really path

1234
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,800
uh i would argue that with that net we

1235
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,000
already

1236
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,400
went beyond that concept because as soon

1237
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,599
as you do

1238
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:22,560
uh

1239
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,880
replication and then further elimination

1240
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,599
of a packet how can you say which path

1241
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,359
that packet has taken

1242
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,760
uh it's it's more it turns into quantum

1243
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,079
mechanics right the packet has been

1244
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,490
through both paths

1245
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:38,079
[Music]

1246
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,240
so

1247
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,200
but yes i mean if uh

1248
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,720
yeah i'm not sure i'm following but i

1249
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,480
think that might be a good discussion in

1250
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,920
these breakout meetings that we're going

1251
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,440
to start doing

1252
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,560
i agree

1253
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,400
we can talk about it there or almost

1254
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,160
thank you the problem is there is a lot

1255
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,000
of history with this term path and you

1256
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,720
just point out and so so

1257
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,480
a lot of readers who are not used to

1258
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,400
what we are doing might misunderstand

1259
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,200
the text if we use the top path

1260
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,839
and so we effectively have a concept of

1261
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,839
serial path where a packet comes in gets

1262
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,800
out same packet without a transformation

1263
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,040
and then forward it hop by half by half

1264
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,960
and we call that a segment and the track

1265
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,119
is actually a graph of segments

1266
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:25,240
okay next slide please

1267
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,640
yeah so so

1268
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,680
i mean

1269
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,680
that's it for for this architecture

1270
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,599
discussion i think we

1271
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,520
we did a lot of progress so we agree

1272
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,440
that we will split

1273
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,240
we agree that we have missing items i

1274
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,680
listed some

1275
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,760
i hope that the mailing list will come

1276
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,839
up with others and then we will have

1277
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,000
those informal meetings where we'll

1278
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,280
refine

1279
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,160
uh

1280
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,160
everything that is already in there plus

1281
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,760
you know what's missing

1282
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,440
and in particular we have this objective

1283
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,760
of cross layer and the delete uh

1284
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,160
discussion with with blue so i think we

1285
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,079
we have ample work in front of us so

1286
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,319
that's really good

1287
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,559
now associated to that we need to say oh

1288
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,200
what's what what now can be a reasonable

1289
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,079
date

1290
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,559
for this one

1291
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,400
so

1292
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,440
um

1293
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,680
currently we have said november this

1294
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,839
year which is obviously wrong

1295
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:26,740
ietf113 is march next year

1296
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:29,119
[Music]

1297
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,119
i don't think that will be ready for

1298
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,119
iesg review

1299
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,520
uh march next year

1300
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,720
um

1301
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,559
i think one more discussion in the it

1302
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,880
would be

1303
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,760
i would be very pleased if we can get to

1304
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,440
the state where at the next ietf

1305
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,319
the everyone involved in reviewing the

1306
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:51,760
current document

1307
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,400
submitting changes contributing

1308
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,040
joining the informal meetings is is

1309
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,400
happy

1310
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,880
and we

1311
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,040
can then present where we are and

1312
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,559
perhaps

1313
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,000
go for iesg review maybe

1314
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,040
may

1315
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,319
april

1316
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,720
what do people think is that too

1317
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,720
ambitious

1318
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,520
i mean if you if you do this

1319
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,359
if we really we do this

1320
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,130
bi-weekly or something

1321
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,359
[Music]

1322
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,200
and

1323
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,240
yeah

1324
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,079
i don't say we will be ready by next atf

1325
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,760
we'll not but but

1326
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,720
um

1327
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,160
doing lasko

1328
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,920
you know having the some discussions at

1329
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,319
next ietf and and and deciding to do

1330
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,640
last call at that time or soon after

1331
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,920
next time

1332
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,040
that looks

1333
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,640
doable i guess yeah we're okay a lot of

1334
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,119
good stuff in that document and if we're

1335
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,800
splitting out the framework then we are

1336
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,359
reducing some of the content as well so

1337
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,599
yes i will focus on the architecture so

1338
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,280
we will be faster

1339
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,760
okay i'm going to say may because that

1340
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,839
means we should be ready for last call

1341
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:04,319
that gives us maybe a month of last call

1342
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:04,890
and then

1343
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:06,240
[Music]

1344
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,920
so last call in

1345
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,240
march ietf

1346
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,280
last call ends mid april

1347
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,440
iesg review

1348
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,079
we start yeah so okay i'm going to say

1349
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,000
may because april i think

1350
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,160
the first of may so i'll say may for

1351
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,520
architecture

1352
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,359
and then we need to create a new entry

1353
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,520
for framework right

1354
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,040
yes we need to create a milestone for

1355
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,720
framework and a document for framework

1356
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,119
but i would say that is

1357
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,800
um

1358
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,680
late and i will wait way later yes you

1359
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,160
can you can say 2023 just to create an

1360
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,280
entry

1361
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,200
well

1362
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,119
close to me

1363
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:50,040
let's let's say november 2022

1364
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,640
whoa

1365
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,960
yep let's be let's call it ambitious

1366
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,400
it's really because we have dependencies

1367
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,720
right i'm thinking about oem

1368
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,119
uh but it might be that the cross-layer

1369
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,400
story uh is a lot of work as well

1370
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,559
because we have to to review you know i

1371
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,559
don't i don't know how deep we can go

1372
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:13,680
um

1373
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,520
depending on which which technology we

1374
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,680
talk about

1375
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,359
yeah i also understand there's the

1376
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,240
dependencies on the oam

1377
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,000
the

1378
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,640
we so we have an item on the

1379
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,520
milestones which is the evaluation of

1380
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,559
existing the gap analysis document and

1381
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,319
i'm wondering whether we can address the

1382
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:37,760
gap analysis as actually the framework

1383
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,559
so

1384
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,400
no maybe not so the framework will

1385
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,319
define what we need

1386
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,720
and the gap analysis will define what

1387
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,040
exists

1388
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,720
and the combination of the two should

1389
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,119
give the gap

1390
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,839
um so those two need to be in lockstep

1391
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:58,160
so they they are mid-23 i think

1392
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,240
i'm just i'm terrible at estimating so

1393
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,440
i will

1394
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,400
i'm going to say mid 2023 for for those

1395
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,640
just for now i may

1396
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,800
i see it and at abdusalam you have a

1397
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,680
comment

1398
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,119
please go ahead

1399
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,960
yes uh i think uh deciding the time is

1400
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,800
better to be done on the list because

1401
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,440
it's not easy and also i will agree with

1402
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,760
the authors they are the most expert

1403
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,640
they can know the timing and everything

1404
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,640
said he i think

1405
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,200
we go for the what the authors say and

1406
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,920
then we can discuss on the list to to to

1407
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,880
make it uh easier to go forward thank

1408
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,079
you

1409
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,880
yeah okay so so i will say may for

1410
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,280
architecture because i think people

1411
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,040
think that sounds reasonable framework

1412
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,480
we can we can discuss it will be late

1413
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,599
later

1414
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:54,960
i think it is fine so uh

1415
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,040
i have a question pascal about the

1416
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,759
technologies draft

1417
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,640
you do have that next okay cool i was

1418
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,319
looking at my slides i can't find the

1419
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:09,760
slide for that because i have lost it

1420
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,760
if i fail to push them then i still have

1421
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,680
them on my desk so i can share if you

1422
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,160
don't can you share and and and push

1423
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,680
them afterwards and then then everyone

1424
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,000
can have a copy

1425
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,760
yeah i did not search them oh that's

1426
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,839
interesting

1427
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,839
okay i'm sorry

1428
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,559
it's okay

1429
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:29,520
so

1430
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,240
and just so you know uh this segment

1431
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,720
we're we're running pretty late we had a

1432
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,040
lot of uh extra time

1433
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,160
uh

1434
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,000
but uh i think we're about 20 minutes

1435
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,880
over for this section

1436
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,000
um

1437
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,680
and i know you disappear oh i've got

1438
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,119
them i've got them

1439
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:50,079
i found them it's powerpoint that's why

1440
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,520
i'll share

1441
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,839
sorry

1442
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,200
but normally they're automatically

1443
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,760
translated by the tool right when

1444
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,520
yeah this one this one did not it

1445
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,440
doesn't matter it doesn't matter i have

1446
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,599
it already there's something

1447
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:04,800
i don't know

1448
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,839
why why is this not

1449
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:11,280
why is this not appearing

1450
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,200
oh sorry i'm just now trying to make

1451
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,800
powerpoint behave

1452
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,599
uh there we go

1453
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,960
can you see i'd be quick on this one

1454
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,720
yeah could you can you see that

1455
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,760
could you make it bigger or because it's

1456
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,079
just a piece of green

1457
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,640
it's full screen on my machine yeah but

1458
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,040
the the slide itself

1459
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,720
is it's just a little bit of your screen

1460
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,480
is that better is that worse i'm trying

1461
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,280
to

1462
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,400
yes you should drag this you can also

1463
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,760
yeah that's

1464
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,640
better

1465
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,920
it's also normally a way to fold the top

1466
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,000
but that's okay

1467
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,440
okay um

1468
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,880
next to the question marked up right you

1469
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,720
must have a folding button which would

1470
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,079
basically allow you to hide the menu

1471
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:03,280
big difference

1472
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,319
okay so um

1473
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:07,920
this is drafted that's been there

1474
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,160
forever i did many groups which do the

1475
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,760
sort of thing we're doing like lp1

1476
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,480
recently they tend to to basically

1477
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,680
document the technologies they're

1478
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,640
working on so as to provide you know a

1479
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,880
layman of uh

1480
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,079
what can be achieved with those

1481
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,880
technologies and in the case of raw we

1482
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,319
we can have selected wi-fi six and above

1483
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,400
uh 5g and above

1484
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,599
uh 1548 ch on which 16 has been

1485
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,839
operating and did a lot of work and this

1486
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,680
new technology airbags that we already

1487
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,799
discussed uh and that um niels will be

1488
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,520
talking about a bit later that's that's

1489
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,119
already passed last call

1490
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,680
so we basically

1491
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,200
collectively i mean this is a huge

1492
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,559
number of offers from all those

1493
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,960
technologies collectively

1494
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,680
and put together this this draft

1495
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,599
where we uh

1496
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,040
we provide

1497
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,720
pretty much the same level of

1498
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,559
information for each technology so

1499
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,319
people can get their mind

1500
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,160
um and what what can be achieved in

1501
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,359
particular

1502
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,520
whether they come from and what kind of

1503
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,280
deterministic properties can be achieved

1504
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,359
with those technologies

1505
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:17,839
so we've done that the next slide please

1506
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,119
and um the the recent

1507
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,480
the duck is very very stable we we

1508
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,799
we had this this review by rocco thank

1509
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,559
you so much welcome for this

1510
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:29,599
yeah

1511
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,559
where actually uh rocco went very very

1512
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,720
deep into uh

1513
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,359
the text and the exact details of how

1514
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,359
things are set to make sure they are

1515
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,920
really correct and then there was this

1516
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,319
discussion between rocco and dave and

1517
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:46,079
and really a lot of that was beyond me

1518
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,119
it was really really the details of what

1519
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:51,200
was done and how it was done

1520
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,319
so

1521
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,799
after you know the conclusion of that

1522
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:55,680
work

1523
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,920
um i'm really happy with with the

1524
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,240
content of the document in general uh

1525
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,359
also thanks to chatty for our sixtiesh

1526
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,160
uh

1527
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,280
text and uh also i did some realignment

1528
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,720
with the 60s architecture which is

1529
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,880
published as rfc now

1530
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,760
and the bottom line is um the now is

1531
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,760
when we should have submitted to asg and

1532
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,960
i agree

1533
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,040
that it's what we should do i mean i

1534
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,280
think we're ready for our goblet score

1535
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,839
and if we make it two weeks we can still

1536
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:26,880
deliver in time

1537
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,319
perfect so so this was the

1538
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:33,040
um i was rereading the comments on this

1539
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,000
and

1540
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,559
the comment that was really raised was

1541
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:38,880
whether

1542
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,160
we should discuss it's the uh discussing

1543
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,920
standards in progress in other sdos

1544
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,359
uh or

1545
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:50,079
so referring to

1546
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,599
you are talking about in that in that

1547
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:52,960
picture but that's really why it took

1548
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,880
place yeah yeah yeah it took place in

1549
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,240
here so

1550
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,200
my

1551
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,760
personal opinion is that

1552
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,079
i i think it's perfectly valid to have

1553
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,680
text that says

1554
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,640
other sdos are working on this problem

1555
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,319
um

1556
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:09,359
uh

1557
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:13,119
tsn in 802.11 is a classic example but i

1558
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,680
don't think we should refer to

1559
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,680
standards that aren't yet

1560
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,200
in existence so uh calling out specific

1561
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,400
802.11 xe or whatever it is i don't know

1562
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,520
the numbers well um letters

1563
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,599
is a mistake but i think it's perfectly

1564
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:33,119
valid to say work is happening

1565
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,119
at the time of this document

1566
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,200
um it has not been standardized but but

1567
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,280
it is happening i think that is a

1568
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,280
compromise that works without

1569
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,960
um

1570
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,280
stating things which aren't true

1571
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,839
yeah we can still say how the work is

1572
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:50,880
happening at tg blah right yeah yeah

1573
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,119
yeah yeah yeah

1574
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,680
and i think that's pretty much what we

1575
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,119
do i mean

1576
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,240
i really have to to revisit but

1577
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,119
my memory is when we hint

1578
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,240
about b for instance in the case of 311

1579
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,040
uh

1580
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,040
that's what we do

1581
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:09,839
okay

1582
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:11,599
i see i see you in the queue and i know

1583
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,200
you were one of the the people raising

1584
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,280
this do you have an opinion

1585
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,400
go ahead yes i i want uh did the point

1586
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,480
at first what i wrote in my last email

1587
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,760
that i i

1588
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,359
would really like to see this on

1589
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,520
progressing and and really happy for all

1590
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,440
the the contributions

1591
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,319
and

1592
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:32,400
i i the i guess the reason i wrote the

1593
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,880
similarizing this question was that i

1594
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,839
guess we we sort of get into a bit gray

1595
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,520
area as well now

1596
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,359
yes it's understood that the work is

1597
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:44,640
ongoing like the dot 11 dgb which will

1598
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,280
specify actually wi-fi seven

1599
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,760
and uh divided into

1600
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,480
sub-work items and so on but when it

1601
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,640
gets to so it's absolutely good to refer

1602
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,799
to it it's approved project on where it

1603
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:01,200
works it's happening no question but

1604
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,920
when it comes to sort of

1605
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,839
individual contributions like i mean

1606
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,280
contributions

1607
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,680
that are at the level of um

1608
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,680
individual has not adopted yet by the

1609
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,960
working group

1610
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:13,920
and

1611
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,720
i guess i would say maybe in united

1612
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,359
mechanics they are not there in the

1613
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:23,760
draft yet like uh draft 2.0 of dgb is

1614
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,200
coming in march

1615
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,319
which will include sort of the first

1616
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:30,319
they call it release or package of

1617
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:32,319
features and tsn is actually in the

1618
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:34,720
second release so it's not even there

1619
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,799
there in the in the draft it's it's hard

1620
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:37,680
to

1621
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,520
guess what the working group will

1622
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,319
actually approve or accept so that's

1623
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:43,599
that's the

1624
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,520
question mark and there were a couple of

1625
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,520
comments or aspects let's put it this

1626
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,000
way where i didn't see the agreement

1627
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,880
coming between between dave and rocco

1628
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,520
very few but still very few left open

1629
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,559
and

1630
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,119
that's why i suggested maybe to to to

1631
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,440
make this decision point on on in

1632
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,680
general what goes into the document that

1633
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,680
could help concluding open items

1634
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,359
thank you

1635
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:11,280
thanks janice so

1636
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,319
i think

1637
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,760
really as i see it there is um the the

1638
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,680
there is a task for

1639
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,200
rocco and for dave and maybe something

1640
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,400
for yanosh there as well to say to

1641
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,720
review the um

1642
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,839
the the

1643
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:29,920
the references to technologies

1644
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,559
particularly in uh other seos that they

1645
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:34,799
understand i know yelosh is very deeply

1646
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:37,359
involved with ieee to say

1647
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:38,960
uh

1648
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,880
this one is correct this reference is

1649
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,119
correct this reference is

1650
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,599
uh work in progress and this reference

1651
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,640
is still personal so we could say

1652
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,440
something like there is interest in it

1653
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,880
because i think it's obvious that there

1654
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,720
is interest but

1655
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,559
without saying oh and it is happening

1656
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:59,200
because it has not been ratified by ieee

1657
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,559
um i don't know about the six dish

1658
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,000
example but it's probably worth just

1659
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,319
doing that double check um

1660
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:05,839
i would suggest that's

1661
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:08,880
probably part of the last call

1662
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,960
uh because it's a kind of a validation

1663
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,440
pass rather than a

1664
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,880
new content

1665
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,799
um

1666
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,400
i know i've just looked down the

1667
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,119
attendees rocco and dave cavalcanti and

1668
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,440
neither are involved so i don't know if

1669
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,520
anyone can reach out to them

1670
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,920
if we do a four-week last call i would

1671
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,160
hope that that is enough time for people

1672
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,160
to look at it

1673
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,839
does anyone have an opinion

1674
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,200
that would certainly suss out i mean

1675
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,880
this is eve i've been having trouble

1676
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,280
with my audio can you hear me

1677
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,319
yes

1678
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:48,480
okay um i think that the four week last

1679
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,359
call would suss out the half a dozen or

1680
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:55,039
so um unresolved uh

1681
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:57,839
back and forth that rocco and dave were

1682
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:01,200
having about the precise wording

1683
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,520
of the revisions you know and that's

1684
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,960
maybe half a dozen out of many dozen

1685
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,280
um that were provided

1686
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,880
which i thought was really a great

1687
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:11,760
effort

1688
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,799
um

1689
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:15,680
so i'm in agreement with being specific

1690
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,480
in the wording about the maturity of the

1691
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,319
various documents

1692
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,640
um and the different classifications

1693
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,200
whether they're adopted um lending

1694
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,359
towards adoption or personal

1695
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:28,480
um

1696
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,799
so i think some of this is a specificity

1697
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:32,960
issue it's not a lack of interest it's a

1698
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,680
just if we can get um everyone to agree

1699
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,319
on the accurate um

1700
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:41,039
portrayal of the maturity that then we

1701
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:43,920
can progress this

1702
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,240
eve if you and i take an action that

1703
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,520
when we

1704
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,520
send out the last call message to the

1705
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,720
mailing list we explicitly state that we

1706
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,480
require the

1707
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,559
references to be reviewed by people who

1708
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,640
are familiar with the sdos to which we

1709
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,119
rep to which we refer then

1710
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:02,640
and you and i can send a personal mail

1711
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,960
to rocco and dave saying you missed out

1712
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,640
but we'd really like you to look at this

1713
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,319
as well and then

1714
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:09,680
i think that will be obvious to everyone

1715
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:13,119
involved does that sound reasonable

1716
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:14,720
it sounds reasonable to me does it sound

1717
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,919
reasonable to the working group

1718
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,240
and i see that

1719
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:26,439
is with us as well

1720
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,480
oh rocco is in the queue go go ahead

1721
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,839
rocker speak

1722
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:37,119
yeah yes i'm here

1723
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,440
yeah i mean

1724
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,079
i agree before you discuss i think most

1725
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,400
of the comments related to ongoing

1726
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,680
projects

1727
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,079
there is a one or two related to

1728
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:50,400
proprietary solutions that have been

1729
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,160
used in wi-fi six which

1730
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:54,880
i

1731
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,799
feel they should not be there they are

1732
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:58,960
not in any standard not even any number

1733
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,559
one project

1734
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:02,000
and of course then and then there is

1735
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,079
another comment which is uh besides this

1736
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:06,880
two main aspects

1737
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,880
just as usual

1738
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,839
okay

1739
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,559
okay understood i i would suggest on the

1740
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:15,400
on the even if people are doing

1741
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,440
proprietary work

1742
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,160
that still shows that there is interest

1743
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,640
in the community to solve the problem

1744
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,280
even if it is not being done in an sdo

1745
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,400
somebody thinks it's important to do

1746
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,480
yes we need to qualify stuff right don't

1747
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,799
don't say there is this without saying

1748
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:34,960
hey it's proprietary or

1749
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,039
it's it's you know research or whatever

1750
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:38,640
i mean even if there are papers and

1751
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,280
research i mean all this is good to know

1752
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,520
uh

1753
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,440
but but it's it's we need to be very

1754
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,200
clear that's that's the point i mean

1755
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,240
yeah

1756
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,839
i agree yanosh go ahead and then we

1757
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:52,319
should probably move on because of time

1758
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:54,400
i i'm not sure on the proprietary

1759
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,119
because i think it's not not available

1760
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,039
for the generic

1761
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,440
public it's proprietary so like it's not

1762
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,280
a

1763
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,520
reliable available wireless if it is not

1764
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,280
available like if it has made it

1765
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,200
interesting that then then it's

1766
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,039
it's it's everybody

1767
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:14,319
can buy it or have sex or but you you

1768
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:15,920
know all the problems with proprietary

1769
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,359
vendor lock

1770
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:19,520
it's nice

1771
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,440
my point was that the technologies

1772
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,680
document is talking about

1773
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,400
these are the technologies that exist

1774
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,400
that are appearing

1775
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,119
that could be used in order to

1776
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:35,359
enable reliable available wireless

1777
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:38,319
as a general um

1778
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:41,359
review of of the state of the art so if

1779
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:43,280
there are proprietary solutions that

1780
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,799
shows that there is

1781
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:47,119
interest in solving some of the problems

1782
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:49,440
at the link there and if they were to

1783
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,480
become open standards um then they could

1784
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,280
be used by whatever raw technologies we

1785
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,599
develop at layer 3. it demonstrates

1786
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,799
there is interest even if it may not be

1787
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:03,200
that useful for an sdo like the ietf in

1788
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,200
order to build on

1789
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:09,520
but but you can't deny it exists

1790
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:12,240
perhaps let's take this offline but um

1791
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,039
yeah

1792
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:15,359
i think we have a way forward

1793
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:16,240
yeah

1794
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,400
i'm a bit between the two

1795
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,720
i i'm convinced by both of you and you

1796
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:21,920
know you're saying the opposite but

1797
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,079
you're both very convincing

1798
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:27,079
okay

1799
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,720
can we move to the third presentation

1800
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,599
maybe

1801
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:35,599
uh third presentation yes let me start

1802
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:38,640
let me stop sharing that let me find the

1803
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,760
next

1804
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,200
share my screen

1805
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,000
too many clicks too many clicks

1806
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,359
uh

1807
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:49,599
the title is

1808
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,920
uh

1809
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,359
the title is must match title and it's

1810
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:58,720
there

1811
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,359
can you see that

1812
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:04,319
right yes so it makes like please and

1813
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:06,880
actually um and in the interest of

1814
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,200
fitting in the other presentations i'm

1815
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:13,118
going to ask you to accelerate this talk

1816
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:16,640
should i click the magic time button eve

1817
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,679
go for it

1818
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:20,238
how long how long has he got

1819
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:22,479
i think yeah you've got right

1820
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:24,879
minutes

1821
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,319
so

1822
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,399
basically i already already discussed

1823
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:33,040
you know the concept of path and versus

1824
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,000
flow

1825
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,080
and the idea that we should be

1826
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,279
forwarding the path is is the

1827
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:41,679
network layer thing whereas the flow is

1828
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:44,000
the upper layer thing and so since we

1829
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,759
are network layer we should basically

1830
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:48,080
operate on the concept of path where

1831
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,319
multiple application flows can be mixed

1832
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:51,040
and

1833
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,799
extract it from

1834
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:53,600
um

1835
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,158
so as you know that net has two main sub

1836
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:57,920
layers that the forwarding sub layer

1837
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,399
which well already you you for the

1838
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,158
packet and it's kind of

1839
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:04,719
more dumb operation it has but has to be

1840
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:06,399
for instance scheduled

1841
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:09,040
uh whereas the services where you do

1842
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:09,839
those

1843
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:12,719
higher level operations like pre-op

1844
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:14,880
replication elimination so

1845
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,400
most of barrio but not all of

1846
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:22,880
them and uh

1847
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:25,920
i looked at how we could basically

1848
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,040
signal

1849
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:30,000
the that net information that's not

1850
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,960
signaled so far that net

1851
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,439
that that pretty much says use the flow

1852
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:37,040
and that's gonna be it

1853
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,198
and and then you another flow is another

1854
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:41,120
setup and another treatment so you have

1855
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,960
to to configure the network for every

1856
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,640
document

1857
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,399
and that's that's probably not very

1858
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:48,560
practical because probably the pipes

1859
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,560
have a longer lifetime than the

1860
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,080
individual application flows in there

1861
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,199
so

1862
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:58,000
ipv6 has three main types of extension

1863
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,920
leaders

1864
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,760
the hub by hub which has to be processed

1865
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,080
by every hub but can be ignored

1866
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,159
um the the destination option which is

1867
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:07,920
supposed to be uh processed by the

1868
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,159
destination of the packet and and this

1869
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:12,480
basically is source rotator

1870
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,679
um

1871
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:16,400
like like segment transmitter and

1872
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,159
interestingly if you place a destination

1873
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,880
option before a rotting either uh the

1874
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,719
destination is is the next type in the

1875
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,080
routing error meaning that you can have

1876
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,080
something in destination option

1877
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,480
and have it processed by every node

1878
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,239
which in the those

1879
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:32,320
segment routing or source right leader

1880
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,800
meaning that you could possibly use hub

1881
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,960
by hub for the forwarding because the

1882
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,199
forwarding is has to be

1883
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:41,760
observed at every app necessarily and

1884
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,920
you could use either by hub because it

1885
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,320
can be ignored or the combination of

1886
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,560
destination option and

1887
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,760
source writing

1888
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,480
to signal to service supplier so the

1889
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,880
draft basically discusses all this

1890
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,640
the big value is to completely separate

1891
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,440
the application you know the flows

1892
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,840
from the network operation which allows

1893
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,280
you to merge

1894
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,800
and in

1895
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,960
multiple flows and you know i am inside

1896
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,640
the same path and have the same

1897
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,760
treatment

1898
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,520
can we skim through the slide just see

1899
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,199
if there is one we'd like to discuss

1900
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:14,880
before i left

1901
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,679
oh this this just shows you know the

1902
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,920
uh the the packet and as you see the hub

1903
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,320
by hop just just one point on that one

1904
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,239
the hop by hop is the first thing after

1905
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,480
the ipv6 header and as you know one of

1906
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,280
the difficulties in that space is is to

1907
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,440
to not to have to go deep into the

1908
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:34,080
packet because sometimes the silicon the

1909
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,679
a6 will not

1910
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,840
process more than

1911
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,040
less than 100 bytes or

1912
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,440
this kind of number meaning that if if

1913
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,040
the transport is pushed a little back

1914
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,480
then there is no way for the hardware to

1915
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,960
even detect what the batman flow is

1916
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,800
having it's very early in the packet

1917
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,120
it's very easy fixed fixed place

1918
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,640
for the hardware and now we can do more

1919
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,199
stuff in hardware so that's why using

1920
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:59,840
hub by hub is kind of convincing next

1921
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,080
slide

1922
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,679
next please

1923
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:08,480
okay so forget it but if you want to

1924
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,679
read out the slides you'll find the

1925
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:11,600
requirement that we're looking at

1926
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,640
uh so basically this draft is

1927
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,000
uh well

1928
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,920
the only one i'm aware of where we

1929
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,600
effectively

1930
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:20,640
used

1931
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,320
the ipv6

1932
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:25,360
to to signal that net stuff beyond you

1933
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,040
know the application flow

1934
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,480
and so

1935
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,560
that's why i propose it to that net we

1936
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,239
need it for raw because we have this

1937
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:34,000
concept of path and we have this concept

1938
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,199
of flow and

1939
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:37,360
but i i believe that that that was

1940
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,840
useful beyond row so that's why i

1941
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:40,750
published it to that

1942
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:42,880
[Music]

1943
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,320
next line

1944
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,000
and i think we are done for q a

1945
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,960
yeah still a personal submission

1946
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,480
there are basically three information

1947
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,400
there so the redundancy you can think

1948
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,320
that as a sequence counter but you can

1949
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,400
place a lot more stuff than plain

1950
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,080
sequence counters and there are things

1951
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,760
which can be considered redundant and

1952
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,920
some others which will not be because it

1953
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,080
doesn't spread on that uh for instance

1954
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,880
if you do um network coding then you

1955
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,320
need to know which package you're in and

1956
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,320
then which code that is

1957
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,000
and so

1958
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,560
when you when you reorder you you

1959
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,480
you want to reorder for just the packet

1960
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,320
thing not for the fragments but when

1961
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,000
when you eliminate you don't want to

1962
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,920
emit different fragments

1963
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,679
uh path of shun is typically what you

1964
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,199
expect for that net something which has

1965
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:29,360
to be observed at the rehab and the lose

1966
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,840
path option is more you know if you

1967
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,679
don't do segment routing then you could

1968
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:34,880
do that

1969
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,600
it's more loose if you want to go

1970
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,159
in a large domain and you want to to

1971
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:41,760
maybe not do that net but something

1972
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,560
close on the other one

1973
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,640
and that's pretty much it for for this

1974
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,120
document

1975
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,760
so thank you for your questions

1976
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,960
reviews all this would help

1977
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,120
so pascal you're contributing this to

1978
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,400
net but

1979
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,239
i'm contributing this to that net

1980
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:04,239
because even if it comes from you know

1981
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,800
how we describe the raw architecture

1982
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,960
um and this separation of flow and pipe

1983
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,760
really um

1984
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,679
and then we do ipv6 that net doesn't

1985
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:15,120
kill us well they can do a lot more

1986
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,920
stuff but in the case of ipv6 it's it's

1987
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:18,800
just

1988
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:19,840
some

1989
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,960
subpar versus nprs so i wanted to to to

1990
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,199
get you know as much possibilities and

1991
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,440
possibly even a little bit more with

1992
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,840
ipv6 and with mpls the cool thing with

1993
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,840
ipv6 is you don't really have to have

1994
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,840
this explicit stack and you have to

1995
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,440
wonder if you have to go beyond the

1996
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,840
first information the stack to or top of

1997
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,840
stack to find this other information

1998
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,800
here you can really structure stuff and

1999
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,640
and since we can have tlvs we can really

2000
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,960
say oh the redundancy is expressed this

2001
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,000
way

2002
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,560
so so that's why i mean it was sad that

2003
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,719
it was so poor in the case of ipv6 and i

2004
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:55,280
really wanted to to make it a lot more

2005
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,040
richer and that's that's what i propose

2006
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,440
okay uh thank you very much pascal i'm

2007
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:05,040
watching the clock so i think uh that

2008
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,480
should be everything unless we have

2009
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,679
anyone in the queue which i don't

2010
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:10,880
um

2011
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,920

2048
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:41,040
it's

2049
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:44,159
my only me but

2050
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,320
anyway i'll try to

2051
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,799
to do it

2052
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:52,000
update of the raw use cases drop next

2053
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,679
slide please

2054
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:56,239
so just a reminder of what we have in

2055
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:59,679
the graph we we are covering these

2056
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:02,800
eight use cases in the draft

2057
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,480
the analytical communications i'm using

2058
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,679
parts wireless for industrial

2059
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:08,640
applications podium video what is gaming

2060
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:11,199
uav and v2v platoon and control edge

2061
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:13,920
robotic control and emergencies

2062
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,760
and for each of them

2063
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,280
we have the following structure please

2064
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,159
next go next

2065
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:22,159
basically first we describe the use case

2066
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:24,480
then we go into the specifics the

2067
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,880
challenges the need for wetlands and

2068
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,880
then at the very end the specific

2069
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,840
requirements for raw

2070
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,239
next slide please

2071
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:36,560
so with this in in mind

2072
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,199
we presented this where we last time in

2073
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:43,199
itf 111 and since then basically what we

2074
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:45,199
have done in the draft is to fix a lot

2075
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:47,840
of well a lot several editorial

2076
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,640
needs with some improvements and then we

2077
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,360
we had some discussions in the last atm

2078
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:56,000
meetings about this including some

2079
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,520
discussions and texts about

2080
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,480
non-linguistic critical communications

2081
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,560
so we have done that in the last version

2082
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,480
of the document we have added a sub

2083
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,480
section called non-literacy critical

2084
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:09,679
communications under section x.4

2085
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:11,360
requirements for raw for each of the use

2086
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,040
cases where we discuss

2087
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,280
about those dataset critical

2088
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:18,080
requirements or communications

2089
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,480
we also ask in the last itf meeting

2090
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,960
about getting some good reviews before

2091
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,640
going to working group last call we

2092
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,480
received one from corina

2093
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,320
thanks a lot

2094
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,560
most of the comments were editorial we

2095
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,000
are working in a new revision that will

2096
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,840
be available soon after after this

2097
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,600
meeting

2098
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,400
next slide please

2099
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,560
so then regarding next steps and going

2100
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,480
back to the point that the chairs made

2101
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,000
at the beginning

2102
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,600
about the time frame

2103
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,520
so i would like to ask once again to the

2104
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,080
working group for feedback if you think

2105
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,360
that there is something that needs to be

2106
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,560
updated improve add we move spain in a

2107
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,800
different way

2108
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,880
this is the moment because we are we the

2109
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,840
authors believe that we we are ready for

2110
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,520
for working going working through

2111
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,120
glasgow so

2112
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,880
we can either decide to get some

2113
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,199
additional deep reviews before or do

2114
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:10,640
that through

2115
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,800
the working group that's called us

2116
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,560
a question for the chairs to decide

2117
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:17,120
because from our side we are ready for

2118
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:20,000
for going working with lascaux

2119
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,360
okay

2120
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,440
thank you carlos um

2121
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,920
my only question apart from yes i need

2122
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,560
to do a good review myself and uh that

2123
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:31,040
applies to all the other working group

2124
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,360
um members as well please

2125
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,560
uh

2126
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,880
how does the use cases document align

2127
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,719
with the the industrial requirements

2128
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:41,040
because i know this was a um the

2129
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,960
industrial requirements sort of arrived

2130
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,760
after the use cases document was started

2131
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:49,360
do you believe that you have aligned

2132
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:53,199
enough with the or have you absorbed

2133
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:54,800
content from the industrial requirements

2134
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,480
that you need for the use cases or or

2135
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,800
do you still think that's working there

2136
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,880
so basically what we did the the

2137
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,480
industrial requirement goes in more

2138
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:08,080
detail so ours is more high level

2139
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,159
and we added a cross-reference to the

2140
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:12,000
industrial requirements for like further

2141
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,760
details this there is this additional

2142
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,120
document

2143
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,960
this was at that at that time when we

2144
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,560
did it i think it was

2145
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,639
280 millions

2146
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:23,120
before what we believe the authors from

2147
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,880
both drafts that make sense but of

2148
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,400
course it would be good if we can have

2149
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,800
some feedback from the working group

2150
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,639
from the use cases document we are we

2151
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:32,080
are open to do whatever the working

2152
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,120
group

2153
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:36,239
feels is the best of course

2154
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:39,040
okay so yeah thank you uh so it sounds

2155
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,199
to me that the the authors of the use

2156
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:44,560
cases document believe they have aligned

2157
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,960
and referred to the industrial uh

2158
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,520
requirements document great

2159
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:50,400
so

2160
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,440
yeah um working group uh some reviews

2161
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,400
and

2162
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,520
uh i think we will ask for last call on

2163
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:01,480
this eve do you have comment

2164
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,639
but you've said which is that we

2165
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:07,199
probably should review it ourselves

2166
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:08,880
yeah yeah

2167
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,040
i mean i think uh the resolution of the

2168
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,199
cross reference between the two related

2169
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:15,679
documents has been achieved and that was

2170
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:19,280
the topic of discussion last time

2171
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,199
yeah having having a normative reference

2172
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:23,040
between the two will

2173
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:23,920
uh

2174
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,960
force them to be published in lockstep

2175
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,719
but we can go through the working group

2176
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:31,199
last call we can do iesg review and so

2177
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:32,880
on without having to wait for the other

2178
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,040
document but

2179
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,280
that's that's a problem for another day

2180
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,080
so

2181
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,480
i'm conscious that we have public

2182
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:44,159
holidays in various countries and

2183
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:47,040
uh so on running up to the the winter

2184
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:47,920
break

2185
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:51,920
so i'm tempted to say after this uh ietf

2186
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,080
meeting we will probably put a four week

2187
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,480
last call to give people a little bit of

2188
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,199
time to to do some further reviews

2189
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:03,199
does is that acceptable to carlos

2190
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,280
yeah that's perfect perfectly fine

2191
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,960
thanks

2192
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,360
okay uh i shall make an eve does that

2193
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,880
make sense to you as well because i

2194
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,400
can't talk offline to you during the

2195
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,520
meeting

2196
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,800
yes

2197
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:15,760
okay

2198
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,080
i shall make a note of that um

2199
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:21,679
anyone else got any comment or

2200
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:22,719
should we move on to the next

2201

re-listen to it anyway and and take

2204
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:35,600

um

2206
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,520
yeah i'm scribbling notes as we go

2207
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,120
don't worry i'll be listening to the

2208

2222
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,220
yeah

2223
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:21,249
[Music]

2224
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:22,320
i

2225
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,400

that's the right one yeah

2227
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:28,159
all right tell me if you see something

2228
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:29,440
yes

2229
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,040
perfect all right

2230
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,199
so welcome everyone it's good to be back

2231
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:35,600
um because last time i didn't have the

2232
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,760
chance to present any updates now we

2233
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,920
have made many updates so let's delve in

2234
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,400
we're currently at version 09 of the

2235
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,520
draft

2236
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,199
um the topic of the entire thing is the

2237
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:47,120
album digital aeronautical communication

2238
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:50,159
system called in short ldacs

2239
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,719
um here's the note well

2240
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:55,120
and this is now the

2241
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,120
official

2242
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,560
title of the entire thing with the

2243
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,239
abstract here

2244
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:02,239
please note that apart from reliability

2245
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:04,159
and availability if ib connectivity over

2246
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:06,560
ldax we added security here in the in

2247
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,080
the abstract because it was one of the

2248
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,239
major updates that we did

2249
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:11,840
um

2250
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,239
here you can see the changes on the left

2251
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:16,159
hand side from the previous document and

2252
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:17,840
right hand side and now the current

2253
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:18,960
version

2254
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,440
um as you can see we streamlined a lot

2255
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,080
so uh the

2256
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,840
biggest thing that has happened is

2257
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,480
basically that we have seen some

2258
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,600
overlapping details and try to merge

2259
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,120
them to make reading through the

2260
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,960
document as smooth and easy for an

2261
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,560
audience as possible

2262
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,960
so that was probably the biggest

2263
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,199
thing that happened over the course of

2264
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:44,159
the last uh three months just uh really

2265
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:46,320
having external reviews uh going through

2266
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,400
the thing and then saying hey if you

2267
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,560
move that kind of information there or

2268
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,320
i'm missing that piece here

2269
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,440
um

2270
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:55,120
that was the most important thing we did

2271
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:58,400
also we received um feedback from the

2272
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,800
writing directorate i've incorporated

2273
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,520
that here and as you can see so the blue

2274
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,760
dots um the biggest thing that we

2275
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,280
changed is the chapter nine with

2276
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,480
security

2277
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,080
but also we worked on the introduction

2278
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,920
we worked on the altx protocol stack to

2279
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:14,400
make it a little bit more clear and then

2280
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,000
also worked a lot in the normative and

2281
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,719
informative references and just edit the

2282
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:22,320
latest publications on the entire thing

2283
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:23,360
so

2284
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,280
as i said so we address the entire

2285
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:27,520
feedback from the writing directorate

2286
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:31,760
and we uploaded um the version online we

2287
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:34,800
replied to thomas razi

2288
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,560
and i think

2289
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,400
with that at least the open issues

2290
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,880
should be addressed i'm happy to give

2291
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,600
some feedback on that um again

2292
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:47,040
references uh streamed at the work um

2293
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,960
and as i said the biggest thing was

2294
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,520
reworking the elder security section

2295
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,960
um also uh the the thing was that we

2296
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,440
wanted to add post quantum security to

2297
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,360
the overall lx security architecture

2298
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,520
because that hasn't been done yet

2299
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:02,639
um

2300
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:05,840
so that is the the overall picture

2301
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,800
now to the single chapters um so we got

2302
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,040
a lot of questions what aldex actually

2303
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:14,480
is and um well aldex is a wireless

2304
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:17,199
communication system for safety

2305
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:19,760
related communications related to safety

2306
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,920
and security of flight and regulator for

2307
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:22,960
flight

2308
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,800
meaning that

2309
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,120
you have several ground stations uh you

2310
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:30,800
have a radio in the aircraft and um only

2311
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,320
safety critical information is

2312
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:35,199
transmitted via ldac so that means prior

2313
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:37,679
to that it was the video mode 2 radio

2314
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:40,239
that was done uh that has done this kind

2315
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:43,760
of task um previous even later back um

2316
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,159
everything was communicated by a cars

2317
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,520
and now um

2318
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,040
ldx is

2319
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:53,360
from the view of um iko is basically an

2320
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,159
an access uh technology network access

2321
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:58,480
technology basically just enabling the

2322
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,560
data link as i said between aircraft and

2323
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,440
ground with data flowing for instance

2324
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,840
between airlines and the aircraft or

2325
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:09,040
the network operators and the aircraft

2326
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,000
and

2327
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
um because there have been so many

2328
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,320
changes in regulatory documents so for

2329
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,880
instance iko has worked on something so

2330
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,000
okay aka the international civil

2331
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,520
aviation organization has worked on the

2332
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:23,360
document 989 6 um in the version 03

2333
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:26,320
uh specifying the aeronautical

2334
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,000
telecommunications network that's the

2335
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,880
atn over internet protocols

2336
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,480
infrastructure

2337
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,719
and what they did basically was saying

2338
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:36,000
um hey

2339
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,320
until now um the entire data was

2340
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,280
transmitted by akas then at osi and now

2341
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:44,320
we really want to move it to ip and uh

2342
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:47,120
in that regards to ipv6

2343
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,600
and so other regulatory organizations

2344
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,480
such as rtca ring or uk

2345
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:55,360
um updated their respective

2346
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,840
documents and also published new ones um

2347
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:00,159
that i mentioned here because one of the

2348
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:02,080
biggest questions that we received is

2349
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,480
basically so yes now we know what aldex

2350
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,159
is but what kind of traffic will flow

2351
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:08,080
over it so ldx will be nexus network

2352
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:12,239
technology um for the 80 and ips plans

2353
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:15,280
uh off of iko and another question that

2354
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,760
we received is okay so um

2355
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,440
the current plan is that ldx will rule

2356
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,800
out starting 2024 uh probably to to due

2357
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:23,520
to

2358
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:26,080
due to covet it'll be a little bit late

2359
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,360
so

2360
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:28,480
um

2361
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:32,239
maybe 2026 maybe even 2028 but the thing

2362
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:34,639
is the initial rollout will start in

2363
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:36,719
europe and then probably asia has a

2364
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:39,600
large demands um the s

2365
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:43,040
is uh so so um the faa is even starting

2366
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,199
to integrate ldex into the the roadmap

2367
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:47,679
so um it will probably start in europe

2368
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:50,239
then uh go to asia then and then to us

2369
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:52,800
and maybe in 10 15 years it will be

2370
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,800
available worldwide

2371
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,920
um next up was uh the characteristics of

2372
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,880
aldex so first we we said okay uh from

2373
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,040
the previous systems uh such as video

2374
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:04,239
mode two

2375
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:05,920
uh which doesn't have for instance for

2376
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,280
instance a message prioritization um it

2377
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:12,000
doesn't have security so we just said

2378
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,679
what are the new things what are the

2379
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:15,600
characteristics so it's a very robust

2380
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,920
system because um in the l band so just

2381
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,360
on the frequency band there's pretty

2382
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,520
little space left so it has to be built

2383
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,520
as an inline system and then we

2384
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:26,080
clarified again how the entire uh sub

2385
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:27,840
network but also the protocol stack of

2386
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:31,280
lx works so here's uh basically the idea

2387
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:34,080
that um via an access router then as an

2388
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,960
a to ground uh air to ground router um

2389
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,639
the entire thing goes to the

2390
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,880
aeronautical telecommunications network

2391
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,199
and via the axis routers several ground

2392
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:45,199
stations that's let's say over europe

2393
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:46,960
are connected to that one

2394
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,679
and their user plane data is transmitted

2395
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:51,679
between a's and g's

2396
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:53,840
then for the protocol stack um that was

2397
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,679
basically just a clarification of how

2398
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:57,840
the entire thing looks without x and

2399
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:00,280
that ipv6 will probably be the

2400
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:04,080
traffic layer that ldx will serve

2401
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,480
now to the biggest change

2402
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,560
um security

2403
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,120
as i said um ltx is regarded as a

2404
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:13,520
network access technology in the atm ibs

2405
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:14,400
frame

2406
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,719
and uh several documents

2407
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:18,800
pretty strictly clarify what kind of

2408
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,920
requirements those technologies have to

2409
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:23,679
have such as

2410
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:26,560
access protection mechanisms such as

2411
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:29,120
certain latency that it has to support

2412
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:31,440
for instance there's a document the

2413
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:36,239
rtc80 350a that specifies for a certain

2414
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:39,120
kind of message type and those message

2415
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,280
types is what aldex is going to

2416
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,679
be for in the future that within 10

2417
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:46,000
seconds um this message has to be

2418
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,280
delivered

2419
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,840
okay the thing is 10 seconds doesn't

2420
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,239
look like a lot it does does look like a

2421
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,639
lot of time but the thing is um if you

2422
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:56,719
add authentication procedures key

2423
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:59,120
establishment procedures so basically

2424
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,360
the initial part of the security to it

2425
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,679
and then after that is done then the

2426
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:06,719
message has to go through um the 10

2427
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:08,560
seconds in for instance very worst-case

2428
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,880
situations where the link is is very

2429
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,719
weak so for instance you're at the edge

2430
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:14,719
of a cell

2431
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,880
and the bit error rate goes up um this

2432
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:18,560
this can be a problem so the entire

2433
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,880
thing had to be designed in with with

2434
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:22,960
that in mind that whatever you do the 10

2435
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,960
seconds is not to be touched

2436
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,120
and then we presented in the chapter um

2437
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,280
the distinction between user and control

2438
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,120
data protection of ldx because um

2439
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:34,159
there's pretty clear information

2440
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:36,239
on how user data is to be protected for

2441
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:38,159
instance on their safety critical user

2442
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:40,960
data ats data um that mostly needs

2443
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,560
integrity and authenticity protection

2444
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,480
but then there's also airline data

2445
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,560
business data and and obviously that

2446
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,719
needs to be encrypted so we had to make

2447
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:50,239
this distinction between those two

2448
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:52,080
within the user data space and now for

2449
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,560
the control data space so the entire

2450
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,880
thing basically what keeps ldx alive the

2451
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,880
most important thing was that it's

2452
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,600
available and nobody can actually modify

2453
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:04,000
um for instance uh

2454
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,320
uh for instance resource allocations

2455
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,239
because resource allocations isn't what

2456
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:10,159
makes aircraft or ground stations

2457
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:12,880
allowed to send user data

2458
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:15,120
so with those distinctions in mind we

2459
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,960
clarified that pretty much now in the

2460
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,000
security section we laid out an ldx a

2461
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,159
public key infrastructure

2462
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:24,840
with corresponding certificates

2463
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:28,960
um and uh then we went over the entire

2464
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,280
cell attachment procedure so the thing

2465
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:34,480
where an aircraft enters a grounds

2466
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,320
basically an lx cells who comes into the

2467
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,639
vicinity of a ground station does uh

2468
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:41,440
basic communications and and enablement

2469
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:42,960
and that's um during the cell entry

2470
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:45,280
procedure now both can communicate and

2471
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,679
then there's um the possibility to do

2472
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:49,040
the entire authentication key

2473
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,960
establishment thing in a second step

2474
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,719
called make so mutual authentication key

2475
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:55,440
establishment so we clarified that also

2476
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:58,239
why those two things are separated

2477
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:01,280
and then um we went on and clarified

2478
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:03,679
security levels for ldx because as a

2479
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:06,480
rollout a time will as i said be in like

2480
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,480
uh probably two three

2481
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:11,360
worst case five years um elliptic curve

2482
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,040
will probably be fine

2483
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,440
uh so we need to save a lot of security

2484
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,760
data obviously because um every bit that

2485
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,080
you send in in terms of security data is

2486
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:21,920
a bit that you lose in terms of actual

2487
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:23,600
payload so

2488
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,199
um

2489
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,199
here um the the

2490
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:29,280
design the most important design goal is

2491
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,920
that you have to save on the um security

2492
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,000
data bandwidth meaning that elliptic

2493
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,679
curve is quite elegant also curve

2494
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:37,199
compression stuff like that so it can

2495
01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:39,840
save a lot of data but then when you

2496
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:42,159
look at post quantum security for

2497
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:43,280
instance for

2498
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:45,840
key encapsulation or signatures then you

2499
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:48,719
will realize oh boy you run into

2500
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:50,800
10 times the traffic even 20 times the

2501
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,719
traffic because even the smallest and

2502
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:55,120
slimmest um lightweight crypto in post

2503
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,320
quantum can be

2504
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,800
quite a lot to to transport

2505
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,440
and so uh we identified um two schemes

2506
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:02,960
and mentioned them in the document so

2507
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,520
this is one way forward then again on

2508
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,520
the user data protection part um you

2509
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:09,040
have the distinction between

2510
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,880
air traffic services so safety critical

2511
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,719
stuff and airline operational control

2512
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:13,679
data

2513
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:14,719
um

2514
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:16,880
and the one thing has to be absolutely

2515
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,719
integrity authenticity protected and the

2516
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:20,960
other thing has to be encrypted so we

2517
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,800
suggested two different algorithms to do

2518
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,320
that

2519
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:27,840
lastly to the control channel part um as

2520
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,679
i get as i said this is where the magic

2521
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:32,880
of aldex happens because here on the

2522
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,960
left hand side you can see uh the

2523
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,840
superframe structure of ldax going for

2524
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,960
240 milliseconds at the beginning of a

2525
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:42,560
superframe you have the broadcast

2526
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,960
channel at the top and this is where a

2527
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,880
ground station basically says hey i'm

2528
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:47,760
here

2529
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,679
uh please talk to me and the random

2530
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:52,800
access channel that's the one below uh

2531
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,560
r a c h

2532
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,639
um this is where an aircraft can request

2533
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:59,040
access to a cell and the problem is um

2534
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,119
due to other reasons it's hard to put in

2535
01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:02,719
security here so we said no we don't

2536
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:05,920
want to put security here but what when

2537
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:08,080
where security is needed absolutely

2538
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:11,600
needed um is in the dedicated and common

2539
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,119
control channel on the right hand side

2540
01:35:13,119 --> 01:35:15,840
so ccch is the common control and dcch

2541
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,239
because the common control is where

2542
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:20,159
aircraft are told

2543
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:21,840
when to send when they are allowed to

2544
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:24,159
send user data and then the dedicated

2545
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:26,400
control aircraft demand

2546
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,560
a certain amount of user data to be sent

2547
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,800
and so you have to be sure that whoever

2548
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:33,199
is requesting resources here is actually

2549
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:35,520
allowed to do that and this is why uh

2550
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,840
protection mechanisms must be in place

2551
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:38,639
here

2552
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:40,800
and so this is what we did with with the

2553
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,760
security chapter um we clarified all

2554
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:45,600
those open points

2555
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:48,639
and also added that the entire thing is

2556
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:49,679
a

2557
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:51,840
work in progress so the entire standard

2558
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,760
is obviously not done

2559
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,440
but this is um

2560
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:56,960
what we are laying out now for review

2561
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:59,040
because we got some requests on on how

2562
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,960
security handled in detail and this is

2563
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,719
what we wanted to offer here in the

2564
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:03,920
document

2565
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,800
a high level view that helps understand

2566
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:11,520
the reader the design choices we made

2567
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,440
and i think that's that's it from my

2568
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,920
side those were the updates i think we

2569
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,600
addressed the feedback that we received

2570
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:18,639
thus far

2571
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:21,440
and now my question would be to jones

2572
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:23,040
gutter

2573
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,280
how the entire thing would proceed from

2574
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,679
here also with from the chairs because

2575
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:29,280
we have we answered

2576
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:31,760
the the feedback that we get that we got

2577
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:34,159
and now i'm like uh okay

2578
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:36,639
what's next so thank you

2579
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:38,719
thank you niels um i can answer what's

2580
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:40,320
next um

2581
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:43,119
we are still waiting for

2582
01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:44,000
uh

2583
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,880
other review feedback from the other

2584
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,920
areas so iesg review

2585
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,760
um goes to all the areas uh rooting

2586
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,520
obviously are moving faster than

2587
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,920
everyone else at the moment so uh you

2588
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,360
got your review back from them very

2589
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:02,560
quickly i imagine security as with all

2590
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:04,320
these things there are the the various

2591
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,960
area reviewers have a queue i imagine

2592
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:09,520
security are going to take their time on

2593
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:12,400
this because this is complex

2594
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,320
and actually in my experience the

2595
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,239
security area always give really good

2596
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:19,040
reviews but they take their time

2597
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:22,000
um so there will be more reviews coming

2598
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,719
back from other areas and i'm afraid to

2599
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:27,199
say this does just take a bit of time so

2600
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:29,199
a little bit of patience

2601
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:30,960
does that answer

2602
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:33,440
cool so

2603
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,119
so just since uh

2604
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:38,960
since i was asked to comment also um

2605
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,800
to the extent that i can kick those

2606
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:44,560
reviews along faster i will i will do so

2607
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,800
thanks john i think for things like ops

2608
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,639
and interior and things like that there

2609
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:50,560
it will be a a quick

2610
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,119
text editorial read to see whether they

2611
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:55,119
can understand it i can't

2612
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,360
see that they're going to have much

2613
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,760
operational comments if but i may be

2614
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,840
wrong i don't i don't know how transport

2615
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,679
are going to care too much they may say

2616
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:04,639
why aren't you doing this in the

2617
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:06,480
transport area but that's a discussion

2618
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:07,280
for

2619
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:09,360
for the ad and the chairs to have with

2620
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:11,840
them but it's fine as well right i mean

2621
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,040
the

2622
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,400
the one that i think we have to look out

2623
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,480
for is a security one and that's the one

2624
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,080
i'll talk with those ideas about you

2625
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:19,920
know expediting it

2626
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:22,239
yeah because i i see this as complex and

2627
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:24,480
i it's they're gonna need a bit of

2628
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,080
warning about this because it's it's a

2629
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:27,520
complex piece

2630
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:28,320
yeah

2631
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:29,119
um

2632
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:30,480
can i make a request to the working

2633
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,480
group of course uh in light of the

2634
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,800
reviews the text is changing as i as i

2635
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:37,360
said before can you have a chance uh

2636
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:39,280
working group members just to have a

2637
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,960
re-read and

2638
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,480
uh check that you're happy with the

2639
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:43,760
changes that have been happening because

2640
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,400
this is a working group document so uh

2641
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,480
we all need to be aware of that i mean

2642
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,639
it's it's kind of left always on its way

2643
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:52,080
out of the working group but we need to

2644
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,520
confirm that we are still happy with the

2645
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,679
changes that are happening i i i have

2646
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:57,600
confidence that we will be but it's

2647
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,360
worth double checking

2648
01:38:59,360 --> 01:38:59,690
um

2649
01:38:59,690 --> 01:39:01,199
[Music]

2650
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:04,559
eve do you have anything to add

2651
01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:06,719
looks great thank you for all the hard

2652
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:07,760
work

2653

yeah good work guys it's this is a this

2654
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:13,040
is a mighty document so uh yeah thank

you

2656
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,440

thank you niels uh i think we have now

2659
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,600
got to the last 20 minutes of the

2660
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:22,639
session

2661
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:25,280
so uh really open mic

2662
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:28,719
questions comment

2663
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,360
anyone want to add anything now is your

2664
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:34,360
chance

2665
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:48,000
resounding silence

2666
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:51,520
it's either midnight at your your local

2667
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:52,880
time and you've fallen asleep at your

2668
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:55,679
desk or uh

2669
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:56,790
i guess in my case

2670
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:59,280
[Laughter]

2671
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:01,199
so um

2672
01:40:01,199 --> 01:40:03,199
just looking down my list of notes

2673
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:04,639
the chairs will

2674
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:08,400
set up some informal uh interim

2675
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,320
maybe bi-weekly meetings depending on

2676
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:13,600
public holidays for a chance to really

2677
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:16,719
get on top of the raw architecture

2678
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:19,040
we will be

2679
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:21,280
updating some of the milestones based on

2680
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,679
some of the feedback we've had so far we

2681
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:26,239
will guess some of the far off ones

2682
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:27,520
we will set

2683
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,280
more realistic milestones for some of

2684
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,639
the near ones

2685
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:32,960
hopefully that will please john and he

2686
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,679
can then click approve to some of our

2687
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:37,119
updates

2688
01:40:37,119 --> 01:40:38,880
uh working group last call for the

2689
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:40,639
technologies draft it will be a four

2690
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:42,159
week uh

2691
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:45,440
last call with a request for please

2692
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,800
everybody review the references

2693
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,560
particularly those of you with influence

2694
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:52,480
or understanding of the referenced sdos

2695
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,719
the use cases again uh we'll put a full

2696
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:57,040
week on there because we'll have two

2697
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:58,480
working group last calls happening at

2698
01:40:58,480 --> 01:40:59,760
the same time

2699
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,639
and public holidays and

2700
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:05,360
to give everyone a chance to review that

2701
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:06,560
as well

2702
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,880
uh but otherwise

2703
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,080
that looks pretty good we'll have some

2704
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,760
documents from working group last call

2705
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:14,880
we've got ldax in iesg review

2706
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,840
um

2707
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:18,080
we should get some rfcs coming out of

2708
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,440
this group

2709
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,440
sometime next year because the editors

2710
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:22,719
always take a little bit of time to do

2711
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:25,679
it properly which is nice but um

2712
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:27,360
i think we can be pleased as a working

2713
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,360
group that we're producing things or

2714
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:32,480
documents of value which is important so

2715
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:33,440
uh

2716
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,600
well done but it does rely on everyone's

2717
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:37,840
good reviews as well

2718
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,840
um eve do you have anything to add i

2719
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:42,000
feel like i've been talking for hours no

2720
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,080
i've been grateful so that i haven't had

2721
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:46,480
to be entirely

2722
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:48,159
highly awake

2723
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:49,520
entirely

2724
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,280
so i'm quite grateful but actually i

2725
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:53,840
will express my gratitude as well that

2726
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,440
things have progressed and that the

2727
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:56,960
discussions have been

2728
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:59,119
both respectful but very candid and

2729
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:01,199
honest and that we're working through

2730
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:03,920
some of the tussles uh in the

2731
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:06,639
discussions around uh drafts and and

2732
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:08,880
references and things like that so

2733
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,880

2738
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:23,679
take the ar to re-listen to the video

2739
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:26,000
and take notes at that time

2740
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,480

01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:32,000
action to try and produce some meeting

2743
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,320

2744
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:37,280
delay so uh john when you send us the

2745

2750
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:50,560
transcript of this entire meeting on

2751
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:52,480
youtube at some point the ietf publishes

2752
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:57,159
everything on youtube so uh

2753
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:01,440
um i've been you know watching things

2754
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:04,960
that i've missed um uh over the last few

2755
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,440
days so it's been quite helpful

2756
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:08,719
brilliant

2757
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:12,080
okay um in which case i'm tempted to

2758
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:14,719
close eve any objections yes i think we

2759
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:16,880
should give you back some of your

2760
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:18,639
morning or evening whatever time zone

2761
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:19,840
you're in

2762
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:20,639

oh john makes a comment in the chat to

2766

say that you can use youtube auto

2767

transcription

2768
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,639
oh hey that might save us some time it

2769
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:34,800
might take some post editing

2770
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,960
i think it's fine to re-listen sort of

2771
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,920
solidifies things it's okay

2772

meeting uh

2784
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:08,400
ietf113 which is in bangkok allegedly in

2785
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,440
person uh kovid willing

2786
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:14,159
transports permissions willing

2787
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:16,080
may see some of you in person maybe

2788
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:18,239
attending virtually not sure what my

2789
01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:20,639
situation is but we plan to hold a

2790
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:22,639
meeting there

2791
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:25,440
uh pascal is back

2792
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:29,600
i've heard that it won't be in bangkok i

2793
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:32,320
mean the latest noise i heard

2794
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,560
uh valid or not i can't say but looks

2795
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,719
that it is it could effectively take

2796
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:39,840
place in person but most probably the us

2797
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:40,880
and

2798
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:43,840
not not in bangkok bangkok i think it's

2799
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:46,080
don't think about it okay yeah yeah it

2800
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,920
was i looked at the main ietf website

2801
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:51,679
and it said 113 in bangkok and i was i

2802
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:54,239
i can no longer remember what um you

2803
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:56,239
know things i know are public and what

2804
01:44:56,239 --> 01:44:59,840
things i know are private but i'm i'm 99

2805
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,760
sure that during the plenary lars said

2806
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:03,679
that it will not be in bangkok so i

2807
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:05,760
don't think i'm giving too much away

2808
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:07,840
okay it would be nice to meet you

2809
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:10,080
dominique says dominique says in the

2810
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:12,159
chat i heard eu rather than not us i

2811
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:14,080
think that lars also said that the mic

2812
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:16,880
so i'll just confirm that as well

2813
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:17,679
okay

2814
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:19,280
okay i missed the announcement obviously

2815
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:21,360
but it would be nice to meet uh again in

2816
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:22,880
person um

2817
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:25,520
you know kovid restrictions permitting

2818
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:28,480
so uh we will the key point is we will

2819
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:32,239
be holding a uh raw session for ietf one

2820
01:45:32,239 --> 01:45:34,560
one three where we will probably i will

2821
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:35,600
say

2822
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:38,239
oh sorry go ahead we'll we will where

2823
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:40,000
the authors of of these various

2824
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,840
documents will hopefully be requesting

2825
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,280
working group last call for things like

2826
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:45,600

2827
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:48,320
celebrating the rfc editor status of

2828
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:51,679
various things so that'll be good

2829
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:53,440
great

2830
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:54,560
go ahead

2831
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,800
oh i completely forgot what i was gonna

2832
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:59,800
say

2833

we have never met in person we had the

2834
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:11,199
unlucky situation that our first ietf uh

2835
