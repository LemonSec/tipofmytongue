1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,799
okay it's 9 30.

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,400
this is the v6 ops working group

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:16,760
welcome

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,720
[Music]

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,039
let us begin with our note well

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,199
um

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,480
if you have not seen this before please

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,039
read it carefully

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,400
anything you say

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,279
um

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,360
is a contribution to the ietf and will

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,120
be treated as such so

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,719
read through this slide

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,559
also

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,800
um

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,600
take a look at some of the rules that

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,920
govern how we work at the bottom of this

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,719
page bcp 9 25 54 78

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,559
79

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,719
we've also been reminded by the iesg

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,559
to treat each other with respect and

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,840
courtesy

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,600
this working group has been pretty good

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,320
but

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,680
um

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,559
a reminder never hurts

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,759
this is our agenda for the day we have

28
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,439
three drafts

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,799
um

30
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,280
the first pros and cons of ipv6

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,680
transition and technologies

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,840
so i will stop sharing and

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,910
invite the presenter to

34
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,400
[Music]

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,640
um

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,840
gabor you are the presenter

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,960
oh you will be the presenter

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,919
yes here we go

39
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,640
and your deck is being shared

40
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,840
through the scones this i think it is

41
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,840
yeah sure

42
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,439
can you see me

43
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,040
yes go on ahead

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,960
thank you it will be a very very short

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,719
presentation so it i have only the main

46
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,560
title slide and just one more slide

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
so it's because uh

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,120
uh we feel that now our draft is ready

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,760
for working loop last call we did two

50
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,239
changes so there were two places in the

51
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,360
draft

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,680
which were not ready and

53
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,920
removed both so it was

54
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,599
section 4.2

55
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,920
about the issue of the security of the

56
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,800
stateful technologies and i opened a new

57
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,040
individual draft for that it's titled

58
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,120
scalability of ib version 6 generation

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,640
technologies for

60
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,720
ipv version was a service

61
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,879
and here's a link for the

62
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,879
zero zero version

63
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,160
it has real content sulfite

64
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,040
contains the scalability results of ip

65
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,640
tables which is of course a nat4 for a

66
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,360
stateful id4 for implementation but it

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,319
serves the sample for the

68
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,640
n86 for skyway test

69
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,319
and i would like to present it right

70
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,680
after this draft

71
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,920
and there's another draft but it's just

72
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,319
a space holder uh it's about the

73
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,760
benchmarking of

74
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
all five ip version foil service

75
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,159
technologies which was referred in

76
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,640
section five so now

77
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,599
i think there's no no unfinished parts

78
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,000
so i feel that our draft is ready for

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
blocking of last call and i will have to

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,920
ask you to do that so that we can

81
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,239
publish the document as soon as possible

82
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,840
to assist the operators with a stable

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,840
document

84
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,879
that's the one

85
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,959
see anyone on the q so i'm assuming

86
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,640
there are no objections to a working

87
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,839
group last call

88
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,200
okay i will start the working group last

89
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
call next week

90
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,599
and i believe you are the next presenter

91
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,959
too no

92
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,239
yes

93
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,680
so i try to

94
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,360
close the deck

95
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,120
and try to

96
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,480
uh

97
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,319
open

98
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,799
how can i open the slides maybe i will

99
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,799
ask your permission and then you give me

100
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,560
the permission to

101
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,000
yeah here it is i see the green check

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,519
yes and scalability yes

103
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,880
that's it

104
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,040
and share

105
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,199
good can you see the slides

106
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,479
yes

107
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,440
thank you so it's a new draft

108
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,120
and as i said it uh contains only uh

109
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,360
minimum results uh

110
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,759
so in fact this draft is about the

111
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,080
scalability of uh ipv version six 6

112
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,479
transition technologies but so far it

113
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,080
contains only the results for stateful

114
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,600
n844 ip tables and its main goal now is

115
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,280
to serve as a sample for the

116
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,520
measurements and for what kind of

117
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,680
results can be presented and i would

118
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,199
like to ask the opinion of the working

119
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,360
group if these kind of results are

120
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,800
useful or not

121
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,039
and if not then but other kind of

122
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,039
measurements are necessary and of course

123
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,360
we had a secondary goal because at the

124
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,680
last itf meeting someone i'm sorry i

125
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,800
don't remember who asked uh if we could

126
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,520
measure uh some um

127
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,560
results about iptv so i did so but the

128
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,000
main goal is is to serve samples and

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,880
let's uh may say some words about what

130
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,080
have measured so

131
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,199
measurements

132
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,759
of two kinds scalability agents the

133
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,560
number of cpu cores how the performance

134
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,960
of ip tables scales up with the number

135
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,199
of cpu cores and the other measurement

136
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,199
is scalability agents the number of

137
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,120
concurrent sessions of course number of

138
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,320
compensations uh when they increased we

139
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,720
expect that uh somebody performance will

140
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,000
be decreased

141
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,880
and the

142
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,560
entire uh

143
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,400
description of the methodology is in

144
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,560
this draft below i have presented this

145
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,840
on monday in the bmw

146
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,039
working group

147
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,000
and the draft is there so i don't want

148
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,440
to

149
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,400
use

150
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,440
your time for that

151
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,720
adjust

152
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,440
some parameters and then the results

153
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,720
so i used 1 2 four eight and 16 cpu

154
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,240
cores and measure two quantities it was

155
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,800
a maximum connection establishment rate

156
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,560
and throughput using video

157
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
bi-directional traffic as recommended by

158
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,639
rfc 8219

159
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,600
and

160
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,240
i used the power edge servers with a 2.1

161
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,319
gigahertz

162
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,720
intex 7 cpus the clock frequency was set

163
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,319
fixed to 2.5 gigahertz and it has quite

164
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,039
a

165
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,360
amount significant ram it was uh 384

166
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,080
gigabytes and used 10 giga to import

167
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,479
network cards and somewhat old linux

168
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,000
version and uh linux kernel

169
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
so here are the results

170
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,919
the first line shows the number of cpu

171
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,160
cores those always double

172
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,160
so set you're using a

173
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,360
c line scanner parameter so only

174
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,080
this number of cpus were on and others

175
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,440
were off

176
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,560
and the first lines shows the

177
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,960
connection per second median minimum

178
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,599
maximum values all the units are

179
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,800
thousands

180
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,080
so it means that with a single cpu core

181
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,880
uh

182
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,880
273.5

183
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,479
000 uh connections were established per

184
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,440
second

185
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,759
and as you see when we double the number

186
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,240
of cpu cores uh the performance doesn't

187
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,599
really double but scale scales up i feel

188
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,879
quite well so uh if you see at the end

189
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,639
with 16 cores

190
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,199
it's about 10 times as much as with one

191
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,960
core so

192
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,440
i think it's not not a bad scale up

193
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,479
and

194
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,000
uh

195
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,720
row number five shows the

196
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,960
relative scale up of course it is one

197
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,280
with one cpu and

198
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,440
we do it's uh 0.83

199
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,680
but of course it's it should be one if

200
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,199
if

201
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,199
the number of connections would have

202
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,919
been doubled but it's less than that

203
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,240
and at the end of course it's about

204
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,879
0.666 so it's it means that

205
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,200
with 16 cores we

206
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,640
can provide the

207
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,000
performance

208
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,039
10 times as high as with one core and we

209
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,679
know that you can see the throughput

210
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,919
of course here is also median minimum

211
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,279
maximum

212
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,360
and it also scales up very similarly

213
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,240
a very bit better maybe the performance

214
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,440
of 11 cores but it's very similar so it

215
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,800
was

216
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,200
the scalability that is the number of

217
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,560
cpu cores

218
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,600
and

219
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,720
the other uh one is the scalability

220
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,360
agents the number of concurrent sessions

221
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,000
and the number of concurrent sessions

222
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,200
was set

223
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,120
by using different

224
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,399
number of

225
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,040
source for destination port

226
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,120
number combinations

227
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,680
and i usually increase

228
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,320
the number four-fold except the last

229
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,480
case you will see y

230
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,920
and

231
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,160
also i increase the

232
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,320
hash table size

233
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,480
proportionally with the

234
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,440
number of concrete sessions

235
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,640
except the last two cases and some

236
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,640
non-uniform memory access issues also

237
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,519
influenced if you as the last case you

238
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,959
will see why

239
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,120
and imagine the same two quantities

240
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,360
maximum connection excavation rate and

241
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,600
throughput using bi-directional traffic

242
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,040
as recommended by rfc 82 19 and here are

243
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,240
the results

244
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,120
in the first last row you can see the

245
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,160
number of

246
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,360
concrete sessions the number of uh

247
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,959
source port number destination port

248
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,720
number combinations

249
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,519
and

250
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,680
as you see they were nearly always

251
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,920
doubled except in the last case

252
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,279
it was not doubled in the last case

253
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,279
because it didn't fit in the memory so

254
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,959
when we used

255
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,880
400 million connections then the memory

256
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,360
consumption was was below 150 gigabytes

257
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,959
and

258
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,079
it was

259
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,560
able to fit into the numerical memory

260
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,200
but it was when it was doubled and then

261
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,800
it didn't fit into the numeral local

262
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,880
memory but still fit in the entire

263
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,079
memory

264
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,959
and as you see the hash table size

265
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,560
we are usually always increased it four

266
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,440
times except the last fuckbonk case so

267
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,240
you see at 100 million

268
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,680
uh 100 million the hashtable size 2 to

269
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,480
the power of 27 and it's 400 million

270
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,120
it's just 2 to the power of 28 because

271
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,120
the system didn't allow me to set to a

272
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,200
higher value and of course it was not

273
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,000
increased at the last column neither

274
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,160
so you can see the

275
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,399
both the connection per second median

276
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,720
and the super medium values of course

277
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,959
compared to the first column in the

278
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,760
second column this someone degrees can

279
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,680
be observed uh

280
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,600
as well as ron suggested it's very

281
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,560
likely due to the effect of the cache

282
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,600
because

283
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,040
the first column

284
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,120
the level three cache

285
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,640
have some but but no more after but from

286
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,040
the second column in the consecutive

287
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,079
columns the values are very very stable

288
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,000
of course there are very little decrease

289
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
in the last but one column and there's

290
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,560
some decrease at the last column of

291
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,800
course because uh i couldn't increase

292
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,079
any more uh the hash table size and of

293
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,680
course there were no

294
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,560
numeral issues so for this reason

295
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,399
there was some degradation but in

296
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,200
general we can say that using hashing we

297
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,079
can we can make a good scalability of

298
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,720
course it's also true that a state

299
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,120
corporation has it as its price we have

300
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,240
seen it in the cpu core scalability and

301
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,000
also we can see it here because it

302
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,480
requires a lot of memory so with other

303
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,600
solutions uh we don't need such amount

304
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,399
of memory and we can also see that when

305
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,079
we are approaching the limits of the

306
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,120
system for example when we use

307
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,320
memory

308
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,639
then it's a problem and

309
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,680
it

310
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,440
becomes a bit a bit

311
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,519
lower performance so this is the price

312
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,440
of of

313
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,360
stateful operation

314
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,760
so i had i have prepared uh another

315
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,320
slide with my questions

316
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,279
and

317
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,200
my question is

318
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,880
what's your opinion

319
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,680
are these results useful and sufficient

320
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,320
for network operators so using these

321
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,440
results you could make a good decision

322
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,880
and

323
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,040
even it is more important that will the

324
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
same method be appropriate for a

325
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,959
stateful nad six force capability

326
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,839
measurements because uh if you say it's

327
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,839
okay that i

328
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,600
start

329
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,480
with

330
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,880
measurements with that and the first

331
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,639
implementation is jew

332
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,320
what do you think of jewel is it a

333
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,480
bright idea to test the jewel

334
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,519
so that's it and i'd like to ask for

335
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,160
your feedback

336
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
okay thank you very much

337
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,800
and i'll be looking for

338
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,839
hands raised

339
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,160
jail is your hand raised to make a

340
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,399
comment on gabors

341
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,320
or you the next presenter

342
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,320
are there any comments on gabor's

343
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,959
presentation

344
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,880
okay i don't see any

345
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,720
so we will move on to the next

346
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,240
presentation

347
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,160
but before we do that i'll note that uh

348
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,959
fred baker seems to be having some

349
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,040
uh problems connecting i see him coming

350
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,720
in and coming out

351
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,880
uh coming in and dropping off

352
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,000
so gabor if you could stop sharing

353
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,360
yes

354
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,680
okay thank you

355
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,480
and

356
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,399
zhao

357
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,760
yes you could start sharing

358
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,519
there we go

359
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,959
deck is loading

360
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,839
there it is go ahead

361
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,800
okay thank you everybody

362
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
i'm here to present

363
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,760
hours you have the nd deployment draft

364
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,519
and the title of the giraffe is

365
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,920
isolating holes in layer 2 and layer 3

366
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,079
to simplifying the

367
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,320
first hop deployment

368
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,680
from the

369
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,560
comments of uh ted lemon

370
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,079
we realized that this title may

371
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,199
lead people to believe that we

372
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,480
present a new solution in this draft

373
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,880
which is not the case this is a

374
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,040
deployment guideline draft so all the

375
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,440
solutions they that you have discussed

376
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,279
you know are existing you know rfcs so

377
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,000
this is the first clarification i would

378
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,519
like to

379
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,279
make

380
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,920
also the title may lead people to

381
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,240
believe that we favor

382
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,480
layer 2 and layer 3

383
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,120
holds isolation all the time

384
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,839
this also not the case

385
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,199
we

386
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,040
we

387
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,959
advocate layer 2 and layer 3 isolation

388
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,279
only in the suitable cases and the gif

389
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,959
clearly say that oh

390
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,360
you know in what cases

391
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,240
isolation is suitable and in what cases

392
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,959
isolation are not suitable so

393
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,759
this is the first two clarification that

394
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,399
i would like to make about the draft

395
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,240
so

396
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,240
first i would like to talk about why we

397
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,759
want to

398
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,440
write such a draft it's because we

399
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,759
realized that mainly operators are

400
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,440
finally starting to deploy ipv6

401
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,800
so

402
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,199
in this process they

403
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,199
started to you know care a lot more

404
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,760
about neighbor discovery

405
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,839
and they

406
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,079
find that there are mainly

407
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,640
the issues and solutions are distributed

408
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,439
in many rfc and they will have to read

409
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,480
many ifcs in order to

410
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,640
to understand all the xcus and get

411
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,480
comfortable with nd

412
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,199
so from talking with them we decided

413
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,599
that it can be useful to collect all the

414
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,840
issues and solutions

415
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,679
into a single place for easy reference

416
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,600
we acknowledge that rfc 6583 and

417
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,880
recently 1999

418
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,000
helps

419
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,720
because these two rfcs did talk about

420
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,200
nd excuse the second rfc actually talk

421
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,520
about ipv6 security excuse about it

422
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,799
covers some anti-issues but nevertheless

423
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,000
they are either a little bit old or

424
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,039
you know

425
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,039
not complete

426
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,799
uh on nt for example uh ifc 1999

427
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,559
actually on cover wing the

428
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,480
wireless nd

429
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,039
so i think that this is one hole that we

430
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,880
are trying to feel

431
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,559
a second one is that currently there are

432
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,200
these rfcs talking about uh nd issues

433
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,320
you know solutions however there is no

434
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,600
draft

435
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,799
saying how to avoid the excuse because

436
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,080
if

437
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,559
you can avoid the excuse then

438
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,880
it will be simpler than you know uh

439
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,280
leading with the xcu and then deploy a

440
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,919
solution to deal with it it's for this

441
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,840
reason that we wrote these draft

442
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,880
and then the work part is kind of like a

443
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,840
simplified table of content

444
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,360
what we did in the graph so in the draft

445
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,400
first we summarize the existing

446
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,919
issues and then we also analyze the

447
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,440
existing

448
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,880
solutions

449
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,760
so i think that this will make it

450
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,240
easier for people who want to you know

451
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,640
kind of like get an overview of all the

452
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,360
nd exclusive solutions

453
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,919
to to have you know basically a single

454
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,840
place to go to

455
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,200
and also

456
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,840
from analyzing the existing solutions

457
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,440
we distilled the

458
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,280
wisdom from these rfcs and we summarized

459
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,080
into a simple sentence that in many

460
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,679
cases if you isolate the host

461
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:36,559
then

462
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,760
it can be you know quite effective in

463
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,080
in preventing the

464
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,880
uh

465
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,000
issues

466
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,200
but also as i said at the beginning

467
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,919
we

468
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,280
recognize that isolating host has its

469
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,320
benefit but also

470
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,880
it can also cause you know issues for

471
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,440
example if you're isolating hosts then

472
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,760
you know if your service you don't rely

473
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,679
on for example

474
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,960
mdns then you know ndns is not going to

475
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,679
work so we do recognize that you know

476
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,159
isolating hose has its you know

477
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,280
applicability some places it's some

478
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,960
places it's not

479
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,400
good so

480
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,320
we to discuss we do discuss you know

481
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,120
where you should be isolating

482
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,919
where

483
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,280
you should not be

484
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,200
this is

485
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,039
the

486
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,600
the second part and then

487
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,880
we realized that you know when you do

488
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,600
this kind of like isolation it may have

489
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,640
an impact on other

490
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,400
components of

491
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,320
ipv6 first hop

492
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,400
so you know including the addressing

493
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,640
scheme you know just now we talked about

494
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,240
uh ndis etc so these are briefly

495
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,919
analyzed in the job as well

496
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,000
so

497
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,679
what's unique in this uh giraffe is that

498
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,679
we are the first one to clearly

499
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,039
distinguish uh l2 isolation and the

500
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,720
unique prefix

501
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,000
host

502
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,159
you know the unique prefix for host you

503
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,640
know some people actually in our draft

504
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,400
we call it l3 uh isolation because from

505
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,559
our discussion you know even among the

506
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,360
co-authors themselves and also

507
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,280
we are seeking uh

508
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,240
private comments from some extras in the

509
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,600
working book

510
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
we find that many people

511
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,400
mix these two things uh together

512
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,880
so l2 isolation is is i think that is

513
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,559
simple right you know it's like putting

514
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,559
a hole for example in a p2p ring or

515
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,960
you know by itself you know isolating

516
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,799
from other hosts

517
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,720
um unique politics

518
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,480
is also simple is

519
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,120
that you know each host get its own

520
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,559
uh

521
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,240
uh subnet or you know prefix some people

522
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,640
kind of feel that oh you know if the

523
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,760
hose is of its own link then it will

524
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,400
equal get also get its own subnet but

525
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,080
this is not the case so here we put on a

526
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,159
picture that we take from ifc 7668

527
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,640
and this picture clearly tells you that

528
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,480
you know in in this picture the 6ln is

529
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,559
the like the sixth low power

530
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,000
node and the six lbi is the router and

531
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,400
here you can see that all the holes are

532
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,799
clearly you know in a point-to-point

533
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,880
link to the router

534
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,480
so you know they are isolated in l2 but

535
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
actually you know uh

536
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,640
ifc 7668 the the author of the rc they

537
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,400
decided that you know for whatever

538
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,640
reasons it's better to put all of these

539
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,600
in a same subnet so again this is a

540
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,320
clear example like you know uh just

541
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,960
because a node is it's in its own uh p2p

542
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,840
uh for example a p2p link doesn't mean

543
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,840
that you know they will necessarily you

544
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,760
know be you know has its own subnet

545
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,000
and we believe that you know in this

546
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,679
notion if if we clearly distinguish this

547
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,280
it will help

548
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,000
in many discussions because we actually

549
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,280
discover that you know even in rfc

550
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,200
uh

551
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,000
8273 which is the unique prefix per host

552
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
rfc it's kind of like you know uh

553
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,280
implicitly increasingly assuming that

554
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,039
you know okay you know the holes are

555
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,039
isolated in l2

556
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,279
strictly speaking strictly speaking you

557
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,400
know there's corner cases where you know

558
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,360
the the holes may not be isolated or

559
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,440
vice versa we also find that you know

560
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,600
there are some other drafts

561
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,240
which you know is advocating layer to

562
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,679
isolation

563
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,679
for example p2p ethernet and

564
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,799
the author assumes that you know it will

565
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,159
automatically imply the uh unique prefix

566
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,279
per host we would just like to to point

567
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,200
out that you know there are corner cases

568
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,559
like this one

569
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,600
where these two things are different

570
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,000
so i think that you know this is this

571
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,200
may be a good notion for people to

572
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,320
for easier understanding of uh nd

573
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,559
and then we

574
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,360
we clearly in this graph we clearly

575
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,320
analyzed the pros and cons of

576
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
both l2 isolation

577
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,520
and unique prefix per path and where

578
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,919
they are applicable and i would like to

579
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,559
especially mention that

580
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,600
when

581
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
the unique prefix

582
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,799
host

583
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,720
before it become rfc

584
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,159
8273 there was actually a lengthy debate

585
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,840
about the the merit of a unique prefix

586
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,400
per host and at that time you know many

587
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,120
experts you know expressed uh

588
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,720
very good you know inside about uh nd

589
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,679
but

590
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,440
the those inside are dispersed in you

591
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,080
know more than 100 messages

592
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,200
um

593
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,279
you know it's not easy for people to get

594
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,840
because people may read rfc but they may

595
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,480
not go back to you know historic male

596
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,000
archives

597
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,559
so you know while we are writing this

598
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,760
job you know we go to this xcu and then

599
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,960
we carefully read all those uh messages

600
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,600
and we also summarize the valuable

601
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,279
insight from

602
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,919
you know a hundred plus

603
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,960
messages into the app again i think that

604
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,000
this will help people to

605
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,880
uh to get some of the the insight from

606
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,440
the expert and this also you know help

607
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,480
them you know understand uh the pros and

608
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,279
cons of unique uh prefix per power per

609
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,400
host data so this is another one and

610
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,120
overall overall this you have to discuss

611
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,679
you know how to avoid ndx use and then

612
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,240
to provide deployment guidelines we

613
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,520
believe that

614
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,080
this is useful service to the community

615
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,360
and then

616
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,600
on my last slide

617
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,919
i would like to give some a suggestion

618
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,080
on how to reading the draft because it's

619
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,520
along our

620
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,919
the the mailing list

621
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,679
a couple of people

622
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,159
have read the draft but we believe that

623
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,799
many people may still have not

624
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,159
have a chance to read it so

625
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,360
based on uh discussion with other uh

626
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,159
commenters we realized that

627
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,360
uh

628
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,600
again you know some people think

629
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,960
because of

630
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,919
the title that we are advocating host

631
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,200
isolation everywhere um

632
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,000
then

633
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,240
i think that people may get alienated

634
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,360
you know about the job immediately but

635
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,679
here i'd like to clearly clarify that

636
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,760
this is not the case we realized that

637
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,480
you know again host legislation has its

638
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,320
marriage somewhere but you know may have

639
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,880
disadvantages otherwise so you know it's

640
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,360
only you know we we do have some

641
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,000
guidelines on where to apply this host

642
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,080
isolation and then you know it's

643
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,559
important not to assume that

644
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,559
l2 isolation

645
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,679
automatically imply a unique prefix per

646
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,559
path these are two different things

647
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,799
because if you feel that these are the

648
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,279
same thing then our journey may appear a

649
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,000
little uh confusing like okay you know

650
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,760
why you are you are kind of like

651
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,039
treating them differently and also

652
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,240
we recognize that ng is a very

653
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,240
complex practical

654
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,320
you know when talk about nd it's very

655
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,399
easy to make mistakes

656
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,039
we also acknowledge or at least you know

657
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,799
i don't want to speak for michael

658
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,120
authors but you know at least for myself

659
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,600
i'm not a well-known nd cast in the

660
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,720
expert

661
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
like some of the people in this working

662
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,120
group so sometimes you know people may

663
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,559
think that oh you know

664
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,399
when they have a disagreement when they

665
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,159
have a disagreement they say that oh you

666
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,279
know these guys are you know uh newbies

667
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,720
and they know what they are talking

668
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,440
about now here i would just like to uh

669
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,520
highlight that we think many months of

670
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,600
fact checking at the end of the day we

671
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,679
may still make some mistakes but we

672
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,880
shouldn't be making uh

673
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,360
two obvious mistakes so you know please

674
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,000
give us some benefit of doubt

675
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,919
bear with us a little bit

676
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,120
and with that i would like to

677
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,520
say to the community that please review

678
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,840
and comment we will really

679
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,000
appreciate that because we put a lot of

680
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,640
effort and we believe that this is this

681
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,600
draft is is a good service to the

682
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,480
community we didn't we didn't

683
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,039
advocate any solution so we don't we

684
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,039
don't have our own agenda we just want

685
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,640
to you know help people understand uh nd

686
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,360
easier and would like to thank you know

draft we welcome your contribution and

697
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,960
you know if you want to be a co-author

698

thank you

700
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,799
well thank you very much and i see a few

701
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,240
people in the queue

702
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,559
dave

703
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,679
all right yeah so uh good presentation

704
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,279
so thanks for putting your efforts into

705
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,640
this um i think my comment is related to

706
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,440
uh your original point about it's really

707
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,679
hard to find um all the information

708
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,039
because it's scattered around a bunch of

709
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,279
drastic you don't know where to look um

710
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,320
my comment is that there's an ieb rfc

711
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,919
that i think would be good to reference

712
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,120
and that's rfc 4903 which is called

713
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,200
multi-link subnet issues right that's

714
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,760
what the ieb did an evaluation of the

715
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,600
issues around multi-link subnets and at

716
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,760
least wrote those up right it again did

717
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,720
not

718
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,000
i guess you can read it and decide

719
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,120
whether you think it actually makes any

720
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,880
recommendations or if it just highlights

721
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,399
issues right and so

722
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,159
i think it's another good uh reference

723
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,679
to add to your list because it will

724
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:30,880
point out some of the things that you're

725
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,399
pointing out and maybe some other ones

726
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,520
that you don't have in your draft since

727
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,120
i haven't i scanned through your draft

728
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
but i didn't read all of it uh but i did

729
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,320
look at your list of references and

730
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,840
noticed it wasn't in there so i just

731
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,679
wanted to highlight uh that draft and

732
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,120
suggest that you add that one is another

733
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,039
one of your references just to your

734
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,399
point that it's really hard to find all

735
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,039
the right places to look so

736
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,640
okay thank you dave 4903 actually you

737
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,640
know uh in in our in our writing uh we

738
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,000
actually uh did come across that one so

739
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,120
we will

740
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,279
think about it and then add it to the to

741
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,840
the reference

742
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,279
thank you dad

743
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,080
okay nalini

744
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,480
nalini will have to push the microphone

745
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,440
button so we can hear you

746
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,159
hello

747
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,000
ah now we can hear you

748
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,480
okay okay great yes thank you so much

749
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,720
for doing this work um

750
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
that i'm working with lots of

751
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,559
enterprises we've been trying to get

752
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,320
them to um

753
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,000
implement this is big area of confusion

754
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,640
um and uh problems and so uh we will i

755
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,440
will have uh people that i know

756
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,600
very large implementations also take a

757
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,240
look at this and see from from uh you

758
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,120
know private managed networks see where

759
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,440
this makes sense and we will give you

760
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,000
feedback but thank you for doing this

761
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,519
thank you very much lily

762
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,200
jen

763
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,720
hello

764
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,960
yeah thanks a lot for doing this very

765
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,960
interesting and

766
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,159
i'm particularly interested in

767
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,519
uh

768
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,840
think about um

769
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,320
what you call learn to isolation i'm

770
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,240
just curious

771
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,039
if you say talk about something like

772
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,440
private villains when from router

773
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,120
perspective it's still a single

774
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
interface right and it's just your

775
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,760
switching infrastructure preventing

776
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,840
peer-to-peer communication

777
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,480
i assume this still does not prevent an

778
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,039
attacker from doing

779
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,440
from poisoning neighbor discovery cash

780
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,279
on a router right because nothing

781
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,039
prevent host a

782
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,640
start sending

783
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,760
nas

784
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,440
with host b

785
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,440
addresses right even if they cannot talk

786
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,600
to each other they both can send traffic

787
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,159
to a router so i'm just curious how

788
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,519
alert to isolation in this case helps

789
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,559
with

790
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,679
uh ng-related issues but if it's

791
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,600
different interfaces from router

792
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,159
perspective right i'm curious how well

793
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,240
it would scale because you might have

794
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,080
like thousands of hosts in vlan

795
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,200
currently

796
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
and if you start creating

797
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,519
interfaces on a router for each host i'm

798
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,840
just i don't know if it exists because

799
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,760
if i

800
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,120
look at this from enterprise perspective

801
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,840
i have a vlan currently and i would like

802
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,640
to see something like prefix per host

803
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,240
and so on but i am not sure that

804
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,720
technology actually exists

805
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,039
i'm just curious if you know about

806
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,600
implementation of those things in like

807
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,840
normal routing switching environment and

808
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,320
if yes yet would be very would be very

809
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,240
interesting to see like deployment

810
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,519
recommendations because i've never like

811
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,960
come across anything like that

812
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,559
yes

813
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,039
thank you very much for your for your

814
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,159
comments

815
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,560
um i think that you are you are right i

816
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,639
have two feedback

817
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,520
the first feedback is regarding

818
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,280
uh okay so

819
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,199
if you do the l2 isolation first you may

820
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,119
require many interfaces

821
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,599
second

822
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,399
even if you do the the l2 isolation

823
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,040
you know other

824
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,119
other hopes in another p2p link may

825
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,679
still poison the router

826
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,399
i completely agree with you i completely

827
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,719
agree with you so

828
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,760
my first feedback would be

829
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,440
just because you do l2 isolation doesn't

830
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,399
mean that you know you you automatically

831
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,320
solve mainly nd probe

832
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,720
when you do for example no matter l2

833
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,560
isolation or unique prefix per host

834
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,440
actually you also need to enhance

835
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,200
the router

836
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,440
otherwise you know just isolation

837
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,280
themselves you know may solve some

838
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,119
problem but

839
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,359
does not solve all the problems like

840
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,400
what you uh just uh mentioned

841
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,920
so

842
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,000
i think that what i'm trying to say is

843
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,119
that if we look at the l2 isolation and

844
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,440
also unique prefix per

845
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,400
host

846
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,200
all of these also require that the

847
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,160
router have additional functionality

848
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,119
for the you know uh final solution to be

849
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,000
clean

850
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,359
if the if you just do the l2 isolation

851
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,560
or you you you do unique prefix per host

852
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,960
but if you don't enhance the router then

853
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,079
that is that there's still many problems

854
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,599
will remain

855
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,880
for example if we look at uh

856
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,680
the l2 isolation case which i think that

857
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,440
you know if we look at which solution uh

858
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,680
make use of this one i'll say that you

859
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,520
know a case in point that would be the

860
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,160
width you know the wireless nd

861
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,079
and the wireless nd actually you know

862
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,839
introduce quite some you know new

863
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,560
functionality into it in order to you

864
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,800
know avoid some of the problems that you

865
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,200
just mentioned i think that this is my

866
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,520
my first response and

867
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,240
the second response regarding the

868
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,320
introducing of for example many

869
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,839
interfaces

870
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,200
this may be

871
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,160
the case and this may be something you

872
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,960
know

873
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,400
undesirable but you know in our draft

874
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,640
it's largely uh

875
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,359
uh we talk about the you know where it's

876
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,240
appropriate where it's not appropriate

877
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,760
and if you know introducing too many

878
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,040
uh

879
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,839
interfaces become a problem then i think

880
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,760
that you know in our journal we will

881
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,839
recommend that you don't do it

882
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:03,759
i i i hope i respond to your your points

883
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,720
i mostly yes i'm just curious when

884
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,640
you're saying you need to enhance your

885
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,400
router you basically are you saying

886
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,560
about any existing technology which

887
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,440
could be deployed by a random enterprise

888
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,960
are you talking about something which

889
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,280
doesn't really exist currently

890
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,280
well if again if we go back to the

891
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,599
to the the debate uh before uppx

892
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,520
become a rfc

893
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,359
i think that

894
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,040
the

895
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,920
the people

896
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,079
for example i think that the author of

897
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,920
ifc uh

898
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,320
8273

899
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,560
they say that

900
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,040
the implementation exists

901
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,400
however how exactly was the super

902
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,040
implementation be was actually not

903
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,480
clearly specified in any rfc

904
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,839
so personally i believe that

905
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,040
this

906
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,200
implementation for example

907
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,920
i think that for l2 isolation

908
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,800
wing clearly specify

909
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,599
what additional functionality the router

910
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,040
or the

911
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,119
host

912
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,280
needed to do for example you know in

913
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,119
wing that you know they specify these

914
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,400
edges

915
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,599
registration but i think that in in in

916
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,599
the case of upp h

917
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,640
the

918
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,920
how what the what exactly the router do

919
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,880
is actually not specified and i actually

920
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,359
feel that uh

921
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,160
maybe

922
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,200
we need a draft and actually always p to

923
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,359
p is the net job personally i think that

924
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,000
you know can actually be the the the

925
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,400
mixing specification of

926
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,040
ifc

927
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,560
8273 i don't know whether oh they agree

928
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,800
to this or not but personally i believe

929
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,839
that

930
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,200
the implementation of

931
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,960
unique prefix

932
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,280
the host is actually mixing it's not

933
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,839
specifying any rfc even though the

934
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,799
vendor may have it

935
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,839
okay thank you

936
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,160
okay eric

937
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,240
i'm slightly concerned by how much wind

938
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,160
has been thrown around in the last few

939
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,200
minutes

940
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,000
uh i also think more generally

941
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,440
uh it's

942
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,960
probably going to be more confusing for

943
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,200
operators to have all the six low stuff

944
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,720
mentioned in here

945
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,960
right wind is um you know i mean i know

946
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,880
pascal's on the call but like

947
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,040
uh

948
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,280
the stateful uh six low stuff the

949
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,280
stateful registration stuff that 6lo

950
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,640
does

951
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,720
was discussed in six man in the past you

952
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,160
might want to go review some of those

953
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,359
discussions

954
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,680
uh it was not adopted as a

955
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,240
uh uh host requirements

956
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,000
uh implementation for for general

957
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,040
purpose wireless right so i i i would

958
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,040
maybe see if there's

959
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,760
maybe i can reconsider uh how and when

960
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,880
to clarify

961
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,280
that you know wireless nd here is

962
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,400
like the stuff that you're calling

963
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,560
wireless nd is six load specific at the

964
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,480
moment

965
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
okay and i think it's probably going to

966
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,640
be confusing when

967
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,800
operators find out that there is no

968
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,720
uh wireless nd address registration

969
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,280
stuff that they can force on 802.11

970
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,880
enterprise networks for example or that

971
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,200
hosts don't implement it at all

972
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,040
for example

973
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,960
thank you eric for the information i

974
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,119
think that this is a 6l and

975
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,920
i put it in this slide but it's actually

976
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,680
knocking the in the uf but in the

977
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
journal we did talk about you know uh

978
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,560
wing that the few rfc is like

979
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,319
uh already

980
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,680
uh

981
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,800
published by the ietf um

982
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,960
i think that maybe i will i will talk to

983
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,119
you uh offline

984
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,119
to see how to address your concept

985
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,720
so yeah this this six little diagram

986
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,480
doesn't appear in the in the draft but

987
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,160
like there's lots and lots of wind

988
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,319
recommendations it it looks like the

989
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,800
to me it looks like the draft sort of

990
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,359
um

991
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,119
yeah i mean you you do mention it that

992
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,440
it's appropriate for for six low cases

993
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,200
for lln cases

994
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,079
but um i'm like not entirely sure it's

995
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,839
going to be clear to an operator that

996
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,240
this stuff is not available for like

997
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,920
laptops and whatever generally speaking

998
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,680
yes but

999
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,920
i'm just thinking that some operators

1000
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,359
are starting to do this iot

1001
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,000
um

1002
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,319
i i must at the mid back you know i am

1003
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:40,160
not an expert here so maybe i i

1004
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,160
do some you know offline discussion with

1005
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,400
you to to see how to address your

1006
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,880
concern

1007
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,520
fair enough and here's pascal

1008
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,599
thanks

1009
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,079
pascal

1010
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,280
yes but you are breaking up

1011
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,920
yes it's because of my source i'm sorry

1012
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,480
um yeah i think we never really resolved

1013
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,680
whether uh well snd is applicable to to

1014
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,680
propose i mean there were very few

1015
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,520
discussions there was never a call for

1016
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,640
adoption

1017
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,640
uh uh really there was not enough

1018
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,760
discussion to to justify that any

1019
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,480
discussion any decision was actually

1020
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,800
taken

1021
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,680
and really we we would need to study the

1022
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,839
prime at six man which was never done

1023
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,079
okay why don't i propose that um

1024
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,079
the three of you uh

1025
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,240
eric pascal

1026
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,560
um

1027
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,800
all get together and discuss whether

1028
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,119
wind should be uh in jail i'll discuss

1029
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,480
whether uh

1030
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,280
wind should be included or not

1031
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,160
or you know how it should be

1032
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,079
past cloud

1033
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,119
yeah

1034
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,680
that uh also there are

1035
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,720
a number of new documents which extend

1036
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,400
the same registration mechanism of our

1037
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,560
different technologies the most recent

1038
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,760
is evpn so yes it could really be

1039
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,280
something very useful to ipv6

1040
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,760
okay eric

1041
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,920
i think it's fair to include it um i

1042
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,520
just think it's got to be

1043
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,760
highlighted that uh

1044
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,000
for operators that just sort of might

1045
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,280
assume that this is the way that this is

1046
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,640
an option that's available to them or a

1047
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,319
knob they can turn on when that's not

1048
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,400
necessarily generally the case

1049
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,720
okay

1050
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,079
thank you any more comments

1051
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,839
okay thank you jeff

1052
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,280
and that is the end of our presentations

1053
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,480
for the day

1054
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,440
i have

1055
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,040
wanted well first we have any more

1056
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,720
general comments about anything for the

1057
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,118
working group

1058
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:59,440
okay looks like we're all happy campers

1059
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,440
i have one announcement before i close

1060
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,800
down the meeting

1061
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,480
and that's that we will have a second

1062
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,119
session tomorrow about the future of the

1063
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,280
ipv6 hop by op

1064
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,800
extension header

1065
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,720
that will be a joint session with six

1066
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,920
man

1067
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,280
um i think we're all aware of the

1068
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,119
current condition of the hop by hop

1069
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,400
extension header um

1070
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,680
many many

1071
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,839
providers drop packets that contain hop

1072
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,319
by hop because it can be used as a dos

1073
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,240
attack

1074
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,359
um

1075
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,760
we're finding some new uses for it but

1076
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,560
we really can't use it because of uh

1077
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,200
its status is a dos vector

1078
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,000
so

1079
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,400
there will be a joint meeting between v6

1080
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,599
ops and six men tomorrow to discuss

1081
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,280
discuss how we can fix that problem

1082
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,960
with that said um

1083
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,800
we have a few more minutes if anybody

1084
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,720
has a topic to bring up

1085
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,759
i'll wait for the queue

1086
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,240
looks like nothing there

1087
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,160
so i'll see you all on the mailing list

1088
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,400
uh i believe i have one action item to

1089
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,800
start a working group last call for the

1090
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,200
boys and draft craft

1091
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,480
and you should all see that on the

1092
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,800
mailing list monday

1093
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,960
take care all and i'll close down the

1094
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,720
