i had to go and put um

6
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,519
put some headphones on because i've

7
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,599
noticed meat echo is a little bit less

8
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,238
forgiving with um

9
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,840
feedback um

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,880

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,480
usually i do the whole thing with

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,719

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,359
um

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,760

this is the irtf note well notice this

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,920
is the irdf not the ietf although the

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,240
irtf does follow the ietf intellectual

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,479
property rates disclosure rules uh it is

32
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,640
thursday i am assuming that most of you

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,960
have already seen this by now but if not

34
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,720
here it is uh if you don't know what

35
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,880
this is please read and understand it

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,280
so uh for participants keep your audio

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,799
and video off unless you were speaking

38
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,960
it is recommended to wear headphones you

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,720
can see i just got some that

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,280
recommendation is indeed worth following

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,560
um

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,560
to speak uh please join the queue with

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,439
your turn

44
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,840
then send audio and video i don't know

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,960
if you

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,280
do there's like different versions of

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,640
this i know for ripe if you click on

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,159
video so the next version of meat echo

49
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,040
if you click on video it will

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,399
automatically turn on audio which will

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,719
be nice for itf 113.

52
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,759
um leave the q a done uh and yeah if you

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,280
can't hear us turn off your vpn there's

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,919
apparently been some vpn problems

55
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,878
um

56
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,560
all of the slides have been added to the

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,800
um

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,959
added to

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,720
meet echo so you can actually share

60
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,959
pre-loaded slides use that button and

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,800
pick your presentation when you are a

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,360
presenter

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,560
uh wanted minutes taker i think we

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,239
actually have a minutes taker uh

65
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,720
thank you very much

66
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,080
corey

67
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,319
uh here's our agenda uh i'm going to

68
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,480
ramble on for a few minutes uh about the

69
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,440
ieb review then we will have uh

70
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,280
uh recent cyril talking about a

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,400
vocabulary vocabulary path properties

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,959
uh nicholas on satellite networks uh

73
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,480
spencer to talk about some multi-pass

74
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,959
selection strategies uh and then we have

75
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,080
um

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,519
a bit of open nike time which i think

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,159
we've we've never had before um we

78
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,519
generally have scheduled these things to

79
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,040
be short and then we get an agenda that

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,120
is very long and we have to tell people

81
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,560
i'm sorry there's not enough time and

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,920
this time we decided we're going to fix

83
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,760
that by having an agenda that is long

84
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,120
and we have some open mic time so

85
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,040
anything that comes up you know from the

86
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,120
review stuff or you know discussion of

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,519
multipath or whatever um we have that

88
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,760
time to discuss there

89
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,360
um yeah

90
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,280
and i i think i made a mistake and if

91
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
you actually have 40 minutes for open

92
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,879
mic not 10.

93
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,080
oh so yes indeed just ignore this yes

94
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,200
yes

95
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,360
and

96
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,080
good good so uh what's going on uh the

97
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,040
irtf pan-rg questions draft is i think

98
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,920
waiting on the document shepard

99
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,560
uh as i recall we were going to

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
double triple check

101
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,640
um

102
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,000
uh

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,360
whether steven was okay with the outcome

104
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,879
of the discussion

105
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,640
uh off the iesg conflict review uh we

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,200
are also i believe waiting on me

107
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,239
to

108
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,400
take one last bit of feedback from gory

109
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
together with

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,360
uh

111
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,519
some feedback that's already in github

112
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,400
and roll a new draft version which

113
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,238
i guess i can do today during the open

114
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,120
mic

115
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,478
um

116
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,279
and

117
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,400
uh yeah so we do have the iotf energy

118
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,560
path properties an active research group

119
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,919
um document we will uh talk about that

120
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,479
that is uh the next

121
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,160
um presentation

122
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,720
uh and then uh we have since the last

123
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,759
meeting had an iab review of

124
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,800
uh the research group uh on that see

125
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,440
next slide

126
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,320
hmm what happened to the slide no

127
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,479
uh uh me

128
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,360
ah me here we go got it

129
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,000
all right so uh you know

130
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
occasionally the um let me see if

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
there's any iad members in the room uh

132
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,639
ah i'm area uh occasionally the iv um

133
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,639
will uh review research groups to make

134
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,440
sure you know one that the they're sort

135
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,960
of in line with other things that are

136
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,080
happening in the architecture happening

137
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,440
in the irsd

138
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,199
uh or uh or either irtf or in the ietf

139
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,400
uh we did this review um

140
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,720
in september october or october uh with

141
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,120
the iv and we had

142
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,840
uh coming out of that um

143
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,440
a

144
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,199
set of next steps like what we think we

145
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,199
should do as a research group

146
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,039
um so one is continue answering the

147
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,360
questions right like so uh

148
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,160
the

149
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,880
path properties draft is a a very good

150
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
answer to uh i believe the first

151
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,360
question uh in the fanergy question

152
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,680
stock we have eight others uh we are

153
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,639
seeking

154
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,680
um sort of uh input discussion anything

155
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,440
else that addresses

156
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,479
um

157
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,240
any of those uh um

158
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,840
uh

159
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,360
any of those particular questions right

160
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,960
like so i think this is a relatively

161
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,840
open-ended uh area for discussion

162
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,160
we should also consider uh sort of the

163
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,319
other direction um

164
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,919
so considering research like taking

165
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,680
things and moving them back into the itf

166
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,759
so the research applications of

167
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,039
um

168
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,360
pan properties to itf protocols so a

169
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,720
good example here is uh spencer um we'll

170
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,080
be talking about the multi-path

171
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,800
selection strategies work later

172
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,000
um

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,400
there is uh remains some overlap uh

174
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,440
between uh pan and alto

175
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,880
uh there is i think some more

176
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,720
research-oriented follow-up work from

177
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,960
alto from altus recharter uh we have

178
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,400
reached out to them to invite them to

179
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,319
come to pan rg and

180
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,440
uh

181
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,400
consider continuing that work here um

182
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,039
and i think that one of the big bits of

183
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,560
value that we as a research group

184
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,880
provide uh is

185
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,039
um

186
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,039
operating as a general venue in uh

187
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,759
in the ietf space of the irtf you know

188
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,880
and it's

189
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,000
where we're

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,400
uh exploiting that that adjacency to the

191
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,599
ietf

192
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,479
um

193
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,160
to be a good place to talk about the

194
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,400
intersections between routing uh and

195
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,880
transport uh through the internet layer

196
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,840
uh and you know so we these discussions

197
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,599
have come up time and time again sort of

198
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,520
in the the ietf and there's like a lot

199
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,039
of feedback hey this looks more like a

200
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,240
research question

201
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,280
um we're there as a venue to um

202
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,720
uh

203
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,080
to

204
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,400
discuss that if there are other things

205
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,000
that you think that we should be doing

206
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,360
or if you think that we should not be

207
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,199
doing any of these things

208
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,280
um we have 40 minutes of open mic time

209
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,199
to discuss that uh

210
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,360
after the rest of today's agenda

211
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,280
moving on

212
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,800
um i think it's the last slide so

213
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,960
oh yeah moving on

214
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,720
uh so then the uh

215
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,520
next presenter uh either rhys or cyril

216
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,840
come on up

217
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,479
yes i am about to request sharing slides

218
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,479
at least that's what i clicked

219
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,000
but it's not coming uh i oh here we go

220
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,800
vocabulary

221
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,520
okay uh hi folks uh this is rhys i go by

222
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,280
teresa on my publication so that's

223
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,680
what's showing up on the slide um

224
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,479
and i'll be talking about the vocabulary

225
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,519
of path properties draft we updated this

226
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,240
draft prior to ietf112

227
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,279
with two significant changes first

228
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,600
change is we revised the entity

229
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,080
definition as we got feedback that our

230
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,320
previous definition was too generic so

231
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,680
now we

232
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,560
verbalize what do all entities as used

233
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
in this document have in common and they

234
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,560
have in common that they play a role

235
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,720
related to pathway networking for

236
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,839
particular paths and flows and what role

237
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,640
can this be uh for example it can relate

238
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,360
to

239
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,120
a data plane or control plane

240
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,279
functionality is one way to think about

241
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,000
it

242
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,760
and those two terms are also worth

243
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,560
defining so we took a step by saying a

244
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,360
data plane means the entity participates

245
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,480
in forwarding of flows across paths and

246
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
control plane means the entity

247
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,279
influences aspects of how forwarding

248
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,080
happens and in that case if the entity

249
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,640
influences forwarding it usually is

250
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,680
aware of path properties to inform its

251
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,839
decisions and i guess critically an

252
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,440
entity can be

253
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,519
broader it can be on path or off the

254
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,000
path but if it's a node it is an on path

255
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,399
entity

256
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,920
second

257
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,320
significant change is that we made the

258
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,560
transparency definition more formal uh

259
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,279
modeling at it as a function f

260
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,360
and the inputs to this function are a

261
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,000
flow capital f and some meta information

262
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,240
m and the output of the function is an

263
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,120
action a taken by a node so if the

264
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,000
output of f is constant regardless of

265
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,800
the input value m then the node is

266
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,360
transparent or in other words if a is

267
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,680
not impacted by m the node is

268
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,399
transparent to the flow f with respect

269
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,480
to the meta information m

270
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,200
for example if a the action is always

271
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,399
constant given arbitrary m then that is

272
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,160
transparent so this allows one to

273
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,279
formally prove transparency by proving

274
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,880
that the function's output does not

275
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,279
change if one wanted to do so and one

276
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,519
can even do a formal taint analysis

277
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,200
which is something that

278
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,640
was brought up in the chat during the

279
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,200
last session we could show that m the

280
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,720
meta information does not taint or

281
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,800
impact the output of f

282
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,120
to define a transparency

283
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,680
and now moving forward and this is

284
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,839
already my last slide

285
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,079
we have now had multiple instances i

286
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,079
think of the research group wanting to

287
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,480
publish other documents and then getting

288
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,200
feedback or getting questions about the

289
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,040
term about some terms in those other

290
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,519
documents that were not well defined for

291
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,600
example what is a path what is control

292
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,240
plane um and this led to asking if we

293
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,399
can define those terms in this document

294
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,760
in the vocabulary of path properties um

295
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,560
and uh yeah i guess for the documents

296
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,320
that we are publishing or have published

297
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
so far it's they those sort of proceed

298
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,240
the path properties draft so it's hard

299
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
to depend on the path properties draft

300
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,160
but i think with um

301
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,880
especially with documents that are sort

302
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,680
of

303
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,440
still in progress in the working group

304
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,560
there is a good opportunity to

305
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,279
define key terms that are used in other

306
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,200
path properties draft so we actually had

307
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,800
a question about a routing domain

308
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,320
identifier

309
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,920
which i think

310
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,920
is going to be

311
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,760
used in the next iteration of the

312
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,200
questions draft

313
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,959
but it's not yet defined in the path

314
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,560
properties draft but maybe we want to

315
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,399
define it in here

316
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,880
and then maybe there's also more terms

317
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,399
that we need to define so i was curious

318
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,320
what does the research group think what

319
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,399
terms merit defining in this path

320
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,639
properties document

321
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,880
and also in more generally how can this

322
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,200
document be useful to the research group

323
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,600
sorry i had a headphone failure so i had

324
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,399
to go

325
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,600
fix the thing spencer

326
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,360
yeah um thank you thank you all for your

327
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,079
continued work on this draft and uh and

328
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,440
uh

329
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,680
i'm finding it more and more helpful as

330
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
we go along um

331
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,639
so uh two things one uh i put in the uh

332
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,079
the uh

333
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,839
issue about uh

334
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:56,880
the

335
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,200
routing domain identifier term

336
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,160
um

337
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,720
but i noticed that the

338
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,880
uh i did i noticed that the draft itself

339
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,040
did not have a pointer to the github

340
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,880
repo

341
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,120
so

342
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,519
i also put in an issue for that

343
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,560
uh if if that could happen i you know i

344
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,040
found i'm finding that to be

345
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,600
as predicted very helpful for getting

346
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,839
input from um

347
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,920
for more people than

348
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,160
we i i was getting on things before i

349
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,240
put things in get a repos

350
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,519
so

351
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,680
that would be that would be awesome and

352
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,880
uh thank you for uh looking at the

353
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,720
routing

354
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,519
uh

355
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,519
routing domain identifier

356
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,160
i had um

357
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,959
so

358
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,519
defining terms that are used in other

359
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,199
pan-rg drafts uh i think is a really

360
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,959
good exercise

361
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,599
the one the one caution i would give is

362
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,399
i was using there's a lot of terminology

363
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,120
in the um

364
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,959
in the uh

365
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,519
impediments to deployment rsc

366
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,440
that uh was terminology from the time

367
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,680
and so i don't think that i don't think

368
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,040
that especially the contribution section

369
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,519
of that draft is especially good for

370
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,639
that

371
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,959
but um

372
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,399
more broadly you know if there's

373
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,800
anything else that uh

374
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,639
comes out that uh we look at that's in

375
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,519
uh

376
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,839
pathology questions

377
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:38,880
uh

378
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,959
adding you know and doesn't have an

379
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,440
obvious wide widely understood uh

380
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,320
meaning

381
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,480
those would be awesome to add

382
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
um

383
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,920
but um

384
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,920
let me stop let me stop there uh because

385
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,320
i'm mostly talking i mostly talked to

386
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,600
the first bullet let me let people talk

387
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,680
to the other bullets

388
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,880
and and thank you

389
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
sure thanks and i will absolutely be

390
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760
adding an appointer to the guitar

391
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,399
repository

392
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,199
so i guess i will add myself to the

393
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,079
queue as a uh as an individual

394
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,279
um and try to address the second

395
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,279
question um because sort of the the

396
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,600
um

397
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,519
i i've come to realize that sort of the

398
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,040
exercise of this document is to

399
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
um do a

400
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,959
recursive traversal

401
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,360
of the space of vocabulary that you need

402
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,800
to understand what the properties of a

403
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,480
path are right like so it's like you

404
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,839
know okay we define this and then we

405
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,120
define this and then we define this in

406
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,639
terms of this we need to know what

407
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,160
control plane is when you

408
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,000
know what dating play or uh data plane

409
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
is the

410
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,320
um

411
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,160
the problem like i mean like there's

412
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,920
there's a there's a very clear boundary

413
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,279
between things that you need to define

414
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,600
and things that you don't when you're

415
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,279
you know depth first reversing all of

416
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,639
language right like you're not going to

417
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,920
get to the bottom

418
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,600
um

419
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,839
the

420
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,040
and i'm trying to think of a good sort

421
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
of like way to know that you can stop

422
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,480
and and one way to know that you can

423
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,560
stop is when you can reference

424
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,920
some other

425
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,759
existing definition of something right

426
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,959
like so

427
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,639
um

428
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,399
uh i think there's probably some

429
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,160
terminology around transport protocols

430
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,600
or around network layer protocols that

431
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,839
are in the the the referencing documents

432
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,959
there i think we should be

433
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,279
um

434
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,240
cautious about trying to you know

435
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,000
define what is a node or what is an

436
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
endpoint or these things that are

437
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,839
are sort of like

438
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:54,880
like

439
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,600
used in many places as

440
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,360
shorthand for the thing that we care

441
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,240
about right like so the the and then get

442
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,040
have

443
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,079
in multiple contacts different

444
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,559
definitions right like so

445
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,720
the

446
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,000
i very much like the precision uh that

447
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,679
we have of sort of transp on that

448
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,119
definition of transparency right like

449
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,839
that's that i think is the right level

450
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,640
of

451
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,319
of definition here but where we go in

452
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,520
sort of like the the broad scope

453
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,160
i i i don't have a good metric for for

454
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,640
knowing when we're done um

455
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,360
so i would probably advise to fall back

456
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,559
on

457
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,400
the metric that we use in the rest of

458
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
the ietf which is

459
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
uh

460
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,880
work on it until you arbitrarily think

461
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,720
you're done and then call for last call

462
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,000
and then people will come out of the

463
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,919
woodwork um and then work on the last

464
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,320
call comments

465
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,240
i i apologize that i could not do better

466
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,080
than that but i will stop talking

467
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,400
because someone else isn't you

468
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,400
sabine

469
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,360
uh so i mean you go ahead and ask to

470
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,039
turn on audio slash video

471
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,799
here we go

472
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,200
you know

473
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,440
yes i can hear you

474
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,559
okay

475
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,320
so um

476
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,360
thanks for this work and sorry i did not

477
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,080
read the last uh version

478
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,960
uh but

479
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,600
regarding the point that was raised by

480
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,559
uh brian for example if you take the

481
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,440
definition of an end point

482
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,120
and yes indeed many of these definitions

483
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,679
may have different meanings and also you

484
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,520
can just uh

485
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,240
circle around with the definition did

486
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,400
you consider um

487
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,960
making some of the definitions

488
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,799
relative

489
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,559
to uh context for example an endpoint in

490
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,600
routing may not be the same thing as an

491
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,039
endpoint in transport and uh yet uh

492
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,679
another thing uh than an endpoint for

493
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,640
flows

494
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,039
or for uh application

495
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,120
so

496
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,600
in general in the definitions

497
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,400
uh did you consider um

498
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,840
adding like the some multi

499
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,559
uh

500
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,440
maybe not

501
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,320
multi-dimensionality but

502
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,080
just as a point saying okay there are uh

503
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,400
different scopes

504
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,799
uh relative to which

505
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,160
we can provide a definition

506
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,200
uh yeah so

507
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,799
in the current draft we have a in the

508
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,880
introduction we are saying that uh some

509
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,400
of these terms have been used with

510
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,240
different meanings in different areas of

511
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,400
networking for example in routing and

512
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
and transport uh

513
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,039
folks might understand what a path is

514
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,840
differently and this document attempts

515
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,400
to provide a common definition to define

516
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,559
paths path elements and flows so we can

517
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,400
talk about them in penalty so the

518
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
document is not trying to

519
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,559
define it for everybody what they need

520
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,440
to

521
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,240
understand a path is but it's sort of

522
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,320
that the scope is uh discussions in

523
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,039
penalty and potentially uh drafts and

524
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,760
penalty that uh reference back to this

525
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,559
terminology draft um

526
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,919
and i think then the uh termina the uh

527
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,159
terminology or definitions themselves

528
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,200
are uh intended to be general enough

529
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,120
that basically an

530
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,200
um a node in a transport sense or a

531
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,880
routing sense they could both be nodes

532
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,520
right so there is sort of some some

533
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,919
flexibility here but the document

534
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,880
doesn't attempt to uh neatly define that

535
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,799
a node in a routing sense has to be this

536
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,640
and a node in the transport sense has to

537
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,799
be that

538
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,280
uh okay

539
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,440
so again um

540
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,000
so you don't think it would be uh

541
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
helpful for example for

542
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,960
each of maybe not all of them but for a

543
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,799
number of this definition

544
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,280
try to explicitly uh

545
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,679
gather uh

546
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,480
the the given context with respect to

547
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,280
which

548
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,919
you define uh

549
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,400
a thing for example if i get back to

550
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,840
that

551
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,000
example of endpoints

552
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,760
uh and for other uh just explicitly say

553
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,960
gather

554
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,080
see here here is here is what here are

555
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,400
the different contexts standardized or

556
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,360
not

557
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,480
with respect to which there exists

558
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,080
a stable definition of this uh

559
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,520
thing

560
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,000
right so the document doesn't define

561
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,159
endpoint right now but it does define

562
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,400
hosts

563
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,480
but i'm wondering if maybe it would make

564
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,320
sense to add an

565
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,240
endpoint definition and then basically

566
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,840
say it can mean these different kinds of

567
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,440
things but i would also be curious if

568
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,200
other people agree that that is useful

569
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,080
okay thanks

570
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,399
thank you

571
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,320
spencer

572
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,159
down to the down to the second bullet um

573
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,760
i guess one of the things i was thinking

574
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,360
about there was that um

575
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,640
two things uh

576
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,720
one is uh

577
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,120
what we did with the questions draft was

578
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,559
to say

579
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,400
these are the questions that we think

580
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,000
are research questions now

581
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,280
right so that was a checkpoint

582
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,720
and if if if those research questions

583
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,200
changed significantly uh we could

584
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,360
reasonably do that

585
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,880
rather than holding the document open to

586
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,080
see what other research questions pop up

587
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,440
so i don't i don't know if that's a

588
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,559
model that would make sense for the

589
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,240
um

590
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,960
you know for this draft or not but that

591
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,559
but if it did

592
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,559
that is what we you know that is what we

593
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,120
did with uh with the questions draft as

594
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,679
well uh uh research questions draft as

595
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,919
well

596
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:32,720
so

597
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,400
second thing is it seems to me that

598
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,520
it would be good for

599
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,159
and and this is orthogonal to what i

600
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,440
just said

601
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,679
um

602
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,039
terms that we ought to need

603
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,279
in pen rg

604
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,799
whether we have you know whether we have

605
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,120
a draft of that space or not

606
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,480
yet

607
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,799
i don't know how predictive

608
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,000
this draft could be about those terms

609
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,400
but i think that um

610
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,880
even if you well

611
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,039
circling back around even if you did

612
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,480
checkpoint this and say these are this

613
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,840
is the terminology that we're using

614
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,279
now uh

615
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,760
having a best draft open

616
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,080
for anything that we need to make you

617
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,039
know as as people come up with

618
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,400
things that we're looking at um

619
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,559
that we you know that the terminology

620
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,640
that we're not using now

621
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,080
so um

622
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,440
and the cool thing is that there are

623
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,600
people in line behind me who can explain

624
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,039
why i'm wrong um

625
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,080
thank you

626
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,440
go gauri

627
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,520
thank you for doing this

628
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,799
i do think we should define endpoints

629
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,440
so i will vote for that one

630
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,360
how are we going to

631
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,919
help you most to finish this document

632
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,679
are we going to try and raise some

633
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,679
issues and get help and discuss each

634
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,480
individual term a little bit or are we

635
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,720
going to do it by a mailing list or

636
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,240
we're going to just bash it a bit more

637
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,880
in our spare time this meeting how would

638
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,080
it best help you to to get what you need

639
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,440
i think github issues are great uh

640
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,760
i also welcome comments on the mailing

641
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,440
list but usually at some point i turn

642
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,400
them into github issues

643
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,960
and yeah i think um

644
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,120
right now i would be most curious if

645
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,480
people um

646
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,919
have any

647
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,320
suggestions for our existing definitions

648
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,840
because i kind of feel like at some

649
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,440
point i want to

650
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,200
decide that we're at least done with the

651
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,799
definitions that we already have and

652
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,559
then figure out if there is definitions

653
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,559
that we are missing and figure out if we

654
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,320
want to

655
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,919
checkpoint the draft and then circle

656
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,440
back at some point or whether we want to

657
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,720
keep it open

658
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,240
uh but

659
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,400
that's the kind of questions that i'm

660
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,480
that i'm asking myself and i guess if

661
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,159
you have a feedback on a specific

662
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,600
property

663
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,080
an issue is probably the best way to go

664
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,600
email is also fine and if you have

665
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,080
general thoughts on um

666
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,640
how to sort of determine which other

667
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,760
terms

668
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,840
we want to define maybe an email is best

669
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,440
because then we can all discuss it on a

670
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,840
penalty list

671
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,840
okay i mean um can i offer a couple more

672
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,320
just to see what happens an end to end

673
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,840
should be something we can define as a

674
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,039
transport people if we take sabine's and

675
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,799
put there and really be clear about

676
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,360
where we're defining its use

677
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,799
so some of these things are going to be

678
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,120
definable but only if we pin them down

679
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,158
is that helpful or not

680
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,840
i would say that if it helps us talk

681
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,039
about paths and uh be clear on what we

682
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:05,000
mean then yes

683
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,039
so calling myself from the queue

684
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,960
as an individual

685
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,760
i

686
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,000
uh

687
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,159
apologize for saying the e word and you

688
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,919
know throwing us down the uh sort of the

689
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,000
endpoint rabbit hole um

690
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,559
although i still think that it might be

691
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,600
useful to talk about sort of like

692
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,880
something that is that is a node

693
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,279
that is still considered to have like in

694
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,960
the whole transport space right like the

695
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
the the

696
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,399
there are certain privileges that we

697
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,760
give to endpoints and end-to-end

698
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,720
protocols and and usually we use crypto

699
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,320
to to enforce that right like so it

700
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,120
might be useful to say

701
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,200
to be able to say things about

702
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,279
path properties on the near side link

703
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,799
closest to an end point and then you

704
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,399
know it might be the definition of

705
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,799
endpoint is the end points are the point

706
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,240
at you know this into the path and this

707
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,320
end of the path and then it's like the

708
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
context you get for free

709
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,960
uh right like so depending on which path

710
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,399
you're talking about if the end point is

711
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,840
always the one at the the front end of

712
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,960
the path the back end of the path you

713
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,880
don't have to worry too much about is

714
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,640
that in point a tunnel ingress point or

715
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,120
an egress point or is that endpoint a

716
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,159
um

717
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,679
uh

718
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,480
uh is that endpoint a um

719
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,200
uh an end host or you know some sort of

720
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,399
proxy or whatever right um

721
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,480
i

722
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,000
i would tend to agree with sort of like

723
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,679
the i would tend to agree with that the

724
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,200
question that you uh a question that you

725
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,440
were asked earlier should be a statement

726
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,120
you know how do we know that these

727
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,880
definitions are

728
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,679
done i i think it might make sense to

729
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:46,720
have

730
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,600
especially on sort of like the big ones

731
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,080
entity node host link

732
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,960
path element and path

733
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,720
i think the

734
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,080
the other ones we can maybe talk about a

735
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,520
little bit more because they're defined

736
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,039
in terms of those

737
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,360
those we might want to say

738
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,480
hey

739
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,320
we're pretty sure as a research group

740
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,039
that this is how we want to say this

741
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,320
because i don't want to get to the point

742
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,760
where we you know go

743
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,600
all the way to the end of some of this

744
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,360
some of this traversal of the vocabulary

745
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,440
space and then say oh a path is actually

746
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,440
something subtly different in a way that

747
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,720
we need to go and do that again right

748
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,840
like so

749
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,279
there's a way to do a research group

750
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,440
last call on you know bullet points in a

751
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,360
subsection of a document

752
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,640
um

753
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,799
but

754
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,320
maybe we should have that discussion on

755
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,039
the list it's like let's please throw i

756
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,640
think between now and the next meeting

757
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,480
definitely okay let me put my chair hat

758
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,480
on between now and the next and next

759
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,320
meeting definitely

760
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,120
the

761
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,919
please throw as many arrows as you can

762
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,000
at the terminology in this document up

763
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,360
to path

764
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,679
like if you have something there that

765
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,840
that that makes you unhappy other than

766
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,760
the fact that it is necessarily like

767
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,840
path is kind of a very long paragraph

768
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,279
and i don't know how you can shorten it

769
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,279
but in terms of things that are missing

770
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,240
please make those suggestions

771
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,720
let's say before the next meeting um

772
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,360
and then we can at least say okay well

773
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,120
now the people who've been here and and

774
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,360
building this document over the past

775
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,559
um

776
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,760
more than a year

777
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,080
uh or the pat this definition in its

778
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,919
current form for you know the past

779
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,240
couple of meeting cycles

780
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,159
there's at least consensus among us that

781
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,679
this is probably not wrong

782
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,840
spencer

783
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,760
uh i just i just uh pasted something in

784
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,039
the the queue but uh

785
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,520
if if

786
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,919
if we're kind of headed down the get

787
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,240
hole

788
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,720
spiral uh for in penargy uh which has

789
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,480
been helpful for me

790
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,519
uh as a as a draft author

791
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,559
um

792
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,640
one of the things that uh

793
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,919
groups like oh let's say quick do which

794
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,120
have a fairly active github repo

795
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,519
is publish weekly summaries of uh issues

796
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,600
and comments and

797
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,480
uh prs and what got merged and things

798
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,600
like that

799
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,919
uh if if any activity happened in the uh

800
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,519
in the github repos that are being

801
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,399
tracked

802
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,799
i put a link to the uh

803
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,799
to the uh

804
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,279
github repo uh where

805
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,519
uh those report those report activity

806
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,159
reports are maintained

807
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,200
and

808
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,559
i found them to be very helpful in

809
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,640
the seller working group i'm i'm

810
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,000
chairing

811
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,320
which has an awful lot of stuff going on

812
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,240
in github and

813
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,159
much less stuff happening on the mailing

814
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,039
list

815
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,600
so uh if it would make people feel

816
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,039
better about

817
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,360
having conversations in

818
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,918
github

819
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,120
there is a fairly easy way to give at

820
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,720
least a high level

821
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,279
indication that there are things in the

822
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,679
github repo that people should take a

823
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,120
look at

824
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,880
uh i will

825
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,480
i should mention that

826
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,600
i i will go ahead and send that pr to to

827
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,640
and not

828
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,919
during this meeting uh it's a very easy

829
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,480
thing to do yeah yeah like at the very

830
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,720
worst it's like one more one more email

831
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,799
in the inbox per week that things happen

832
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,080
on these drafts

833
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,480
uh for pan rg i i think that's like

834
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,080
something that we as the research group

835
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,279
should provide as a service to their

836
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,480
office authors and i'm just gonna do it

837
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,320
fabulous thank you

838
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,000
all right i think the queue is drained

839
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,159
but we have a whole bunch of times so

840
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,799
i'm gonna leave this open for another

841
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,000
five to ten seconds or so

842
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
see if anybody

843
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,480
thank you this was already useful

844
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,600
very useful

845
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,279
and thank you very much for the for the

846
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,000
the last um update i um

847
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,799
i like where this document is going

848
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,039
true

849
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,159
all right uh uncomfortable silence over

850
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,159
um thank you very much rhys uh

851
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,720
next up

852
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,039
is nikola

853
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,000
take it away

854
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,360
hello everyone can you hear me

855
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,880
we can

856
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,760
great

857
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,600
um

858
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,960
so

859
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,960
thank you for giving us the opportunity

860
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,039
to present this document um

861
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,039
we have been working on that for a while

862
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,840
and a lot of you may have already heard

863
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,279
of this document

864
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,240
i think

865
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
that

866
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,559
for the discussion we just add uh the

867
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,280
main and different and the main uh thing

868
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,079
that we have done since the last etf is

869
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,520
trying to use

870
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,839
the past properties document uh to

871
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,918
describe satellite systems so we tried

872
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,800
to use the terms of host node

873
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,159
and the different path properties to

874
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,800
describe our systems

875
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,480
so this is a talk i do on the behalf of

876
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,520
my courses i have a few because very

877
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,839
small lego slides so

878
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,440
i guess that if you want to interrupt me

879
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,200
at any moment please go ahead

880
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,719
so we have already

881
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,760
shown these slides a lot but basically

882
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,320
there were a lot of activity in the atf

883
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,399
that concluded in the 2000

884
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,000
when basically

885
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,839
tcp features

886
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,000
required specific turning for

887
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,480
geo satellite deployment

888
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,359
but that was more than 20 years ago

889
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,160
tcp is much more sophisticated now we

890
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,680
have

891
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,119
bbr that does great on saturday systems

892
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,480
and cubic have changed a lot too

893
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,079
but also

894
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,760
even though

895
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,160
tcp has increased and improved a lot we

896
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,680
still use

897
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,320
performance sensing proxies more for

898
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,720
isolating the losses for example and do

899
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,720
some specific tuning on tcp

900
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,880
we have an issue at the moment that with

901
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,880
quick deployment uh

902
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
things are not

903
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,119
that great depends on the applications

904
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,119
you're looking at in some cases it will

905
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,520
quick helps a lot sometimes

906
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,440
when you have long flows transfers with

907
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,640
losses it's not that great

908
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,680
and

909
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,800
also

910
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,000
what happened

911
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,160
since the 2000 that

912
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,079
geo satellites

913
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,480
have seen their capacity increasing a

914
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,680
lot

915
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,200
in 2010

916
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,960
satellite

917
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,400
satellite could

918
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,160
transmit 100 gigabytes and now we are we

919
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,800
are launching satellites that have 500

920
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,200
gigabytes capacity

921
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,160
we have also all heard about the leo

922
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,240
boom that is going on at the moment with

923
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,320
starting getting deployed

924
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,000
so there are a lot of

925
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,359
strange and

926
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,359
a huge variety of satcom systems that

927
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,280
are being deployed and we think it's

928
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,800
very important to

929
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,040
describe them more in a document at the

930
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,520
atf

931
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,160
in short on this slide we try to compare

932
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,960
geo and leo systems

933
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,440
if we focus only on the satellite access

934
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,640
network

935
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,598
now we have a

936
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,800
very high and variable data rate on the

937
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,280
geosystems the latency is high

938
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,200
we try to improve the speed of light

939
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,119
every day but we

940
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,760
are we struggle in doing so

941
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,200
there is no losses and um basically

942
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,440
the leo satellites has

943
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,119
um on overhaul

944
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,599
a lower uh

945
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,760
data rate but it depends a lot on the

946
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,680
amount of leo satellites that you are

947
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,680
launching and

948
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,160
basically the latency is way lower than

949
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,280
the one we have in geosystems

950
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,400
again

951
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,160
we all in this document have a very geo

952
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,520
background

953
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,839
and we would be very happy to

954
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,520
have some feedbacks and experience from

955
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,680
users and operators that are more

956
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,119
familiar with

957
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,079
leo systems

958
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,920
leo systems are very strange and very

959
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,400
different from one one from another and

960
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,359
um

961
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,359
what starlink is doing is different from

962
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,320
what one web is doing and what td site

963
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,160
is planning on doing and we think it's

964
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,960
very interesting to everyone to have

965
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,800
some sort of document described being

966
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,680
all that

967
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,359
in the atf

968
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,759
because

969
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,800
it helps if the transport is at

970
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,400
satellite aware

971
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,079
because satellite system used to

972
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,960
broadcast tv only and now we see

973
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,800
that the satellite can be

974
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,359
just one part of the end-to-end internet

975
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,720
pass

976
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,320
because this is used a lot for back

977
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,599
calling

978
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,839
for

979
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,880
basically trunking

980
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,839
and

981
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,640
for lots of users that have been remote

982
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,839
working for a while and some of us

983
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,560
are using satellites to do so sometimes

984
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,720
we use satellite we don't even know

985
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,119
so uh satellites are part of the

986
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,200
end-to-end uh system

987
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,000
so

988
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,160
the main change as i said from

989
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,720
the document it's just something that we

990
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,040
have started it's not over it's not

991
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,240
finished and basically we tried to look

992
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,839
at the generic satellite system saying

993
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,760
you have the host that has the end

994
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,200
service then we have lots of nodes and

995
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,119
also at the end

996
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,240
the node

997
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,040
b

998
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,800
is the point of presence of the satcom

999
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,359
system then we have the satellite uh

1000
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,480
lots of uh

1001
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,400
network functions where we have our

1002
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,359
proxies and firewall then we have

1003
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,119
something that is more really

1004
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,280
specific to satellites focusing on mac

1005
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,839
and physical layer functionalities then

1006
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,480
we have one or several satellites and we

1007
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,400
have a node that receives a signal and

1008
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,079
then we have the error service so this

1009
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,200
is a

1010
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,760
we tried to use

1011
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,839
the past properties document to describe

1012
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,400
generic satcom systems and

1013
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
we have seen that basically there are

1014
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,760
some parts that would be interesting to

1015
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,599
discuss because

1016
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,400
what

1017
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,160
would be very interesting for us is to

1018
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,119
see

1019
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,599
for the terrestrial part what are the

1020
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,599
protocol features that are available

1021
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,599
what transport protocols are available

1022
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,520
what can we do and what is the

1023
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,960
transparency of the the path and then

1024
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,720
for something that is more satellite

1025
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,440
centric we have all these elements that

1026
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,040
we think is interesting to describe

1027
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,320
so

1028
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,240
lots of them are related to the quality

1029
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,599
of the signal

1030
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,760
and

1031
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,680
so

1032
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,040
basically

1033
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,880
we have done that for

1034
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,079
one

1035
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,520
geosystem

1036
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,480
and

1037
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,520
we think that our next we have different

1038
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,760
solutions for the next step uh in

1039
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,960
general pass awareness helps a lot

1040
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,960
using this document the patent pass the

1041
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,280
penalty and password terminology has

1042
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,880
helped us in trying to

1043
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,839
try to

1044
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,319
better describe our strange systems

1045
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,160
because we are not that's

1046
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,000
so strange and we want to show that to

1047
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
everyone

1048
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,079
awareness of the characteristics of our

1049
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,160
systems would help

1050
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,160
protocol designers and

1051
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,880
maybe help also all of us to take better

1052
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,119
decisions on how to design protocols for

1053
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,319
this use case

1054
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,440
basically

1055
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,520
we know that we have just started it to

1056
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,880
use the terminal

1057
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,440
terminology in all the document uh this

1058
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,640
is has just

1059
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,720
just been done as an example at the

1060
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,240
beginning of this document

1061
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,319
but we wanted to have uh

1062
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,800
a feedback on the group on that saying

1063
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
it is interesting to do that is it

1064
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,960
interesting to have this some sort of

1065
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,560
example on how you use the past

1066
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,640
properties document does it make sense

1067
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,480
to have that as a document as a research

1068
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,960
group so these are the questions we have

1069
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,160
and

1070
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,400
i would be happy to have

1071
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,240
questions and

1072
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,279
and your feedback on this

1073
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
thank you very much we already have

1074
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,200
reason the kyries

1075
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,119
yeah uh i read your update on a draft

1076
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,880
and i also read the original draft

1077
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,040
before um and i i thought it was really

1078
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,800
interesting uh to see uh the

1079
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,640
vocabulary of path properties uh

1080
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,119
terminology used in this draft uh i

1081
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,839
think it's useful at least uh

1082
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,760
as a sort of a check of how well this

1083
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,839
terminology works uh to be used in other

1084
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,480
documents which i hope to see more of

1085
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,240
i have a couple of

1086
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,760
questions or feedback points that i'm

1087
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,920
going to send via email because they're

1088
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,520
sort of going into detail a little too

1089
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,880
much um

1090
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,839
but regarding this document i think it

1091
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,480
would be really interesting to

1092
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,440
maybe attempt to answer some of our

1093
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,359
panorgy research questions i'm just

1094
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,359
looking at the questions documented

1095
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,000
we're about to publish and it has a

1096
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,480
questions on discovering distributing

1097
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,480
and trustworthiness of path properties

1098
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,800
for example and i was wondering if we

1099
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,760
could

1100
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,440
at least sort of map out the problem

1101
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,400
space

1102
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,640
for satellite systems specifically and

1103
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,359
maybe take a step at sort of have any of

1104
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,599
those questions being solved in this

1105
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,760
satellite context or are we on track to

1106
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,240
solve them in this context and then also

1107
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,640
maybe for supporting path selection

1108
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,079
there's a couple of

1109
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,040
um

1110
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,040
questions in our questions draft and i

1111
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,040
don't think that we are going to write

1112
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,839
like one document that answers the uh

1113
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,560
trustworthiness and discovering path

1114
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,040
properties for every context but this is

1115
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,000
one

1116
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,480
context in which maybe we can at least

1117
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,839
get a little further on those questions

1118
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,160
so i'm actually imagining maybe having

1119
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,240
this document and maybe other documents

1120
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,160
answering part of our research questions

1121
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,760
for their specific

1122
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,560
terminology technology and and use case

1123
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,920
and i think in that context it could be

1124
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,680
really useful to panorji but i haven't

1125
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,640
seen any explicit answers to those uh

1126
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,160
penalty research questions in the

1127
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,920
document i think it might be a useful

1128
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,240
addition

1129
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,440
thank you very much for your feedback we

1130
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,280
i think this is something i need to

1131
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,280
check with my courses

1132
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,480
but we

1133
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,800
have a very transport oriented document

1134
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,760
at the moment and

1135
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,960
we

1136
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,480
we think that this can be changed and

1137
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,240
indeed having a more

1138
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,079
using the terminology of prodigy was

1139
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,720
just the first step of

1140
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,960
discussing these

1141
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,880
research questions

1142
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,160
the questions we are treating at the

1143
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,520
moment are very transport centric and i

1144
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,640
think that if it is

1145
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,440
not only editorial but trying to provide

1146
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,200
answers to the what is discussed the

1147
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,599
research questions in the document and

1148
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,680
how uh the patented questions applies to

1149
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,560
satcom systems i think uh seeing an

1150
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,480
interesting exercise to do

1151
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,079
so i have to check with my coasters but

1152
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,480
i guess some of them are here but i

1153
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,880
guess this is something we can truly do

1154
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,000
and

1155
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,680
if this is of interest for the group i

1156
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,839
mean

1157
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,359
so um

1158
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:38,640
chair hat on uh

1159
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,440
i i i agree with with everything that re

1160
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,040
said um i think

1161
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,640
so there's a question to me with respect

1162
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,040
to this document versus like another

1163
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,960
sort of like wider ranging document of

1164
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,480
looking at

1165
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,640
where we are with respect to the context

1166
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,040
of satellite communications and and path

1167
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,040
awareness because i think that that with

1168
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,480
satellite communications path awareness

1169
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,520
is one of the places where you get the

1170
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,839
biggest win right like so just you know

1171
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,599
you're on a satellite path lets you do

1172
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,920
so much to make it tolerable

1173
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,839
um

1174
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,200
the

1175
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,280
i'm wondering whether and i don't have

1176
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,720
an opinion here

1177
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,079
um

1178
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,200
whether like that deeper exploration of

1179
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,480
where we are the questions is a

1180
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,240
different document than this document

1181
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,720
which is very focused on sort of like

1182
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,240
the specifics of transport i noticed

1183
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,319
that this document right now has

1184
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,400
a tsvwg

1185
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,520
um label on it uh is it up for adoption

1186
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,319
in tsvwg or was it just like that was

1187
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:39,759
sort of like the first place to send it

1188
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,920
um that is where we discussed it at some

1189
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,599
point so this is why we have we why we

1190
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,599
we first placed it that's the first

1191
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,119
place we send it

1192
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,240
uh and

1193
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,520
[Music]

1194
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,000
as i said uh i think the

1195
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,400
i am

1196
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,560
i think that if we end up

1197
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,000
using the patented terminology to

1198
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,520
describe satcom systems we think it's

1199
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,920
something useful for the community and

1200
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,920
maybe all the transport specific

1201
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,319
discussions can be

1202
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,160
taken out of the document yeah

1203
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,480
the thing is there's lots of work needed

1204
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,960
to make it more penalty-like

1205
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,920
because uh not only describes all the

1206
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,040
systems using the productivity

1207
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,280
terminology but also as assess the

1208
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,760
research questions as teresa mentioned

1209
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,960
which we are not doing at all at the

1210
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,560
moment and

1211
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,680
this is

1212
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,240
i think lots of the document that has a

1213
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,359
lot of

1214
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,160
editorial work needed in it and so

1215
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,920
that's why we also wanted to have your

1216
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,079
feedback on if this is interesting we

1217
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,040
can surely work on something more energy

1218
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,440
for the next ietf that's what's our main

1219
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,119
discussion point at the moment

1220
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,960
so so as an individual contributor

1221
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,920
because i don't want to bias the

1222
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,920
conversation you know from the chair as

1223
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,119
an individual contributor i would be

1224
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,040
very interested in seeing that uh there

1225
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,440
was a comment in the chat earlier where

1226
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,520
med had pointed out that seeing a

1227
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,880
a um

1228
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,800
architecture draft in this space would

1229
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,560
be super useful and i i kind of like

1230
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,839
suggested yeah like it would be neat if

1231
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,440
we like looked at scion in this way and

1232
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,680
did like a five pager on scion to say

1233
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,880
here are the questions here the answers

1234
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,720
that simon has i think that the

1235
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,319
satellite thing

1236
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:19,599
is

1237
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:20,559
um

1238
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,079
i don't say more interesting but it's

1239
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,040
super interesting in that a it is a

1240
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,359
uh a an evolutionary architecture as

1241
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:28,720
opposed to a revolutionary architecture

1242
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,000
it's like here's how we're bending the

1243
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,920
internet to fit into this this

1244
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,599
technological space and i think it would

1245
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,680
be super useful to see that like i would

1246
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,280
i would i would read that draft twice

1247
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,040
thank you great

1248
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,440
so i guess we have a lot of work ahead

1249
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,040
and and um

1250
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,520
we will work on and

1251
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,359
the data invasion of the document to

1252
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,400
have something more energy and

1253
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,640
try to

1254
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,240
answer the questions at least discuss

1255
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,839
answers to the questions not only i'm

1256
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,680
not sure we have the answers but please

1257
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,359
try to provide them

1258
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:05,720
i i see we have gory in queue

1259
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,240
yeah do you want gauri with his heart on

1260
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,599
my heart

1261
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,200
or with that

1262
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,880
girl with that please

1263
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,440
i like cats yes

1264
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,920
this document is too complicated to make

1265
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,960
progress in tsvwg recently

1266
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,319
um

1267
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:29,280
it tried to um address some

1268
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,880
um need for an update but really

1269
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,720
there's two parts one is defining what a

1270
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,119
satellite system is and how it is a path

1271
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,720
through the internet and the other one

1272
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,520
is how you fix transport

1273
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,599
so i think this needs to be

1274
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,400
decimated into two documents at least

1275
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,599
and

1276
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,319
without a hat

1277
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,880
i would love um to try and bring the pun

1278
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,880
rg bit here because i think it's more

1279
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,200
useful to define what a satellite system

1280
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,240
is and

1281
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,079
what properties it might have and what

1282
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,079
challenges it might have in a research

1283
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,640
context that it is to try and take it as

1284
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,599
an itf standards document so

1285
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,760
as an individual i would happily destroy

1286
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,119
my own document and and bring the best

1287
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,640
part of it here

1288
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,720
and then see if the the other half could

1289
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,240
be sorted later

1290
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,839
does that help brian

1291
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:20,640
yes

1292
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,680
uh

1293
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,960
okay i would then say just from the

1294
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,880
chair please do that right like so you

1295
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,640
know we've had you know at least

1296
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,240
at least two individuals one of them is

1297
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,599
myself but okay i express interest in in

1298
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,319
uh in having that document exists so

1299
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,000
so please do it and we'll go ahead and

1300
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,680
save you some save your spot on the

1301
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,680
agenda next time

1302
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,919
thank you

1303
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,760
all right

1304
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,040
thank you very much next up we have

1305
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,680
i

1306
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,760
closed my agenda to go read the thing we

1307
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,480
have spencer of course we have spencer

1308
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,000
spencer talking about multi-pass

1309
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,280
selection strategy is coming up

1310
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,760
uh do you do i use your slides or do i

1311
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,599
use mine or

1312
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,240
i think you can

1313
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,200
you can you can uh

1314
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,160
try to use uploaded slides if you prefer

1315
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,119
yeah there are like three pre

1316
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:32,240
pre-selected or pre-uploaded slides

1317
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,680
share pre-loaded slide next to joining

1318
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,839
the queue

1319
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,440
because

1320
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,359
so i'm asking to share slides and ask

1321
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,040
you to share a screen

1322
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,400
no no next year

1323
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,760
next to share screen there's share

1324
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,760
preloaded slides

1325
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,040
uh i don't have that yet so

1326
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:55,839
uh

1327
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:59,599
find uh join the queue button and right

1328
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:00,559
now

1329
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,559
then what i can find yes then there's a

1330
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,400
field there's a there's a there's an

1331
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,880
icon of a file

1332
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,880
uh i gotta ask to share slides

1333
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,359
yeah ask us your slides that one yes

1334
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,359
okay cool

1335
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,359
okay fabulous

1336
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:20,480
so and oh okay and i'm

1337
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,800
doing the um

1338
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,160
pet selection yeah okay cool yeah

1339
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,920
uh thank you and thank you for thank you

1340
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,319
for the uh thank you for the opportunity

1341
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:37,839
to learn how to do this

1342
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,839
so uh

1343
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,559
this is kind of an update on where i

1344
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,040
think i am with past selection

1345
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,440
strategies and i hope it's

1346
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,319
uh helpful for

1347
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:53,680
the

1348
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,440
research group to to be thinking about

1349
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,680
not only this topic but the kinds of

1350
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,680
things that

1351
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,359
the research group

1352
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,000
can be doing usefully

1353
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,599
um

1354
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,520
the um

1355
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,800
let's see and so

1356
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,760
and i just oh okay cool like i said i'm

1357
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,200
still finding buttons my apologies um

1358
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,919
so um

1359
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,000
yeah

1360
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,920
so i the first thing i wanted to talk

1361
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,640
about is where we are on if you don't

1362
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,640
have multipath or using a transport

1363
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,800
protocol

1364
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,160
this was a really interesting

1365
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,000
conversation

1366
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,520
that

1367
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,920
i had some inkling was going to happen

1368
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,720
but

1369
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,960
it did happen definitely in

1370
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,960
tsv area yesterday

1371
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,000
uh which was martin duke pointing out

1372
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,839
that uh

1373
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,960
multipath is everywhere and and that's

1374
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,119
kind of that that's kind of his quote

1375
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,240
not mine

1376
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,359
uh

1377
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,680
yo and like is this taking over the

1378
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,480
internet the ietf transport area

1379
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,240
uh well it's at least taking over

1380
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,760
transport area

1381
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,119
uh

1382
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,000
recognizing that we have had

1383
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,359
multi-path

1384
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:12,880
things like

1385
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,800
uh

1386
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:20,079
failover in sctp since the early 2000s

1387
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:21,280
um

1388
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,079
i apologize on behalf of my dogs

1389
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,319
um but uh

1390
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,079
even you know with them even

1391
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,839
experimenting with load sharing and

1392
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,839
starting in 2010

1393
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,640
and we've had to multipath tcp as an

1394
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,240
experimental rfc since 2013.

1395
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:43,280
but tsvwg adopted multi-path dccp at the

1396
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,720
last itf

1397
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,599
and a quick working group hummed to

1398
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,760
adopt multi-path

1399
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,079
quick extensions yesterday they're good

1400
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,920
they'll check that on the list of course

1401
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,680
but

1402
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,440
that's what we do

1403
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,680
so my picture of

1404
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,960
godzilla

1405
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,000
is uh

1406
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,640
kind of reflecting uh that

1407
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,960
in my opinion this is becoming more

1408
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,960
common

1409
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,680
that is becoming more deployable

1410
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,480
and that is becoming more ambitious i'll

1411
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,240
talk about those things a little bit

1412
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,000
later in the uh

1413
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,559
in the in the talk

1414
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,800
i want so

1415
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,000
we did this thing on uh impediments to

1416
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,240
deployment for path aware networking

1417
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,839
technologies

1418
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,599
and uh because the multi-path extension

1419
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,040
for quick draft was just

1420
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:43,760
i

1421
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,960
was just hummed for adoption and quick i

1422
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,119
thought it would be interesting to go

1423
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,839
through

1424
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:54,480
uh maybe a little you know

1425
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,799
summary of my thoughts on that

1426
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:59,200
um

1427
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,920
i want to emphasize that the draft

1428
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,040
authors which i am not one of are the

1429
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,960
experts

1430
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,119
this is the intersection of three

1431
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,440
individual drafts i've read all three of

1432
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,680
the individual drafts and i've read this

1433
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,640
one

1434
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,079
and participated in some of the

1435
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,680
discussions

1436
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,280
that they had but

1437
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,280
so far i believe there is one word in

1438
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,480
the draft that i have uh contributed

1439
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,799
um

1440
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,319
so

1441
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,640
let me say what they were presenting and

1442
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,760
in the life and the the

1443
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,119
the uh

1444
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,960
links in this uh the proceedings should

1445
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,119
be live for people's

1446
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,640
uh convenience

1447
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,440
uh

1448
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,599
they were focusing on core components

1449
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,960
like negotiation and path management

1450
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,040
and basic scheduling

1451
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,280
and uh packet transmission and

1452
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,200
re-transmission

1453
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,280
okay that's that's kind of their that's

1454
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,640
kind of their scope uh scoping there

1455
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,280
and their design principles

1456
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,720
were to

1457
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,559
use as much as they as possible from the

1458
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,680
core quick specification

1459
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,400
they are defining a path as a

1460
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,799
bi-directional for tuple

1461
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:17,440
they are signaling

1462
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,280
um

1463
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,160
sorry

1464
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,599
uh they're they're replacing uh path

1465
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:27,040
migration by past simultaneous use

1466
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,880
and this is actually

1467
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,799
sort of where

1468
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,480
the

1469
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,160
current discussion

1470
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,200
or the current draft for sctp is where

1471
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,000
they had the ability to do failover in

1472
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,359
sctp

1473
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,119
and now they're saying well if we have

1474
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,599
these two perfectly good paths we could

1475
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,240
use both of them at the same time

1476
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,320
so

1477
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,400
[Music]

1478
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,960
kind of you know kind of the same thing

1479
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,280
going on here

1480
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,079
they added one transport parameter to

1481
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,880
say basically

1482
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,839
enable multipath they added

1483
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:07,119
two new frames one is

1484
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,599
frame abandon because

1485
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:14,000
the way path migration worked

1486
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,559
they were moving from one active path to

1487
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,400
another active path

1488
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,799
and they said basically you know that

1489
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,960
the thinking was that they could

1490
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,319
basically

1491
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:25,599
clean up

1492
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:28,799
the path that you move away from

1493
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:31,920
which is what you want to do

1494
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,960
for failover kind of things is it's what

1495
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,559
you don't want to do if you want to do

1496
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,799
anything besides failover um

1497
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:43,200
they have

1498
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,480
one remaining decision

1499
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,040
whether they use one

1500
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,680
packet number space or multiple packet

1501
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,880
numbers

1502
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,680
spaces and that's

1503
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,160
uh explained in the decision

1504
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,160
and that's explained in the draft and

1505
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,760
basically

1506
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,799
that was not a show stopper for adoption

1507
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,880
uh they don't want to publish it with

1508
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,960
that option with that being optional

1509
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:13,920
so

1510
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,880
remember the lessons learned that we

1511
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,680
have that we put in the uh

1512
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,839
penargy

1513
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:23,680
uh documented on impediments to

1514
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,920
employment uh there's there's a chart in

1515
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,680
there that looks like this i think it's

1516
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,119
a table one

1517
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,200
if i'm remembering yeah table one if i

1518
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,640
remember correctly

1519
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,599
uh

1520
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,880
so i went through that a little bit

1521
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,480
and um

1522
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,079
people can interrupt me and uh

1523
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:45,280
ask questions or even tell me i'm wrong

1524
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,400
but

1525
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,119
this is where i am on this

1526
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:51,920
uh and

1527
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,760
it would be okay with me if other people

1528
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,240
had opinions about this

1529
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,400
that especially because they're relevant

1530
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,440
to

1531
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,480
active

1532
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,920
draft in the quick working group

1533
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,240
the first thing was how do you justify a

1534
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,160
deployment

1535
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,880
that is something to think about

1536
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,760
because in spencer's opinion

1537
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,839
that depends on your path selection

1538
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:18,640
strategy uh

1539
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,599
it's pretty easy to justify

1540
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,520
deployment

1541
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,400
if you're going to be doing uh

1542
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,680
loan balancing across multiple paths for

1543
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,119
for like a

1544
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:32,799
bandwidth bonding

1545
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:34,720
path bonding kind of thing or something

1546
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,040
like that

1547
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,000
there are path selection strategies that

1548
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,920
you don't get

1549
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,079
as much obvious

1550
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:47,040
help from uh at least not yet

1551
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,160
uh

1552
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,559
but we'll talk about that

1553
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,000
in a little bit

1554
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,119
um

1555
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,640
the

1556
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,119
benefit for early adopters

1557
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,960
so basically you say you know if if your

1558
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,040
past election strategy

1559
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,440
would give you benefits

1560
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,000
you have

1561
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,839
you don't have to wait for

1562
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:13,440
other people to adopt it

1563
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,440
is entirely up to the

1564
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,799
uh input the endpoints uh and the

1565
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,319
endpoints can

1566
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:22,799
uh you know the endpoints can use this

1567
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,440
and if e if one endpoint doesn't support

1568
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,839
it they'll use

1569
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:28,400
uh

1570
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,599
quick

1571
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:32,240
rfc 9000 version

1572
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,558
um

1573
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,760
benefits during partial deployment

1574
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,760
and and this actually this is actually

1575
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,040
the network

1576
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,559
side of the or sorry the path side

1577
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,520
of the previous one which is

1578
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,680
that's basically saying do i have to

1579
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,960
upgrade everything along the path

1580
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,480
in order

1581
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,599
for

1582
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,440
you to get benefits

1583
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,680
and as we said there's nothing there's

1584
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,520
nothing that's involved here except the

1585
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,960
end points

1586
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,000
so that's you know not a problem

1587
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,520
the

1588
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,760
the question of whether you

1589
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,520
can outperform end-to-end protocols

1590
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,720
um

1591
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,400
this you know these are the signals used

1592
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,400
by quick so including multi-path quick

1593
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,440
uh

1594
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,280
are end-to-end uh we did say uh and this

1595
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,040
we talked about this during the quick

1596
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,079
session

1597
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,240
you might have the opportunity to do

1598
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,160
better than end-to-end

1599
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,440
if you have a good strategy for

1600
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,160
which path you use for x

1601
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,079
and you know this is this is you know

1602
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:43,280
one of the things that comes up in

1603
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,480
satellite

1604
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,680
um so it's possible for you to beat

1605
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,160
uh it's possible for you to beat end to

1606
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,240
end on one path but

1607
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,599
it seems like you're not going to get

1608
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:57,359
worse

1609
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:00,160
most of the time

1610
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,160
one of the big one of the biggest

1611
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,599
obstacles that we talked about in rc for

1612
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,280
9049

1613
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,839
was the tension between

1614
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:13,599
operators having to

1615
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,319
upgrade to or somehow

1616
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,480
to be actively involved in deploying a

1617
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,839
new network

1618
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:23,440
a new path aware technology

1619
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,480
but they would want to pay for that

1620
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,240
and you know so like you know you're

1621
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,799
really balancing the

1622
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:33,520
benefits and the costs

1623
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,480
to operators and to end users

1624
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,359
that's not really relevant here because

1625
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,240
the um

1626
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,359
the the extensions are

1627
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:47,440
to that are encrypted they're not part

1628
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,400
of the invariant uh

1629
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,440
header so

1630
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,839
which is you know which is public so

1631
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:58,640
basically the you know the operator's

1632
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,680
decision

1633
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,599
the operator should the is not

1634
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:03,599
participating in this at all

1635
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,680
so that concern

1636
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,598
that impediment doesn't seem to apply

1637
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:15,440
the impact on operational practices

1638
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,119
and this is actually kind of interesting

1639
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:18,720
because i think in

1640
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,440
9049 we were mostly thinking about

1641
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,400
operational practices within the network

1642
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,839
but now that we're talking about a

1643
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:29,039
protocol that is

1644
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:30,240
but now that we're talking about a

1645
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,319
protocol that is

1646
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:33,440
um

1647
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,280
encrypted end-to-end or heavily

1648
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,480
encrypted end-to-end uh

1649
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,720
those are not the operational practices

1650
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,280
that may be involved uh

1651
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,720
we said you know it is possible that uh

1652
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,200
if you're using q log now

1653
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,280
um

1654
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,359
at

1655
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:55,760
in operations at an endpoint

1656
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,799
uh you may have to you may you know need

1657
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,839
to enhance key log and you may need to

1658
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:04,640
change your operational practices to say

1659
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,799
what you look at when you're when you're

1660
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:09,359
trying to understand uh what's happening

1661
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:11,680
with a uh with a connection

1662
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,160
but let me say i i think that's minimal

1663
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:14,960
uh

1664
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,680
it's certainly not the obstacle that we

1665
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,119
were thinking of it when we did 9049.

1666
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:22,319
um

1667
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:25,359
the impact on uh our per connection

1668
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,920
state uh all the all the connection

1669
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,960
status in the endpoints so again this is

1670
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:31,760
not

1671
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,920
uh per connection state for things in

1672
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,599
the l and the network

1673
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,359
um

1674
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:39,280
so this you know so this is this is not

1675
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,720
a change

1676
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,240
i can

1677
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:46,079
stop here or go to the next slide if

1678
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:48,079
people have clarifying questions on this

1679
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:50,319
one

1680
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,880
and i should probably be watching the

1681
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,640
queue i think there's a bunch of

1682
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,839
clarifying

1683
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:59,440
question slash discussion in the chat

1684
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,960
uh if you want to bring in

1685
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,400
mike

1686
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,640
um

1687
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:05,920
awesome

1688
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,520
i will let people come to the queue or

1689
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,640
we can keep that in chat yeah

1690
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,119
i think it's yeah it might be clarifying

1691
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:14,559
discussion as opposed to clarifying

1692
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:16,960
questions let's keep going

1693
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:17,760
okay

1694
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,280
comes out of that

1695
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:23,440
cool uh and i am thinking about a kind

1696
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,640
of fun thing

1697
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,799
uh just glancing at those but let's go

1698
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:28,799
let's let's do the next slide

1699
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,559
um

1700
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,559
so

1701
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:36,319
keeping traffic on pa fast paths at as

1702
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:38,799
as a you know as the traffic goes

1703
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:42,160
through it's along the path uh we're not

1704
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,799
doing any impact on any ip header or

1705
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:47,359
extension ip header field

1706
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:50,160
so uh no reason to drop off the fast

1707
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,119
pass

1708
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,640
uh that i can that i can see

1709
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,160
the uh

1710
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,880
endpoints trusting midpoints and

1711
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,680
midpoints trusting endpoints um

1712
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,880
there's you know

1713
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:05,839
these

1714
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:07,680
editions are encrypted they're not you

1715
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,079
know they're not in invariant fields at

1716
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:11,039
all so

1717
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,720
none of the none of the signaling is

1718
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,000
coming from

1719
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,599
or going to

1720
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:18,880
uh midpoints so there's no

1721
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,640
particular reason for um

1722
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,160
trust to be you know trust to be a

1723
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,400
concern at all

1724
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,000
reacting to distance signals uh this

1725
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,839
when we did nine zero four nine

1726
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,319
uh support for

1727
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:38,640
reacting to distance signals was a lot

1728
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,359
about how quickly network

1729
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:43,039
elements

1730
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:44,559
intermediaries

1731
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:47,440
could detect something that the

1732
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,559
uh

1733
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:49,760
that the

1734
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,319
let's say a sender needed to know

1735
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:53,200
uh

1736
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,720
and

1737
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,640
our you know our understanding is

1738
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,160
basically

1739
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,480
by the you know by the time the

1740
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,280
intermediary could react

1741
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,640
uh

1742
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,079
the

1743
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:08,480
indian signaling is already

1744
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,319
headed the right direction

1745
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:12,640
uh so i don't think i don't think that

1746
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,640
that's you know i don't think that's an

1747
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,319
obstacle at all

1748
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:19,359
uh there's two things that i

1749
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:21,920
on this slide that i thought were worth

1750
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,359
thinking about

1751
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:24,640
um

1752
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:29,039
one was support in endpoint stacks

1753
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,920
so these are potential user space stacks

1754
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:32,360
and

1755
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,400
[Music]

1756
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,760
that's

1757
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,319
ought to be that ought to be a lot less

1758
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:41,280
of a concern than support in endpoint

1759
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,680
stacks has been for

1760
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,200
path aware networking technique

1761
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,640
deployment in the past

1762
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,119
recognizing that

1763
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:53,440
scheduling for this is a work in

1764
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,359
progress

1765
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:58,240
and the slides that were presented

1766
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,000
yesterday say that

1767
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,680
um

1768
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,680
and i think i understand what that means

1769
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,079
and the the planning for failure which

1770
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:08,559
was and this was uh

1771
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:10,720
this was a lesson that was specifically

1772
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,480
on uh

1773
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,720
epn uh yeah on uh

1774
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,600
explicitly congesting notification uh

1775
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,560
ecn uh and basically the problem that uh

1776
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,679
when people turned that on

1777
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:30,238
and there were problems and then people

1778
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:34,000
fixed the problems there was no

1779
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,640
incentive for people to turn it on again

1780
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,319
to see if they were still going to have

1781
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:39,600
problems

1782
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,759
uh i think the only

1783
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:44,238
thing like that here

1784
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:45,679
is uh

1785
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:47,679
you know we recognize

1786
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:50,319
we know that we need to recognize when i

1787
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:54,000
say dysfunction i mean that i have added

1788
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,198
uh i have added paths

1789
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:00,399
that aren't helping

1790
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,719
so um

1791
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:04,560
that you know so that's and that's

1792
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,399
people are working on that

1793
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:09,198
uh in in the general case

1794
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:10,799
um

1795
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:13,920
so um

1796
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,600
let me do this

1797
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,679
um

1798
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,439
um

1799
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:23,279
sorry

1800
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,439
i don't click that i click this

1801
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:26,319
yeah

1802
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,799
um this is how this is how this looks to

1803
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:32,560
me and uh i'm happy to be educated

1804
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,759
uh

1805
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:36,000
i think multipath quick looks really

1806
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,040
good

1807
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,439
going through the 9049 impediment list

1808
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:43,600
lessons learned list

1809
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,359
especially for a 00 individual draft

1810
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,600
which is what it is today

1811
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,880
uh recognizing that it's a merge of

1812
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,040
much more you know of mature

1813
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,800
individual drafts

1814
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,760
uh out of the 13 lessons learned

1815
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:00,719
one

1816
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:03,840
plus a half plus a half are only you

1817
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,840
know or worth thinking about

1818
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,600
uh the

1819
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,880
trust

1820
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,800
lessons learned

1821
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,719
neither one of them are relevant and

1822
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:14,719
those were the big problems those are

1823
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:16,400
the show stoppers

1824
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,320
uh that we didn't know what to do with

1825
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,640
at all when we did four nine zero four

1826
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,679
nine

1827
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,640
so uh so that's that's absolutely

1828
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,000
awesome

1829
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,719
for justifying deployment uh like i said

1830
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:32,239
i think that i think that depends on the

1831
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:35,440
uh past election strategy and

1832
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,760
um if you're doing bandwidth aggregation

1833
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:42,080
that would be awesome uh if you're

1834
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,800
closely managing redundancy

1835
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,080
uh especially part of the time

1836
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,199
that might

1837
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:52,560
happen just as well in the uh

1838
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,640
in the application perhaps

1839
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,640
um

1840
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,719
supported endpoint stacks uh depends on

1841
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:05,280
advanced scheduling which was explicitly

1842
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,640
out of scope

1843
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,640
for this the first version of this

1844
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,960
merged draft

1845
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,840
so i'm looking for understanding more

1846
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,679
about what that means

1847
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:18,480
uh but that gets me into kind of the

1848
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,920
path selection

1849
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,520
uh talk that i did uh at the last uh

1850
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,520
ietf in penargy

1851
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,360
um

1852
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,000
so you know like i say that's something

1853
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:30,960
to

1854
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,080
talk about

1855
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,280
um

1856
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:35,280
just recognizing that if whatever

1857
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,360
advanced scheduling

1858
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,080
means isn't advanced enough your app

1859
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,840
will be doing the

1860
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,719
uh advanced scheduling

1861
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:47,120
and so

1862
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,440
if your app is doing that

1863
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,280
you're not exploiting what's in an

1864
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,800
endpoint stack

1865
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,400
that i'm not telling you that's wrong

1866
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,000
i'm telling you

1867
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,239
i'm just going through the checklist

1868
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:00,320
and planning on failure does depend on

1869
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,480
knowing when to discard paths that

1870
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:03,679
aren't helpful

1871
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:05,920
and uh that's something that people are

1872
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,640
still working on

1873
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,199
i would like to pause for a moment of

1874
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:12,800
appreciation

1875
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,440
not for me but for the people that have

1876
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,920
done the work on that has gone into this

1877
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,280
draft

1878
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,440
and after that

1879
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,559
i would like to

1880
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:28,080
have a conversation

1881
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,719
and i should probably be looking to see

1882
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:39,600
who's in the queue

1883
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,159
so i should i'll stop looking at that

1884
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:43,600
okay cool

1885
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,120
um

1886
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,600
is anybody who was typing

1887
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,400
finished typing long enough to

1888
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,599
come to the mic now or

1889
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,640
these are you know these are certainly

1890
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:57,840
comments we can talk about on the

1891
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,440
mailing list

1892
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,599
but

1893
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,440
what you got

1894
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,080
hi cyril

1895
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,090
cyril are you are you sending

1896
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:22,229
[Music]

1897
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,840
you go are you sending audio

1898
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,159
i i'm not i'm not hearing cyril is

1899
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,559
anybody

1900
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,280
so you have to click on both the video

1901
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,080
and the audio to send

1902
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,400
he is sending audio

1903
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,960
although it might not be working

1904
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,239
we cannot hear you cyril

1905
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:53,440
uh and if the note taker just says cyril

1906
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,640
uh had questions that may be in the

1907
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,880
in the chat uh i would know what that

1908
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,199
means

1909
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:02,640
okay he's going to touch or if somebody

1910
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,719
or somebody wanted to relay it he's

1911
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:05,920
going to attack his question i'll relay

1912
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:06,880
it

1913
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,360
okay cool

1914
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,679
i think this is the last thing on our

1915
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:15,679
agenda other than the open mic so

1916
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:18,960
i think we could take a little time

1917
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:25,960
it sounds like the question is very long

1918
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,760
this will be a difficult one for you

1919
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,239
spencer

1920
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:37,000
super easy barely an inconvenience

1921
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,040
so there was a thing that while we're

1922
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,719
waiting for cyril there was a thing that

1923
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:49,280
that uh med said in the chat uh that i

1924
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,440
just wanted to raise um

1925
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,280
uh he pointed out that like you know

1926
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,199
would not necessarily tag benefits for

1927
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,520
early adopters is no problem

1928
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,000
um and i think we should also recognize

1929
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,880
one of the things that's happened since

1930
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,400
quick

1931
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,520
um

1932
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,480
is that before quick we used to think

1933
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,280
that like in the transport space

1934
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,320
um it was very difficult to to

1935
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,320
deploy any transport protocol because

1936
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,560
you had to own both endpoints

1937
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,679
and then

1938
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,159
with quick you had it you know various

1939
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:23,920
entities that owned well i mean google

1940
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,360
who owned you know

1941
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,760
the stack on the phone and the

1942
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,360
the global front end

1943
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,239
um

1944
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:31,840
where you could actually do this and

1945
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,440
once that happened

1946
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,440
once that initial

1947
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,360
deployment bump

1948
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,560
hit

1949
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,120
um other people could could leverage off

1950
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,640
of it right like as soon as there

1951
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,679
existed

1952
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:44,800
one

1953
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,199
owned both endpoints deployment

1954
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:49,199
then it's obvious

1955
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:51,440
that there's um you know other ways that

1956
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,040
you can hang off of that

1957
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,800
uh and

1958
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,600
i'm wondering if that's maybe sort of a

1959
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,719
meta comment on the on the um

1960
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:02,080
the what not to do

1961
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,600
uh rfc

1962
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,640
is

1963
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,840
like with with quick there was you know

1964
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,000
there was first adopter benefit but it

1965
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,679
had to be a very specific set of first

1966
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:13,199
adopters but once that happened there

1967
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:15,679
was enormous second adopter benefit

1968
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:17,280
um so i mean there's a little bit of

1969
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,040
like a semantic question to happen i

1970
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,960
think i'm just raising this more

1971
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:21,920
uh

1972
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,159
to wait for cyril who has now typed his

1973
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,600
question but it's interesting to

1974
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,280
recognize that like the way that we

1975
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,480
would have phrased that question 10

1976
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,920
years ago is a little bit different than

1977
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,920
what it means right now

1978
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,920
okay so we so

1979
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,400
let me let me just say this

1980
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,719
because i think you're uh

1981
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,800
making a really important point that

1982
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,880
should be somewhere between

1983
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,520
uh this discussion an open mic

1984
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:49,120
which is which is that um

1985
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,520
we did what not to do

1986
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:52,719
because

1987
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:55,120
the things the impediments to for our

1988
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,280
deployment there were things that had

1989
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,719
been impediments for deployment for

1990
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:03,280
in many in some cases decades

1991
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,719
i think the oldest one that's

1992
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:10,000
contributed uh was one from gory on st2

1993
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,760
you know and i mean there are people on

1994
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,440
this call who are younger than sd2

1995
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,320
so uh but i mean

1996
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,800
but it was still a pr you know that

1997
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,199
that that lesson never went away

1998
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:24,960
um

1999
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,440
we have been asked repeatedly while we

2000
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:32,400
were working on the what not to do draft

2001
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,560
where's the list of things that we

2002
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,040
should do

2003
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:40,239
and uh i'm having gone through the

2004
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:43,679
exercise with multi-path quick

2005
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:47,760
i'm wondering if it's time for

2006
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,600
us to think about

2007
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,640
producing a

2008
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,159
document about

2009
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:59,199
something in this space and you know if

2010
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:02,320
if the answer is if the answer is that

2011
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,920
um

2012
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,800
we are fundamentally changing the way

2013
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,960
the internet looks

2014
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,480
um

2015
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,719
at you know at end points and in the

2016
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:14,000
network

2017
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,120
um as fast as we can

2018
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,320
uh

2019
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:21,199
that might be a good thing to recognize

2020
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:24,239
uh like you know like i said you know uh

2021
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:27,760
i would say about half the

2022
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,320
things on the list of impediments to

2023
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,600
deployment

2024
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,280
are things that

2025
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,040
shouldn't matter

2026
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,440
for modern

2027
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:41,919
applications using modern transports

2028
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:48,080
maybe take the rest of that uh to um

2029
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,640
to open my open mic yeah absolutely yeah

2030
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,040
sure and uh i'll relay cyril's question

2031
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,120
uh cyril would say that partial

2032
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,640
deployment heavily depends on the

2033
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,640
existence of different high quality

2034
01:18:58,640 --> 01:18:59,600
paths

2035
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,040
if there are no good alternative paths

2036
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,560
and there's essentially no benefit for

2037
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,040
mpquik

2038
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:09,280
right uh so um

2039
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,600
we we we've had we've had that we've had

2040
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,159
the note uh i've had the conversation

2041
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:15,840
sometime this week and i can't even

2042
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,520
remember which document or which working

2043
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,000
group saying that basically

2044
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,560
you can't do better than the path you

2045
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,560
know you you can't get better

2046
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,159
um

2047
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:27,760
you can't get better experiences out of

2048
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,600
the network than the network can give

2049
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,640
you

2050
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,520
and so i i and that's but i mean that's

2051
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,320
not a that's not a trivial observation

2052
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:40,000
uh it's it's it's true and from my

2053
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
perspective it's true and it's true

2054
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,360
enough to where we're talking about it

2055
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,840
at the ietf in at least a couple of

2056
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:46,960
places

2057
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,800
so i think i think

2058
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,120
you know again that's the kind of

2059
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,719
uh thing where

2060
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:54,560
the the

2061
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,120
the meaning of the impediments

2062
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,600
may have changed enough to where it's

2063
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,520
worth looking at

2064
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:02,560
uh

2065
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,960
where we are now as opposed to where we

2066
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:05,920
were

2067
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,840
when the uh

2068
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,080
as opposed to where we were

2069
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,080
when the uh

2070
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:15,120
we started work on uh well we started

2071
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:19,040
pin our our energy in the first

2072
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,639
so gory might have something to say

2073
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:23,040
about that

2074
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,840
yeah i mean

2075
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,360
i agree with what cyril said

2076
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,400
but then

2077
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,679
the question is what does a high quality

2078
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:37,440
path mean

2079
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:40,320
if i'm if i'm really searching for

2080
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:43,440
robustness because i have um

2081
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,440
a wonderful fiber optic cable but it

2082
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,239
keeps somehow breaking i'm happy to take

2083
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:51,679
nicholas's very low speed

2084
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:54,639
old-fashioned technology maybe using an

2085
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:56,560
ancient satellite system with very high

2086
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,320
delay

2087
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,880
low bandwidth because it's my backup and

2088
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,679
therefore failing over to that is okay

2089
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:05,440
but if i'm looking for

2090
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,679
bandwidth that's not a great solution at

2091
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,920
all i'd rather not do it so i really

2092
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,280
think the scheduling of what you're

2093
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,120
trying to get out of it

2094
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,800
makes the biggest difference to what is

2095
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,480
a high quality alternative path

2096
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,560
i agree and i'm looking i was i was

2097
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,719
scanning through the attendee list

2098
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,239
looking for

2099
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:30,159
uh miriam uh who seems to oh no she's

2100
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:32,239
there she is there she is excellent

2101
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:34,000
mariah uh

2102
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,120
could you do uh

2103
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:39,760
whatever the right length is commercial

2104
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:44,080
for the iab workshop on measuring

2105
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,800
user experience

2106
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,520
that we you all talked about at the or

2107
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,360
whatever the title is that you all

2108
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,840
talked about at the last

2109
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,360
session in

2110
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:58,159
iv open

2111
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,520
um i could but i don't know if there's a

2112
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,960
commercial needed because that workshop

2113
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,639
was run in september so there's a

2114
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:06,320
commercial for reading the report which

2115
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,840
is out right now

2116
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:08,639
yeah

2117
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:10,480
yes yes

2118
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,080
exactly

2119
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,080
cool uh and

2120
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,040
um

2121
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,199
maria could could you uh

2122
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:19,440
put a link to that either in the chat

2123
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,920
for gory or in the notes

2124
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,719
but i i i think that i think that that's

2125
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:27,520
i think that this is a really important

2126
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:31,280
uh point to make which is that um the

2127
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,239
con

2128
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:33,600
so

2129
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:38,960
i i was in the i was in the iab open

2130
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,159
session

2131
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:42,800
uh where the workshop was described and

2132
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,480
i think they said they had up to 90

2133
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,480
people participating

2134
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,159
um

2135
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:51,199
so you know and and and uh

2136
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,679
wes uh said he was

2137
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:55,440
terrified of the thought i think it was

2138
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,120
wes was terrified of the thought of

2139
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,560
trying to summarize that and that's

2140
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,239
before significant deployment of

2141
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:03,840
multipath

2142
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,920
so i think that i think that that's

2143
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,520
going to be a really interesting

2144
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,840
conversation to have

2145
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,000
if people from

2146
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,440
penargy

2147
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,600
take a look at that report and try to

2148
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,440
imagine what

2149
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:18,320
what

2150
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:22,239
that means in our world

2151
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,840
so i strongly strongly agree with gory

2152
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:26,800
yes

2153
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,719
strongly agree with benson can i try a

2154
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:29,920
part b

2155
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,080
to the statement to try and know to

2156
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,080
annoy you

2157
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,120
which

2158
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,159
is

2159
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:39,520
when we did rsvp we needed the app to

2160
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,520
tell us exactly what it wanted from the

2161
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,199
network

2162
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:45,360
and if only it told us exactly what it

2163
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,000
wanted then we could try and give it but

2164
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,840
then most apps didn't know what they

2165
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:50,800
want

2166
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,239
so is the

2167
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:54,880
selecting the scheduler and what

2168
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,719
multi-path properties you want something

2169
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:59,280
that's very clear to the app and can

2170
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,880
tell you or is it one that we should be

2171
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,040
a um

2172
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,639
worried about because they the apps

2173
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:07,440
won't know what they want

2174
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:10,639
so so on the on this item here that i've

2175
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:12,800
got my cursor on about support and

2176
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,280
import stacks

2177
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,920
one of the things that was involved with

2178
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,239
that was saying

2179
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:22,800
can the application

2180
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:23,920
convey

2181
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,920
meaningfully

2182
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,199
what it's trying to do

2183
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,480
to the you know to anything further down

2184
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,239
and i mean this and this wasn't yeah

2185
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:36,560
this was even in the end points right

2186
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,719
you know it's like can you know

2187
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:42,800
can my you know can my app tell me

2188
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,080
can i you know can the app tell

2189
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:49,360
something further down that this is a

2190
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,280
gaming application and

2191
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:54,480
uh really low latency really matters and

2192
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:58,560
or even worse uh i've just moved my eyes

2193
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:02,000
in an ar application and so now all of a

2194
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
sudden

2195
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,159
the definition of what

2196
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:08,400
needs to be reliable and what doesn't

2197
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,520
need to be reliable is getting worse

2198
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,239
so i yeah so yes i uh

2199
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:16,159
i agree with i agree with gory's

2200
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:18,320
question that that's a very

2201
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:23,320
fascinating thing for us to to look at

2202
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,239
i should probably have put this up this

2203
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:31,440
one up

2204
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,400
um

2205
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,400
because we're starting to get into that

2206
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:37,759
territory but uh

2207
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,480
we can go back and leave this one of

2208
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,560
course um

2209
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,360
what else you got

2210
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,960
i need to scan back up so where i can

2211
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:50,600
see the top of the queue

2212
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:00,400
going once

2213
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,080
ah okay cool

2214
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:09,920
yes how can i help okay well here ever

2215
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,440
question not uh

2216
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,120
not the specific tool quick but

2217
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,639
something to compare

2218
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:18,639
you know for the atss or mptcp in

2219
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:20,239
5g domain

2220
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:22,159
we're going to have some proxy on the

2221
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:24,159
upf it's like uh

2222
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:26,159
in the middle to do some aggregation

2223
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:27,920
work for mptcp

2224
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,679
well for a quick from your description

2225
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:31,360
for the multi-pass quick it's like

2226
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,920
everything regarding the multipaths will

2227
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:34,719
be

2228
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:36,239
deployed on the

2229
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:38,080
other devices

2230
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,159
so here since we have two different

2231
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:42,159
strategies why is put something between

2232
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:45,760
one is uh on the on the device

2233
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,320
uh i'm not sure have you ever compared

2234
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,360
this type of things you know

2235
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,280
yeah just to try to get in your opinion

2236
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,600
it's like especially for this pen

2237
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,320
research group

2238
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:01,520
so

2239
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,679
i would say

2240
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:06,719
that um

2241
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,520
and

2242
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,360
there are people there are people in

2243
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,080
this research group that know about a

2244
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:17,280
lot more than what went into

2245
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:20,560
rc 9049

2246
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,800
but we didn't have

2247
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,800
contributions to that draft

2248
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:30,840
that asked you know that we're trying to

2249
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,639
explain

2250
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:34,960
that situation and part of the you know

2251
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:38,320
part of that is that atss is has

2252
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,040
uh it's not that old

2253
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,719
you know one of the you know one of the

2254
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:44,719
goals one of the goals where we started

2255
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:46,719
the that draft and this

2256
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:49,040
this did not turn out to be

2257
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,800
uh

2258
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,719
this you know this did not turn out to

2259
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:53,840
be

2260
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:54,719
uh

2261
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:57,679
a consideration

2262
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,520
for all the for all the contributions of

2263
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,560
the draft but you know

2264
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,320
basically we've been working on path

2265
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,159
aware networking for at least a decade

2266
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:08,239
we haven't been able to deploy

2267
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:10,719
any of it so uh

2268
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:12,560
why is that

2269
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:15,280
and so uh

2270
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:18,320
we have not talked about that

2271
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,280
much

2272
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,320
in this

2273
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:23,120
research group that i can remember

2274
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,239
um

2275
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:25,679
i think that

2276
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:26,639
you're

2277
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:29,760
but i think you're asking um

2278
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,520
a

2279
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:34,159
very useful question here

2280
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:36,080
because i

2281
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,280
one of the you know one of the

2282
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,960
possibilities

2283
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,960
is that if you were trying to do

2284
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,639
something like

2285
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:44,320
3gpp

2286
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,679
does with atss

2287
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:50,239
where you have um

2288
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:52,080
intermediary

2289
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:54,800
between the endpoints

2290
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,600
that's in that case doing uh

2291
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,000
tcp connection aggregation

2292
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,320
uh across multiple paths and things like

2293
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:03,199
that

2294
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:04,800
if you're trying to do something like

2295
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,719
that

2296
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:09,840
in five years maybe pick a number but in

2297
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,120
five years

2298
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,520
you may be

2299
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,639
trying to do things with mask

2300
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:19,040
intermediate devices

2301
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:21,360
which

2302
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:24,639
could also be doing similar kinds of

2303
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:25,760
things

2304
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,080
um

2305
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,639
give it you know given that

2306
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:32,719
given that what's happening is still in

2307
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:33,840
the end

2308
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,600
between the endpoints

2309
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,800
but i think that i think that

2310
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,040
this is a really interesting topic to

2311
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,480
talk about

2312
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,320
in pen rg

2313
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,000
and

2314
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,400
tommy paulie

2315
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,920
from apple

2316
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,480
talked about their experiences with

2317
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,239
using uh

2318
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:55,760
mask for

2319
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:58,239
routing

2320
01:29:58,239 --> 01:30:00,880
at the last penrg

2321
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,960
111 meeting

2322
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,480
so you know

2323
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,719
i think that's i think that

2324
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:08,239
the question you're asking is an

2325
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:10,719
important question to ask

2326
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:13,280
and i think pnrg

2327
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:16,639
is a good place to ask that question

2328
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:18,159
thank you thank you for thank you for

2329
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:21,638
raising it

2330
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,040
maybe is it related to the

2331
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,880
like architecture of 5g here we have a

2332
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,800
upf that can sit

2333
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,320
in between

2334
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:31,840
yeah that is the thing we have the

2335
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,639
flexibility so and that and that's

2336
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:36,080
really that like i said that's really

2337
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:37,199
the question

2338
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:39,760
is we i think we kind of

2339
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:43,040
if you if you go back and look at

2340
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:43,840
uh

2341
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:47,040
slides one eight and nine in this slide

2342
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,719
deck

2343
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:51,280
you'll see some of the things that we

2344
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,480
uh

2345
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:56,080
had concerns about with

2346
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:58,960
intermediate devices

2347
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,280
and

2348
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:04,800
as as things that impeded deployment

2349
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,880
uh and you know one of the things for

2350
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,960
mptcp was

2351
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,320
uh

2352
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,920
that

2353
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,840
there were a heck of a lot of servers

2354
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,000
that knew more about tcp than they knew

2355
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:16,800
about

2356
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,639
mptcp

2357
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:20,159
so you know one of the one of the

2358
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:22,239
reasons you have that

2359
01:31:22,239 --> 01:31:24,960
what upf in 5g

2360
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,920
is to do the protocol conversion from

2361
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:31,280
mpc tcp to tcp

2362
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,280
and you know and that big that made

2363
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,840
perfect sense in that in that case

2364
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:36,960
um

2365
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,639
the you know

2366
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:42,000
i i think what we're saying is that the

2367
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,000
definition of intermediary devices

2368
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,080
may be changing in the network that

2369
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:51,199
we're looking at as well

2370
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:53,599
thank you

2371
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:59,159
others

2372
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,080
hey brian how's it going

2373
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,120
good

2374
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,440
it's been a while since

2375
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,199
good to see you um

2376
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:10,880
so i i think i'm going to ask this

2377
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:14,000
question uh maybe as a way of like sort

2378
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,800
of like spilling into the open mic uh

2379
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,639
section and talking about this

2380
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:19,679
uh there

2381
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:21,520
there's a lot of

2382
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,920
i think this this um

2383
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,360
you know support and endpoints stacks

2384
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,600
depending on advanced scheduling

2385
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:30,639
um i think that is a

2386
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:35,120
a oh no no no no no um

2387
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:40,678
i i i think that is a um

2388
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:42,639
multipath in this case is sort of a

2389
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:44,239
special case of the generalized case of

2390
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:45,840
path awareness right

2391
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,880
and i think one of the big um

2392
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,320
uh

2393
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,719
issues that we would run into going into

2394
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:55,199
the future with respect to

2395
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:56,960
like you know the

2396
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,199
the broad vision of this research group

2397
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:00,639
is let us make

2398
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:02,960
um the endpoints in the internet which

2399
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,880
we're not going to define right now uh

2400
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,120
pathware which we're going to define

2401
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:10,480
with uh energy questions uh dash 11

2402
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,480
which is now uh available for your

2403
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:15,280
consideration as document shepard um i i

2404
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,600
fixed that uh during the break

2405
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,159
the um

2406
01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:27,440
mp quick i think is going to have a

2407
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,560
uh

2408
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,239
is going to be a really interesting

2409
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:32,080
testing ground for

2410
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,000
that advanced scheduling question right

2411
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,239
because like one of the things that that

2412
01:33:36,239 --> 01:33:38,639
you know is is hiding behind the whole

2413
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:40,480
side discussion in the chat over here is

2414
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,280
that

2415
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,760
the advanced scheduler is

2416
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:44,880
like

2417
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,560
different situations call for a

2418
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,560
different scheduling

2419
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,639
right and i i think that to some extent

2420
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:52,320
you know the deployment of mp quick is

2421
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,320
going to be the deployment of the

2422
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,080
actuation side

2423
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:58,080
of path aware networking

2424
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,239
uh before we have sort of like that the

2425
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:01,440
sensing and the awareness side of

2426
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,040
pathway networking and i don't know that

2427
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:04,560
there's any

2428
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,960
like question there i think it's just

2429
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,080
i'm not even sure that it's a

2430
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:09,760
non-obvious insight

2431
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,600
but it's it's

2432
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,280
i'm very excited to see the mp quick

2433
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,480
stuff

2434
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:17,440
moving forward as a

2435
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,440
deployable way in the current internet

2436
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:20,960
with a deployment model that we know

2437
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,800
works from quick

2438
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,159
to start experimenting with some of the

2439
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:28,159
the problems that are going to be sort

2440
01:34:28,159 --> 01:34:29,760
of like so difficult and detailed in

2441
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:30,880
path that we're not working that we

2442
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:32,480
didn't even raise them as a question

2443
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:34,320
right it's like we're all in path or

2444
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,840
networking we're all about how do we get

2445
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,760
good information to the end point we

2446
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,040
kind of make an assumption the endpoint

2447
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,400
will be able to use that information

2448
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:43,360
properly and imp quick is is

2449
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,679
is going to dig into that so um

2450
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:46,960
i have nothing

2451
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,480
to say other than it is an interesting

2452
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:52,480
and exciting time to be alive i guess

2453
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,480
i would i i i'm hoping that many of the

2454
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,239
people that are

2455
01:34:58,239 --> 01:35:00,560
at the this ietf are actually alive

2456
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,880
depending on where you're where you are

2457
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,280
in your sleep patterns um

2458
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:08,639
but ignoring ignoring that for a second

2459
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:12,159
uh one other thing that i wanted to

2460
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:15,280
say that i

2461
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:18,000
couldn't possibly describe in writing

2462
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,239
right now

2463
01:35:20,239 --> 01:35:22,480
is

2464
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:26,480
discussions that are happening on an itf

2465
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:27,760
mailing list

2466
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:28,880
that is

2467
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:29,760
for

2468
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,520
media over quick

2469
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,360
or mock

2470
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:36,080
moq

2471
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,199
and

2472
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:41,440
we had a side meeting earlier this week

2473
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:42,480
that was

2474
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,920
amazing

2475
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,840
in the number of things that people were

2476
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,520
thinking about

2477
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,840
for media

2478
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:50,880
okay

2479
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:51,840
and

2480
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,880
i did not dare open my mouth and say

2481
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,280
anything about multiple paths

2482
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:00,080
for any of that discussion

2483
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,239
but i mean this is this is like the

2484
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:04,080
here's the gaming here you know here's

2485
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:04,960
the

2486
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:07,280
here's the applications where

2487
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,159
uh

2488
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:10,080
we're ready yo here's the applications

2489
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:11,840
where we're ready to

2490
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:14,000
uh closely tie

2491
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,080
our uh

2492
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:17,280
codec

2493
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,639
processing

2494
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:21,280
to our transport processing

2495
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:22,800
uh

2496
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,400
there's a there was a paper

2497
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:27,280
there was a paper uh it was actually an

2498
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:28,880
ietf

2499
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:31,840
111

2500
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:37,280
advanced networking research prize talk

2501
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,920
uh called salsify that talked about

2502
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,159
things like you know things like that

2503
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:43,679
as an example

2504
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:45,119
but i mean

2505
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:46,880
i

2506
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,440
i think we're talking about a a real

2507
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:52,080
food fight coming up over there and

2508
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,000
that's going to have a lot to do with

2509
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,560
what people are trying to do

2510
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,600
with their internet connections

2511
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,600
uh and

2512
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,320
the you know the opportunity for

2513
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:08,000
uh multipath to make that better

2514
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,400
or to make that worse

2515
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,639
uh seems like a seems like a helpful

2516
01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:14,960
thing for us to be thinking about

2517
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:18,320
probably in a place like pnrg

2518
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,000
and i'm not like i said i'm not talking

2519
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,400
about i'm not talking about

2520
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:23,520
uh

2521
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:26,000
i'm not talking about congestion control

2522
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,119
particularly at all you know i see crg

2523
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:31,119
as a perfectly fine

2524
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:33,360
chartered research group for that

2525
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:34,880
i'm talking about everything else that

2526
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,880
seems to be going on

2527
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:39,760
so um

2528
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,080
yeah

2529
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:45,119
uh chris

2530
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:49,840
i see you in the queue

2531
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:54,320
hello uh hi oh am i sending yes i am um

2532
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,800
so i i said this in the chat but um

2533
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:59,119
corey said i should say the mic so yes i

2534
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:00,320
probably should

2535
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,119
um

2536
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:02,639
it was just

2537
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:04,159
it was just

2538
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:06,719
thinking aloud about what happens where

2539
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:09,920
you have um

2540
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,119
a

2541
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:13,040
future world where

2542
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:16,400
um endpoints and i think event points as

2543
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,080
phones because that's what i do

2544
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:19,440
um

2545
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,360
so these phones

2546
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:22,719
are

2547
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:25,119
multipath quick enabled and they use it

2548
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:27,280
by default and they are

2549
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,440
because they're phones they have two

2550
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,199
main connections they've got a wi-fi and

2551
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:32,239
they've got

2552
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:34,480
the cellular network

2553
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:37,520
and they try to use both and they

2554
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,440
in it if they do that independently

2555
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:42,480
probably works really well

2556
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:45,920
except that their wi-fi

2557
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,960
um may eventually be

2558
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,080
using

2559
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,960
an isp network that is also multi-path

2560
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,080
and it's

2561
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:54,430
um

2562
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:55,840
[Music]

2563
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:58,639
one way that could happen is 80 triple s

2564
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:00,719
it's not the only way um

2565
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:03,520
but is if if we assume that

2566
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,040
the

2567
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,199
the isps multipath

2568
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:08,159
is

2569
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:11,119
something that works with udp packets so

2570
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:13,600
such as multipath tccp

2571
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:14,719
then

2572
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:17,040
uh we clearly have

2573
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:20,239
um a complex set of behaviors that we

2574
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:21,760
have to manage and

2575
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:22,800
yeah

2576
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:23,679
um

2577
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:26,560
med said that yeah

2578
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:27,600
it's

2579
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:28,560
um

2580
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,800
we've we've also got there different

2581
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,239
entities

2582
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:35,199
um deciding the steering policies as

2583
01:39:35,199 --> 01:39:36,719
well so

2584
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:37,920
um

2585
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:41,440
the chance that they agree it's like

2586
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,800
um

2587
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:43,520
and

2588
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:46,000
even if they do agree i mean it that is

2589
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,080
let's say that they both have the same

2590
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:50,480
aims but they

2591
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:51,600
um

2592
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:52,960
they're they're both trying to maximize

2593
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,600
throughput say and they're both using

2594
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,920
uh both paths as much as they can but

2595
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:00,159
they

2596
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,800
we in in reality

2597
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:04,719
they're both trying to

2598
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:07,840
use um

2599
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,360
radio network

2600
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:10,480
in the same way they're trying to

2601
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:12,560
they're competing with each other so

2602
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:14,480
it's all a bit weird to me and i don't

2603
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,000
know what the right answer is i just

2604
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,520
know that it's

2605
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,880
looking um like it might need some more

2606
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:23,840
thinking about

2607
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,360
i'm almost positive that that's true

2608
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,280
um

2609
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,119
is it helpful

2610
01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:33,840
or is it a hostile act and i'm probably

2611
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:34,880
asking

2612
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:37,440
jen and brian

2613
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:41,360
for me to put a link in the chat or in

2614
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:42,639
the notes

2615
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:46,239
to the draft that

2616
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:47,600
we had

2617
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:48,840
about

2618
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:51,520
atss for

2619
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:54,159
the quick interim on multipath that was

2620
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:57,679
like 2020 i think

2621
01:40:57,679 --> 01:40:59,600
would that would that be helpful i don't

2622
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:03,679
want to sell atss here

2623
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,760
but

2624
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,880
when people when people from the

2625
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,400
world where

2626
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:13,440
endpoints or phones are talking to us

2627
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:16,080
often often that's the context that they

2628
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:19,760
have that a lot of us don't

2629
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,679
i think uh

2630
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:24,239
i i would probably put that on the list

2631
01:41:24,239 --> 01:41:26,080
uh but please do send links to that

2632
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,239
because i think there might be

2633
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:29,440
some people

2634
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,360
in this research group but myself

2635
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:33,280
included who have kind of not paid a lot

2636
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:36,560
of attention to that right so

2637
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:37,840
yeah there are people there are people

2638
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,760
in this research group who were

2639
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,560
co-authors with me on that draft so

2640
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,639
uh you know you know there's there's a

2641
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:47,440
real range yes absolutely

2642
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:51,199
the uh the other thing i would say is

2643
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:52,960
uh i am not

2644
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:56,719
the whisperer for 3gpp

2645
01:41:56,719 --> 01:41:59,440
um but i

2646
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,520
am

2647
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,040
contributing

2648
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:05,440
to discussions about

2649
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:06,239
uh

2650
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:08,560
release 18

2651
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:10,400
aspects of

2652
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:12,840
of atss

2653
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:15,760
and things that are i mean these are

2654
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,600
things that are being openly contributed

2655
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,840
so you could go look them up if you're

2656
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:24,000
so inclined to know where to look uh are

2657
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,360
proposals which have not been accepted

2658
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:29,839
for

2659
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:32,239
three

2660
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:34,719
paths

2661
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:38,639
which might include which might include

2662
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:41,639
two

2663
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:45,440
which might include two different wi-fi

2664
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:46,639
paths

2665
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:49,600
uh which might include uh

2666
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,800
along with your say uh 5g connection

2667
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:55,199
which might include five to five g

2668
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:58,400
connections along with your wi-fi path

2669
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:01,520
uh and some other combinations there

2670
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:03,840
and so a lot of the a lot of the

2671
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:06,239
complexity there is going to be

2672
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:07,920
problems that

2673
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:11,360
3gpp has to solve

2674
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,880
because there are you know because

2675
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,119
there's a lot of interaction with the

2676
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:16,400
core network

2677
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,400
uh in 5g

2678
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,320
but i think there's you know you say i

2679
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,080
think there's you know for us to

2680
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:25,080
recognize

2681
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:29,679
how did i how did i say this um

2682
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:33,360
not that one

2683
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,639
yeah that one

2684
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:39,360
becoming more common you know

2685
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:40,159
because

2686
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:41,760
this is becoming more

2687
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:43,920
common more deployable and more

2688
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,080
ambitious

2689
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,400
for multipath and i think i can make

2690
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:50,000
that statement

2691
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,800
not just being a statement about

2692
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:55,199
the ietf

2693
01:43:55,199 --> 01:43:57,280
and not just about the open internet as

2694
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:58,960
we understand it

2695
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:04,159
i think that that's true for hyperscaler

2696
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:06,480
people

2697
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,639
uh who are doing things who are doing

2698
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:10,719
things with multi-path or who can be

2699
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:12,719
doing things with multi-path inside

2700
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:14,080
their networks

2701
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,639
even if that's not the open internet i

2702
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:18,560
think that that's definitely true for

2703
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:22,719
the 5g people uh because

2704
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:24,719
it's not you know what they're trying to

2705
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:27,679
do is not unambitious now

2706
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:30,239
and it

2707
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:32,080
looks to me like

2708
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:34,800
there are proposals to be more ambitious

2709
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:37,199
so yeah i think i think that this is a

2710
01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:38,960
thing

2711
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:42,719
as far as you know as far as

2712
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:46,080
profitable ways for

2713
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,600
pan rg

2714
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:50,719
researchers to be

2715
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:53,440
spending time

2716
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:56,639
so i i have often made uh

2717
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:59,199
often at least twice in pecha kuchas i

2718
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:01,440
have made sort of like the side joke

2719
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,119
that the easiest way to end a meeting in

2720
01:45:03,119 --> 01:45:05,679
transport is to yell multipath and run

2721
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:08,080
out of the room uh i do want to check

2722
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:09,199
with other

2723
01:45:09,199 --> 01:45:10,880
like this is a really interesting

2724
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:12,480
conversation uh you don't necessarily

2725
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:14,719
need to send that link at least for me

2726
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:16,639
to the list because i already found the

2727
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:18,560
document med put the link in the chat a

2728
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:21,280
while ago um but it might make sense to

2729
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:23,280
to send something out to the list uh for

2730
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:25,119
people who are not here who are sort of

2731
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:26,320
interested in this

2732
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,639
as chair i did want to make sure that we

2733
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:30,880
have you know we promised 40 minutes of

2734
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:33,119
open mic time we have 15.

2735
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:35,199
uh i did uh want to make sure that we

2736
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:37,280
don't take um all of the time on

2737
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,760
multipath because um multipath will take

2738
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:41,280
all of the time if we want to

2739
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:42,960
um

2740
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:45,440
so i would say uh

2741
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,199
spencer you could stay up here uh in

2742
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:49,440
case people have more questions on this

2743
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,679
uh but i would say if you have anything

2744
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:54,000
to raise at the pan rg open mic about

2745
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,520
you know what we're doing

2746
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:57,040
uh what we should be doing what we

2747
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:58,320
should not be doing other than

2748
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,560
apparently um a bunch of multi-pass

2749
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:03,199
stuff uh and other than looking deeply

2750
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:05,040
at satellites uh both which i'm kind of

2751
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,600
excited about um

2752
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:08,560
uh

2753
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,840
now is your opportunity to come

2754
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:15,199
to uh the mic and open that and if

2755
01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:16,560
nobody comes for a couple of minutes

2756
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:17,679
i'll open the mic lines back up to

2757
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:19,920
people who want to talk about multipath

2758
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:22,480
uh and i would i would observe two

2759
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:25,360
things one is that the satellite thing

2760
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:27,199
has a potential

2761
01:46:27,199 --> 01:46:30,239
multi-path aspect as well so

2762
01:46:30,239 --> 01:46:32,400
you can run but you can't hide and

2763
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:35,040
number two if i wanted to try to end a

2764
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:36,960
transport meeting i would have said

2765
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:39,119
multicast

2766
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:42,400
uh yeah it's even worse

2767
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:46,800
the mic lines are open there are many

2768
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:50,320
and many it is a multi mic line

2769
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,400
hi actually well i have a fundamental

2770
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,800
question regarding the multi-path here

2771
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,800
so here we're talking about the path

2772
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:01,199
aware in the research group

2773
01:47:01,199 --> 01:47:04,000
so in order for like a device to

2774
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,119
determine whether it should go use uh

2775
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:09,760
which path or even pray for one or the

2776
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:12,719
other or whether select the both or even

2777
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:14,080
three passes

2778
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:16,880
does the in the device have to

2779
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:20,239
get some past aware detect something

2780
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:22,880
before it made decision if it does not

2781
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:26,639
so why it's called past aware

2782
01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:29,520
so i think that's sort of like that's a

2783
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:30,560
a

2784
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:31,440
a

2785
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,520
a gigantic open question right now the

2786
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:35,360
way that that all of this works is you

2787
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:36,800
either have the end point that has two

2788
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,480
paths and it'll do measurement

2789
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:40,080
right and it's going to attempt to

2790
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:41,920
infer some things

2791
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:44,320
about which path is what it

2792
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,800
in in some cases it's it's fairly easy

2793
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:48,960
to do that if you know you know

2794
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:50,800
something about the initial network

2795
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:52,560
technology you can say oh i'm i'm on a

2796
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,480
lte network i'm in a 5g network i'm

2797
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:56,560
going to guess some things about that

2798
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:59,360
um it's harder to know if you have

2799
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,840
uh you know a satellite in the middle um

2800
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:05,280
which is why you basically will have

2801
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:07,920
proxies so endpoints themselves that

2802
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:10,000
will essentially re-tunnel the thing

2803
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,760
right the question the larger question

2804
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:15,040
in pathway networking is

2805
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:16,480
can we

2806
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:19,520
by adding something beyond just endpoint

2807
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:21,040
sensing so this these these path

2808
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:22,560
properties and giving that information

2809
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:23,600
to the end points wherever those

2810
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:25,119
endpoints happen to be if they're you

2811
01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:26,880
know that the

2812
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,639
the user terminal if it's the front end

2813
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:30,159
at a

2814
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:33,119
a large cdn or if it's you know

2815
01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:34,080
something in the middle of the network

2816
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:35,520
that's doing some tunneling in order to

2817
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:36,639
get around something because it knows

2818
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:38,159
what that path is

2819
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:40,080
um

2820
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:42,239
having some sort of

2821
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:43,679
having a stack that knows how to

2822
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:45,600
communicate about that is is probably

2823
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:46,880
better than having a stack that's going

2824
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:48,960
to guess about it right like so that's

2825
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:50,560
you know i i think the other the other

2826
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,000
question you're asking is is just you

2827
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,360
know a multi-path thing that's doing

2828
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:56,080
measurement path aware

2829
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:57,440
yeah i mean it knows that it's using

2830
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:59,760
multiple paths right but but like sort

2831
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:01,280
of the statement of what we're what

2832
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:02,639
we're kind of trying to do here is sort

2833
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:04,560
of let that first

2834
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:06,080
um

2835
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:07,360
that first section in the questions

2836
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:08,800
document

2837
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:09,760
i don't know did that answer the

2838
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:12,760
question

2839
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:21,280
i think that's a yes

2840
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:24,080
i'm not sure

2841
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:26,719
yeah thank you oh

2842
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:30,480
yeah good go ahead i i want to i want to

2843
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:31,360
uh

2844
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:34,400
be very sympathetic to the last question

2845
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:35,280
uh

2846
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:37,360
one of the so one of the things that's

2847
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:39,920
popping up for me as i was going through

2848
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:43,400
the 9049

2849
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:47,040
checklist

2850
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,520
with multipath quick

2851
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:51,920
was that the meaning of some of the

2852
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,719
words have changed because

2853
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:57,040
the way we're using the network is

2854
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,400
changing

2855
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:01,199
a lot you know if if you think about the

2856
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:03,440
first path-aware networking

2857
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:05,280
research group

2858
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:07,280
proposed research group meeting that we

2859
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:08,840
had

2860
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:13,119
um that was like

2861
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:14,560
in the

2862
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:16,480
you know that was the beginning of that

2863
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:18,159
was the beginning of quick

2864
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:20,320
charter time um

2865
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:22,159
and things like that and so there were a

2866
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:24,000
lot of things that were that we're

2867
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,159
taking for granted

2868
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:28,719
with the way the network seems to be

2869
01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:30,159
going now

2870
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:32,159
that we were not

2871
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:34,560
you know we're not the here of then and

2872
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:37,280
we were talking a lot about signaling

2873
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:39,760
from endpoints to middle to middle

2874
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:42,719
points and from middle points endpoints

2875
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:45,679
so i think that

2876
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:48,480
one of the things that might be helpful

2877
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:49,920
would be

2878
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:50,719
to

2879
01:50:50,719 --> 01:50:54,560
flip open the uh your presentation on

2880
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:57,840
the uh iab review of

2881
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:59,840
of pnrg

2882
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,159
and look at what they what they think

2883
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:03,360
we're doing

2884
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:05,360
because i think that there were things

2885
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:07,360
in that that did not and i'll stop

2886
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:10,719
sharing slides so you could do that but

2887
01:51:10,719 --> 01:51:12,719
i think that there were that they were

2888
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:15,679
looking for something a little broader

2889
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:16,800
than

2890
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,080
the

2891
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:20,480
definition of path awareness that we

2892
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:21,840
were using

2893
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,960
when we had our first meeting

2894
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:26,560
is is that it was

2895
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,080
uh

2896
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,320
jen and uh dan brian is that kind of

2897
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:33,559
your memory

2898
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:37,920
but you but like i say if you could if

2899
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:40,719
you could share that slide from the iab

2900
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:42,960
uh review deck uh

2901
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:44,719
because they were kind of thinking about

2902
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:45,840
things that

2903
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:47,119
they were hope

2904
01:51:47,119 --> 01:51:48,960
the way i the way i understood that

2905
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:51,520
review was these are the things that we

2906
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,560
are hoping that you will continue doing

2907
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:55,679
yes

2908
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:59,599
and uh that was kind of

2909
01:51:59,599 --> 01:52:01,119
that was kind of that was kind of cool

2910
01:52:01,119 --> 01:52:03,839
for me

2911
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:06,800
so yeah i mean like so the three like

2912
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:10,320
like the for for a while

2913
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,560
i think we were spending a lot of time

2914
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:13,920
as

2915
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:16,320
sort of the fourth thing on this list

2916
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,159
right just sort of like a

2917
01:52:18,159 --> 01:52:19,920
a generalized like we were you know we

2918
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:21,360
were running through

2919
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:23,440
uh what not to do we were kind of you

2920
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:25,440
know

2921
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:27,040
continuing to work on questions and

2922
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:29,040
keeping it open in case any others came

2923
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:32,639
up um i think now we're kind of

2924
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:35,679
of um

2925
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:37,440
yeah focusing on sort of like yeah the

2926
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:38,560
research application dependent

2927
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:40,159
properties ietf protocols i think there

2928
01:52:40,159 --> 01:52:41,440
might be

2929
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:43,280
uh there was actually a question in tsv

2930
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:44,560
area

2931
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,080
uh

2932
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,000
the tsp are you meeting this time about

2933
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,119
hey

2934
01:52:49,119 --> 01:52:50,719
uh let me see if martin martin is

2935
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:52,400
probably not here because i think that

2936
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:54,159
his um

2937
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:55,599
uh no martin duke is not here i think

2938
01:52:55,599 --> 01:52:59,719
he's one of he's got a is

2939
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:02,639
yeah yeah so yeah so

2940
01:53:02,639 --> 01:53:04,320
put an idea on the spot that always

2941
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:08,159
works feedback feedback to um the tsp80s

2942
01:53:08,159 --> 01:53:10,080
um

2943
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:12,480
it might be because a lot of the

2944
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,400
interesting things that are happening in

2945
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:16,080
multipath are one

2946
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:19,360
a bit researchy uh and two

2947
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:21,840
are very much about past selection right

2948
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:23,440
like so this whole

2949
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:25,360
nasty how many schedulers do you need

2950
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:26,400
and how do they need to know what

2951
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:27,520
they're doing

2952
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:29,280
uh problem i think

2953
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:30,719
might fit here

2954
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:31,840
um

2955
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:33,840
so that might be a

2956
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:36,800
uh a thing for uh y'all in transport to

2957
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:38,880
consider if you're thinking that there

2958
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:41,199
is a uh

2959
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:44,159
like a need to to touch some of the

2960
01:53:44,159 --> 01:53:46,000
the multi-path

2961
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,440
questions

2962
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:49,440
uh in a single venue where everybody's

2963
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:52,000
kind of talking at the same time uh and

2964
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,080
zohat has listened to the challenge of

2965
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:57,199
being put on the spot side

2966
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:59,679
yeah i think i think

2967
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:01,119
we have been discussing these things

2968
01:54:01,119 --> 01:54:02,960
right i mean multi-party this is not new

2969
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:04,960
topic i mean we know there are some

2970
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:06,639
protocol specific things and there are

2971
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:07,360
some

2972
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:10,320
things that that could go for any any

2973
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:11,920
any any kind of

2974
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:14,320
protocol that is doing multipath like i

2975
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,800
have seen some people was uh worried

2976
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:18,159
that there are too many multiple

2977
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:19,520
protocols gonna be deployed in the

2978
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:22,880
network so i mean i think uh i think me

2979
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:24,560
and martin both um

2980
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:26,639
agree with this fact like we have some

2981
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:28,560
research thing going through such a

2982
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:30,639
thing needed for multi-part and we also

2983
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:33,040
need some protocol a specific thing

2984
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:34,960
needed to be done in a different working

2985
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:37,040
group existing working group and we are

2986
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:39,040
also thinking about like where where is

2987
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:41,520
the right place to fix uh put all those

2988
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:44,000
things that needed to be uh in the

2989
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,040
researchy way um and obviously there

2990
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:48,880
could be one new research group that we

2991
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:51,840
can kick in um to do all the multiple

2992
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:53,760
thing or we can actually pin it to the

2993
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:56,639
existing ones that's basically some

2994
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:58,800
discussion that we need to take right i

2995
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:00,800
see colin is there so it would be good

2996
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:04,480
to have his convert session as well uh

2997
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:07,280
colin i'll

2998
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:08,719
i'll i would like to listen what do you

2999
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:10,960
think

3000
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:14,080
i mean as you say that's a conversation

3001
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:16,320
we need to have um

3002
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:18,239
uh i mean that there are certainly a

3003
01:55:18,239 --> 01:55:20,320
bunch of interesting research questions

3004
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:21,520
around multi

3005
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:22,639
path

3006
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:25,760
uh and some of them clearly fall into

3007
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:26,639
this

3008
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:28,960
the the the purview of this group some

3009
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:30,880
of them may fall into the congestion

3010
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:34,000
control side and fit into iccrg some of

3011
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,320
them may fit somewhere else and

3012
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,960
you know like um many of the topics

3013
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:39,760
we're

3014
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:42,000
hearing about they they scatter across a

3015
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,560
bunch of groups and

3016
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:47,599
you know i i tend to prefer broad groups

3017
01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:48,480
uh

3018
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:50,560
you know what and just accept the if

3019
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:52,159
things fit in a couple of groups but

3020
01:55:52,159 --> 01:55:53,840
rather than hyper specializing and how

3021
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:55,599
well you know let's not have a hyper

3022
01:55:55,599 --> 01:55:57,360
specialist multi-path

3023
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:58,960
group unless we're really sure we need

3024
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:00,400
it you know let's talk about it in the

3025
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:04,559
existing venues where it seems to fit in

3026
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:05,520
yeah

3027
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:07,599
otherwise we end up with a massive a

3028
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:10,239
massive little silos

3029
01:56:10,239 --> 01:56:12,320
that's the right approach

3030
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:14,800
but better for um

3031
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:16,960
percolation of ideas if we have slightly

3032
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:18,560
bigger groups covering

3033
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:20,480
these topics

3034
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:22,800
so so i would i would ask

3035
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:24,239
a bit of a question

3036
01:56:24,239 --> 01:56:25,119
here

3037
01:56:25,119 --> 01:56:28,119
um

3038
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:30,639
like i think there's two places where we

3039
01:56:30,639 --> 01:56:32,480
have sort of the right people paying

3040
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:33,520
attention to the problems that we're

3041
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:36,080
going to run into in in multi-path that

3042
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:38,080
are our protocol

3043
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:39,119
um

3044
01:56:39,119 --> 01:56:40,960
uh protocol general

3045
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:42,880
uh one is

3046
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:44,400
uh

3047
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:46,000
here because we're thinking about the

3048
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,679
path properties that are useful with the

3049
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:49,440
understanding that

3050
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:50,480
for

3051
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:52,320
um a lot of these scheduling protocols

3052
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:54,320
for the next n years

3053
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:55,920
much of what you're going to get back is

3054
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:58,000
going to be sensed as opposed to

3055
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,400
actually communicated to the network

3056
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:01,920
um you know even if we were wildly

3057
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:04,000
successful in saying okay here's the new

3058
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,080
here's the new multi-path pathway or

3059
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:07,199
internet architecture that we're going

3060
01:57:07,199 --> 01:57:08,880
to move to it you know the deployment

3061
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,000
curve but you still need to have this

3062
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:11,280
period of time where these properties

3063
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:12,480
need to be sensed

3064
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:14,960
uh the other one is iccrg

3065
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:16,560
um

3066
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:17,440
the

3067
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:20,320
uh so like i i i

3068
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:21,520
i think there's probably a conversation

3069
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:22,639
we should take offline as opposed to

3070
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:24,800
have at the open mic because i you know

3071
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:26,400
this has started a lot of conversation

3072
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:27,599
we have a bunch of people in the queue

3073
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:29,440
three minutes before we go but i think

3074
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:30,480
we should

3075
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:32,080
probably take this to the list and then

3076
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:34,719
also among the chairs of those groups

3077
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:38,800
uh and the ads have a discussion about

3078
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,960
you know what the right thing to say is

3079
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:42,320
i mean people are going to bring drafts

3080
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:43,280
to

3081
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:46,559
anywhere anyway right so

3082
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:49,599
yeah i mean there's going to be a bunch

3083
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:51,360
of drafts coming coming all over the

3084
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:54,159
place and um you know it's a reasonably

3085
01:57:54,159 --> 01:57:56,000
big problem space and and it certainly

3086
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,080
overlaps with several groups we have all

3087
01:57:58,080 --> 01:57:59,599
radiated overlaps with things in the

3088
01:57:59,599 --> 01:58:02,800
ietf so yeah we need to discuss it i

3089
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:03,760
don't think there's going to be one

3090
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:07,020
single home for all this work

3091
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:08,320
[Music]

3092
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:09,360
good good

3093
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:12,360
spencer

3094
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:16,400
so uh

3095
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:18,719
i i

3096
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:20,000
have

3097
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,560
in a private

3098
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:23,840
email

3099
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:25,040
conversation

3100
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:27,360
about things that i've said uh

3101
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:31,040
out loud uh so

3102
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:32,719
one of the things yeah one of the things

3103
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:35,520
with the multipath quick uh

3104
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,920
with multipath quick is that they're

3105
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:39,599
using uh

3106
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:41,199
whatever quick

3107
01:58:41,199 --> 01:58:42,719
does for

3108
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:44,000
one path

3109
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,560
congestion control

3110
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:48,880
right so the congestion control is path

3111
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:51,520
by path so please make the congestion

3112
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:54,719
control as awesome as you can make it

3113
01:58:54,719 --> 01:58:57,199
but that that doesn't the way that the

3114
01:58:57,199 --> 01:59:00,080
way that multipath quick is using

3115
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:02,639
has that doesn't that you know that

3116
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:04,320
doesn't impact

3117
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:05,040
uh

3118
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:07,360
whether you're multi-path or not so

3119
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:09,280
they're they they they they're gonna

3120
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,360
have a lot of work to do to support

3121
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,440
multi-path

3122
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:16,159
just making the individual paths work

3123
01:59:16,159 --> 01:59:17,440
awesomely

3124
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:20,320
uh with that um

3125
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:22,960
so you know uh the other you know

3126
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:25,679
another conversation that we did have

3127
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:26,560
during

3128
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:30,080
psv area was just the thing about uh

3129
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:32,480
the different multi-path groups or

3130
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:35,040
solving some of the same problems like

3131
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:36,639
how do you detect you know how do you

3132
01:59:36,639 --> 01:59:38,960
detect failures and things like that

3133
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:41,920
and that that is you know

3134
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:43,920
you can solve that protocol by protocol

3135
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:46,159
but you know you don't have to and

3136
01:59:46,159 --> 01:59:48,719
that's what that's what uh martin was

3137
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:50,719
saying at the mic that

3138
01:59:50,719 --> 01:59:52,800
uh he was

3139
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:55,440
interested in figuring out

3140
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:57,199
uh so that's probably that's probably

3141
01:59:57,199 --> 01:59:59,520
the last thing he said before

3142
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:00,400
the

3143
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:04,400
private conversation starts but

3144
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:07,520
the thing on our list about

3145
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:10,560
a general venue for ietf adjacent work

3146
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:12,719
on the intersection between

3147
02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:14,800
routing and transport

3148
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:17,360
i think that that's been a thing that

3149
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:19,679
we've worked at

3150
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:22,000
uh

3151
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:24,400
one of the things one of the things was

3152
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:27,119
we stopped scheduling uh penargy

3153
02:00:27,119 --> 02:00:29,280
opposite like the routing area

3154
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:31,280
but you know so i mean you know there

3155
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:32,639
are things that we've gotten smarter

3156
02:00:32,639 --> 02:00:35,040
about but my question uh

3157
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:36,800
is maybe more

3158
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:38,719
about uh

3159
02:00:38,719 --> 02:00:41,760
if we know that where there is a iatf

3160
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:43,199
adjacent

3161
02:00:43,199 --> 02:00:45,840
venue for ietf aj's at work on the

3162
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:47,760
intersection between

3163
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:50,639
transport and applications

3164
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:52,480
because that was a lot of what i was

3165
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:54,159
getting out of the media over quick

3166
02:00:54,159 --> 02:00:55,599
discussions

3167
02:00:55,599 --> 02:00:57,440
which i will not

3168
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:59,520
i will not summarize but i will point

3169
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:01,040
people in the direction of that mailing

3170
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:04,800
list and say stand back

3171
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:09,839
and thank you

3172
02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:17,679
thank you spencer sabina

3173
02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:21,400
has the last word

3174
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:26,719
um yes i wanted to

3175
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:28,560
just uh remark to

3176
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:32,080
get back on brian's uh consideration on

3177
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:35,280
uh when he was answered to tanji

3178
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:36,480
uh

3179
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:37,360
so

3180
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:40,960
and he was you you were saying well it's

3181
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:43,119
okay you can know uh which

3182
02:01:43,119 --> 02:01:45,920
path you can access with your phone

3183
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:49,360
uh but you have no clue whether you

3184
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:53,280
there is a satellite link uh between um

3185
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:55,119
between the two endpoints

3186
02:01:55,119 --> 02:01:57,199
and i just wanted to uh

3187
02:01:57,199 --> 02:01:58,960
point to to uh

3188
02:01:58,960 --> 02:01:59,760
the

3189
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:02,719
draft a working group draft that is

3190
02:02:02,719 --> 02:02:05,679
under iesg review in the auto working

3191
02:02:05,679 --> 02:02:06,560
group

3192
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:09,679
and this precisely talks about

3193
02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:10,560
a

3194
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:12,960
protocol extension that would

3195
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:14,320
convey

3196
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:15,199
some

3197
02:02:15,199 --> 02:02:18,880
abstracted information on elements

3198
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:21,599
that would uh sit between

3199
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:24,960
the two endpoints of a application path

3200
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:27,599
and that could give you a clue

3201
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:29,040
that could give

3202
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:32,719
the application a clue of whether

3203
02:02:32,719 --> 02:02:33,599
this

3204
02:02:33,599 --> 02:02:34,560
would be

3205
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:37,840
good or not or how in which extent this

3206
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:38,800
can

3207
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:41,199
uh impact the performance of the

3208
02:02:41,199 --> 02:02:44,320
application and this work may be

3209
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:50,480
useful uh to read uh for the panarji uh

3210
