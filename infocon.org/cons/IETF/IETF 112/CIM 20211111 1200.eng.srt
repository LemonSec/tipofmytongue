we will be following the iatc ietf

51
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,239
privacy

52
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,120
processes as well as the ietf processes

53
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,920
sorry um i'm not going to read them

54
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,840

55
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,239
be considered

56
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,000
okay

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,799
uh some meeting tips uh please stay

58
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,360
muted it is recommended although for me

59
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,840
the headset doesn't work

60
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,920
we usually track attendance through the

61
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,400
blue sheet but now that we're meeting

62
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,680
virtually

63
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,560
um

64
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,799
it's being tracked automatically

65
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,280
there are chat rooms and the meet echo

66
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,920
some of you are already on there

67
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,799
and if you need further assistance there

68
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,640
are a couple of links there to help you

69
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,959
the other thing that was noted um that

70
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,799
we should highlight is the code of

71
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,000
conduct

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,439
so a reminder of some of those points

73
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,560
here

74
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,159
is that um as we participate we should

75
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,360
extend

76
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,599
um respect and courtesy

77
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,400
we all bring in different perspectives

78
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,879
we are a diverse group so just be

79
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,639
respectful of that

80
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,160
keep our discussions professional um

81
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,960
and uh to stay on point

82
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,400
all right so with that in mind

83
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,199
uh thank you pam again for being our our

84
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,960
jabber we definitely could use a second

85
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,479
or third one um it is a live note set of

86
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,680
notes so

87
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,720
i encourage everyone to help um

88
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,080
especially as pam will be presenting um

89
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,800
on the third slot

90
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,759
so

91
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,120
with that

92
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,800
i want to get to the first order of

93
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,720

94
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,280

95
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,120

96
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,440

97

100
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,320

101
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,639
um so

102
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,840
i'll i'm just gonna spend a few minutes

103
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,360
to remind everyone of what we said we

104
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,160
would do in the charter the milestones

105
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,210
are there to be

106
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,120
[Music]

107
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,240
as markers and we can update as we go

108
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,639
along um

109
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,960
but getting to the agenda so first step

110
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,440
we've got janelle and danny to help

111
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,320
provide an introduction of

112
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,120
what we did in the first

113
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,600
when skin first chartered and why we

114
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,320
rechartered meaning they'll go through

115
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,639
the current original rfcs with

116
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,800
highlights of

117
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,639
the new work that we may want to tackle

118
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,680
there

119
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,000
that will then be followed by

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,319
pam who'll cover the

121
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,400
the use cases and concepts that we want

122
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
to focus on

123
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,759
now

124
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,919
based on the rechartering

125
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,720
i am hoping phil will join i don't see

126
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,160
him here

127
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,880
but he is um

128
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,479
on the dock here to present um his

129
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,880
current draft on uh

130
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,440
on multi-value filtering and then danny

131
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,240
will be talking about a couple of

132
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,720
of proposals that he put together in

133
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,520
ietf drafts um that go to the skip

134
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,240
extensions and then at the end i just

135
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,960
wanted to cover our next steps and the

136
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,880
types of tools that we may want to use

137
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,560
i've got a proposal

138
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,840
um that i'll put up a couple of polls

139
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,759
for how we want to proceed

140
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,680
and that kind of brings us to the end of

141
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,759
the session so

142
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,360
with that in mind

143
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,960
any comments or feedback

144
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,440
going once going twice

145
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,000
if not okay i'm already one minute

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,680
behind so

147
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,400
i know this is an eye chart um but i did

148
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,080
put in the link

149
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,680
to our

150
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,960
tour actually to our actual charter

151
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,840
but again just to recap um what we

152
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,360
agreed to do was to revisit

153
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,840
and review and augment to the use cases

154
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
that will help drive

155
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,000
the work that we need to do vis-a-vis

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,639
updating both the schema and the

157
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,080
protocol

158
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,319
rfcs

159
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,599
followed by

160
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,240
some of the other extensions so again

161
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,440
i'm not going to read through the

162
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,479
charter

163
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,880
this is just to provide you

164
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,840
that high level um

165
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,479
overview

166
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,520
i saw somebody come up on video so

167
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,360
if you want to get on the queue then i

168
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,120
suspect um

169
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,639
i would like for you to come in and um

170
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,639
sorry i'm not awake yet

171
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,120
to put yourself on the queue um through

172
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,560
the participants

173
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,599
you don't need to turn your video on

174
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,400
okay so with that um being said what we

175
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,599
also

176
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,759
provided was

177
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,879
just a stake in the ground for the kinds

178
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,080
of

179
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,879
documents that we may want to do besides

180
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,440
the revisions to the base schema and

181
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,720
protocol

182
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,680
and we just laid out some what i'm

183
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,399
calling markers or milestones

184
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,599
of

185
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,919
rough targets of where we want to be

186
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,760
that doesn't mean that

187
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,399
this is the final thing it is up to the

188
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,880
working group for us to decide how we

189
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,480
want to break the work

190
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,600
um

191
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,920
and move forward on things

192
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,279
so

193
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,560
okay

194
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,880
that being said i left myself with a

195
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,800
minute for questions

196
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,560
or comments

197
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,240
if not

198
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,399
i know we have a full um

199
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,000
full agenda so if not what we can do is

200
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,240
move forward

201
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,040
to

202
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,360
the intro

203
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,920
and we can have

204
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,440
janelle so janelle i figured and danny

205
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,760
i could run the slides for you unless

206
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,080
you want to but i just

207
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,839

for danny and i to take it away

211
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,680
okay please go welcome everybody uh i'm

212

janelle allen and uh i'd also like to

213
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,640
introduce you to danny zulner

214
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,480
we both have something in common we are

215
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,279
product managers uh for

216
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,160
for

217
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,040
danny's at microsoft and i'm at cisco

218
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,000
anyway

219
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
nancy could you uh

220
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,760
flip to the next slide please

221
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,800
um we just like to start with what is

222
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,320
skim you know this standard has come

223
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,120
about over the last 10 years i think

224
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
yeah when did it get

225
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,920
uh

226
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,240
released danny the the rfc do you

227
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,519
remember

228
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,959
um

229
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,959
but

230
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,640
danny

231
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,360
uh

232
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,839
okay uh about 2015 i believe

233
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,480
yeah 2015. and so it's been it's been

234
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,320
around for a while and really what was

235
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,560
it designed to do it was designed for

236
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,800
sharing identity data across contexts

237
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,000
and it really

238
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,040
uh was normalizing this data you know

239
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
normalizing maybe is a tricky word to

240
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,920
use um but it was abstracting away this

241
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,079
data from its existing where it was

242
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,560
residing in its data source to be to be

243
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,440
shared between um different you know

244
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,240
different

245
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,880
organizations identity context domains

246
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,839
is what we call it in the standard

247
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,720
it consists of a communication protocol

248
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,000
and the core schema and this you know it

249
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,240
allows for extensibility

250
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,360
it wasn't

251
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,600
you know a net new standard it was

252
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,760
building upon a lot of

253
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,480
work that had come before us in in

254
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,560
previous waves of deploying and handling

255
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,160
identity data

256
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,399
and uh it was designed to be fast and

257
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,320
cheap and easy to to use

258
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,760
nancy next slide please

259
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,120
so

260
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,279
again why skim

261
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:47,920
it

262
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,839
it abstracts away this underlying data

263
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,720
structure um if the data is stored in a

264
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,519
database such as sql or

265
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,680
in in a directory such as about app

266
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,720
directory or ad or elsewhere um you know

267
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
it takes away the notion of of that

268
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,880
specific data storage mechanism and it

269
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,600
it abstracts that away

270
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,320
and it treats every site the same and

271
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,160
that enables scale

272
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,440
and it's very helpful in that way

273
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,800
nancy next slide please

274
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,880
to show you an example

275
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,800
just at a very very um conceptual level

276
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,959
we have an example of

277
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,720
an identity here

278
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,639
her name is jane smith

279
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,519
and

280
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,480
her data is stored in a database we

281
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,639
don't go into great details of the

282
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,519
databases as a suggestion um the format

283
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,959
of that data might be stored with the

284
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,079
last

285
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,519
you know last underscore name jane smith

286
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,680
but uh this example is showing that

287
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,880
there's a there's a service a skim

288
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,360
service that's sharing that data

289
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,760
um you know to an app that's running in

290
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,120
the cloud

291
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,680
you know somewhere and that that app

292
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,560
wants to store that same user in a

293
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,560
different data structure in the data

294
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,079
structure being suggested here as a

295
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,760
directory structure

296
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,160
and we can see that the

297
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,760
the skim service

298
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
transforms the data from its original

299
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,200
data store

300
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,240
into

301
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,040
this

302
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,639
standardized json format that skim

303
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,320
takes the data through

304
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,360
and then

305
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,040
the client can decide how to interpret

306
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,480
that data and then store it on the other

307
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,720
side

308
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,000
next slide please

309
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,440
the skim protocol

310
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,880
r is defined in rfc 7644

311
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,160
and it had a restful approach in design

312
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,120
and it's a set of apis they follow you

313
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,680
know they use the http methods you know

314
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,519
the verbs for get

315
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,160
post push patch and delete which is very

316
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,320
convenient for identity data which

317
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,399
follows you know the create

318
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,760
read

319
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,160
update and delete methods so we can map

320
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,680
those quite easily to these http methods

321
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,639
and

322
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,600
you know we can standard uh send the the

323
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,000
standard skim json payloads to the

324
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,279
resource endpoints which can be users

325
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,839
groups as defined in the standard and

326
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,120
other resources which are definable by

327
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,519
the standard

328
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,519
it standardizes these methods for

329
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,959
communication

330
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,600
with the servers in skim these servers

331
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,760
are called service providers and a

332
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,920
service what is a service provider in in

333
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,760
the sensuality

334
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,320
it's an hdb server which exposes

335
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,560
standard cm apis for

336
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,279
for the traditional

337
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,000
create read update bleed operations uh

338
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,880
for skin claim

339
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,880
um all of the endpoints provide well

340
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,639
there are three endpoints i should say

341
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,360
that provide discoverability for for

342
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,320
understanding how to to interact with

343
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,120
the server or the skim

344
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,680
providers

345
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,720
and danny will take over the next slides

346
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,440
uh hi uh

347
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,160
so yeah we wanted to go over uh just

348
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,560
what are the the standard endpoints

349
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,839
included in the uh the original skim 2.0

350
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:22,880
spec

351
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,120
uh so up at the top of the list we've

352
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,600
got slash users and slash groups uh

353
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
those represent shockingly users and

354
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,680
groups uh which are you know mainstays

355
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
of uh identity really regardless of how

356
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,160
your you know where the identity data is

357
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,440
uh stored

358
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
uh those endpoints allow for sort of the

359
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,639
full gamut of the rest verbs get post

360
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,880
put patch and delete

361
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,320
um

362
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,160
and

363
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,360
uh both i guess uh users and groups they

364
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,880
come with a core set of attributes uh

365
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
and then uh the

366
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,560
users also have

367
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,920
uh in their schema there is an

368
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,639
enterprise uh schema that is uh you know

369
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,680
an extension of a couple extra

370
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,920
attributes that is included

371
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,199
uh in the the game 2.0 standard

372
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,880
uh groups

373
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,160
has a

374
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,360
simpler

375
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,079
schema compared to users uh the only

376
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,480
group specific attributes uh that aren't

377
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,000
part of a common pool would be uh

378
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,639
display name and members uh but part of

379
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,040
our charter is to uh look into that and

380
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,720
make it uh expanded

381
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,800
uh there's next uh on the list we have

382
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,480
uh slash me

383
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,880
uh slash me is a method to find the

384
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,560
standard to allow

385
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,600
uh an authenticated uh user to

386
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,639
read

387
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,720
uh data about themselves or interact

388
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,480
with themselves so you know examples

389
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,759
being uh maybe uh you've got some an

390
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,120
internal application and it's going to

391
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,959
update uh it's gonna allow the user to

392
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,800
update their password using the skim

393
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,959
standard uh so they can send a post or a

394
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,440
patch or whatnot to

395
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,800
uh well find out a post because how are

396
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,279
you gonna create yourself but um

397
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,440
uh it allows them to you know manipulate

398
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,199
themselves specifically

399
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,039
um next on the list we have three that

400
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,119
all have that check mark next to them uh

401
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,839
and these are what we refer to as the

402
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,359
discovery endpoints

403
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,199
uh so slash schemas allows you to

404
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,199
retrieve available schemas

405
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,559
and the themes are just you know

406
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,799
representations of a set of available

407
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,160
attributes for a resource type so uh the

408
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,640
user's resource has two schemas the core

409
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,440
and the enterprise groups just has core

410
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,320
um

411
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,360
and you know it's very extensible

412
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,559
um

413
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,880
moving on to the next one uh resource

414
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,840
types uh that's a way to discover what

415
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,720
resources are available so um in in the

416
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,320
you know the core standard

417
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,160
implementation resource types would

418
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,559
return uh users and groups

419
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,480
uh and then

420
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,559
uh servicewriter config allows you to

421
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,440
read uh configuration details

422
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,080
uh specific to that skim server or

423
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,840
service provider

424
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,919
such as you know it is such and such

425
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,840
feature enabled and if it is you know

426
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,679
what are the parameters of it

427
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,960
um so there's a handful of uh

428
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,679
of like configuration options in defined

429
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,360
in the core schema

430
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,760
but some of the uh draft extensions that

431
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,240
have been written also they all propose

432
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,320
using servicewriter config to advertise

433
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,000
whether or not they are implemented on

434
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,880
the service provider

435
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,960
and

436
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,280
down at the bottom list we have uh two

437
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,480
that are

438
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,760
um

439
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,919
i think a little less frequently

440
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,320
implemented but i i've seen instances of

441
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,440
both i believe

442
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,919
um bulk especially so there's uh dot

443
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:40,799
search

444
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,200
uh which uh

445
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
you would uh it's essentially an

446
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,360
alternative to the http uh getrest

447
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,320
method

448
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,799
um it allows you to define a query uh

449
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,880
and you submit that career using post in

450
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,240
order to serious uh set of results and

451
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,039
then

452
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,760
uh the bulk endpoint uh you'll submit

453
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,000
your request using a post and inside of

454
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,960
the body of that request will be uh one

455
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,160
or more

456
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,880
uh separated sets of actions so you'll

457
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,400
include not only the resource that

458
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,280
you're that you're hitting but also the

459
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,480
uh

460
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,640
the rest method and the body of that

461
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,360
request so it allows you um to sort of

462
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,200
scale and hit efficiency more easily

463
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,600
because you can submit uh you know 20 or

464
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,039
100 or higher uh amounts of

465
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,280
uh accommodation of get post patch foot

466
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,799
delete

467
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,720
um so danny and janelle i don't know if

468
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,320
you're taking questions in the middle

469
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,960
but phil hunt is in the queue

470
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,840
you might have a comment

471
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,240
help

472
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,480
phil you're in the queue

473
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,600
did you have a comment or question

474
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,520
the size microphone thing light up

475
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,720
okay

476
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,159
just keep going daniel i'll ping phil

477
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,880
okay um

478
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,400
yeah he's having my problems uh next

479
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,640
slide please

480
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,360
and then uh on this page we have uh a

481
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,200
not exhaustive

482
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,000
uh

483
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,919
okay uh so phil had a comment uh the

484
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,159
post on dot search is for security

485
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,039
because a get query can reveal pii

486
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,520
okay uh so yeah i i did not have the

487
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,720
context on that so it was very much

488
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,240
appreciated uh

489
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,919
and to expand on that we could actually

490
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,080
use uh what we have right here on on

491
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,240
this slide to go into the details of

492
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,799
that so um on this slide we have a set

493
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,039
of uh examples uh not exhaustive

494
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,080
obviously

495
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,559
of uh things that can be done with the

496
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,159
skim protocol

497
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,720
uh so the third example we'll just jump

498
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,200
straight to that uh in the resource url

499
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,960
so https

500
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,280
you know whatever slash users

501
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,799
filter equals

502
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,320
uh

503
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,919
you can see there we're saying users

504
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,960
filter equals username equals user

505
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,480
domain.com and so the dot search uh

506
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,919
option allows

507
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,720
to perform a search without uh having

508
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,919
sort of a plain text url with pii in it

509
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,520
uh

510
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,600
so now rewinding a little bit we'll just

511
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,280
talk to some of the other ones

512
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,240
uh so a post against slash users will

513
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,080
let you create a new resource and this

514
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,760
is you know all the i'm using users as

515
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,120
the examples for all of these but this

516
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,960
scales out to any uh data resource

517
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,240
representing objects that can be

518
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,600
manipulated

519
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,159
uh so if you send a post with a body

520
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,760
containing adequate information to slash

521
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,919
users slash groups uh you know flash

522
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:48,880
anything

523
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,720
uh assuming it's been implemented uh in

524
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,440
this in the the relevant skim server uh

525
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,360
you should be able to create a resource

526
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,840
uh get against the the root resource

527
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,440
like slash users will return all

528
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,960
resources

529
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,760
uh then the third example you can define

530
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,600
attribute based filters

531
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,000
um they can be fairly simple like this

532
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,880
or they can be uh multiple sets in

533
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,200
parentheses uh you know you have a full

534
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,440
set of operators and or

535
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,720
um

536
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,360
so uh you you can only return users

537
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,840
where department equals sales or

538
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,760
uh you know it matches they match a

539
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,840
specific

540
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,120
username uh and then

541
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,360
we also have another method of

542
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,799
retrieving a user that doesn't use a

543
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,039
filter uh which is the fourth line and

544
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,520
i'll just be getting them using uh

545
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,480
their

546
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,320
id value which is a sort of a core

547
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,960
component of skim and that will return

548
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,679
just the resource matching that id value

549
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,679
and the standard states that id needs to

550
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,640
be unique across all resources

551
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,240
um

552
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,400
next two are two different methods to

553
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,159
update objects uh so if you do a put on

554
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,880
a on a resource uh you will define the

555
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,120
full set of attribute values that uh

556
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,559
that it has

557
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,799
and if you omit anything uh it is

558
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,600
expected that the the attributes that

559
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,159
have been omitted will be set to null or

560
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,440
you know blank

561
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,559
uh and then patch allows you to do a

562
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,240
selective uh

563
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,480
set of modifications without clobbering

564
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,320
all the other things so if you send up a

565
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,880
patch for user and only modify active

566
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,039
from true to false you're leaving all

567
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,880
the other information away are alone

568
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,360
rather and not modifying it

569
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,880
um

570
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,520
another option for updating

571
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,679
you can actually use filters to

572
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,840
select a group of objects

573
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,720
or resources and update all of them

574
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,320
uh based you know anything that comes

575
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,520
back on the filter will get the same

576
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,840
update applied so if you need to change

577
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,440
the name of the department you know

578
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,919
sales gets turned into you know the

579
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,200
organizational rebranding or whatever

580
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,559
you can do that

581
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,559
you know at scale pretty easily

582
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,480
and then delete

583
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,080
self-explanatory allows you to delete

584
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,080
the resource

585
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,559
next slide please

586
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,880
uh so now to talk about the schema a

587
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,840
little more so the schema defines a

588
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,360
minimal common set of attributes that

589
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,960
represent the user in group data along

590
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,720
with the enterprise extension we talked

591
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,039
about this uh it's also very extensible

592
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,240
uh so you can extend schemas uh you can

593
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,720
you know add existing uh or you can add

594
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,880
attributes to existing resource types uh

595
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,440
you know users groups uh but you can

596
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,320
also extend resource types uh so if the

597
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,760
content you know if the the concepts of

598
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,279
users and groups aren't adequate for the

599
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,640
usage situation

600
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,480
uh your service provider can implement

601
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,880
others and they can be advertised uh

602
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,279
with that slash resource types endpoint

603
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,440
uh that we discussed a few slides ago

604
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,799
um so it may be slash contacts slash uh

605
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,360
you know uh conference rooms

606
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,200
but the sky's the limit essentially

607
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,159
uh and then uh the skin standard uh says

608
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,840
that custom schemas may be permanently

609
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,520
registered with ayanna

610
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
um from our

611
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,039
research we're not actually sure if

612
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,720
anybody has done this yet although there

613
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,120
are plenty of custom schemas out there

614
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,240
um

615
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,919
so far the the only ones that we were

616
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,480
able to notice there uh were the ones

617
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,440
directly assigned to the the standard

618
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,559
uh next slide please

619
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,279
uh and so now we wanted to take uh sort

620
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,679
of a little snippet of the

621
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,640
uh the rfe uh and show how it's

622
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,400
represented in the body of of an object

623
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,240
in in skim format

624
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,200
uh so the the skim uh schema rfc which

625
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,880
is 7643

626
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,919
uh has two different spots where it uh

627
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,320
describes attributes uh the first

628
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,559
section which is uh it's either in the

629
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,360
in the section three or four uh sorry i

630
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,279
can't remember uh

631
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,679
is more a more descriptive manner of

632
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:52,880
talking about attributes and that's what

633
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,240
we see on the left

634
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,200
um and so it um it's a short set of you

635
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,720
know one or two sentences per attribute

636
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,559
sometimes longer talking about the

637
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,080
properties that it has

638
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,880
um

639
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,679
and then down in i believe it's section

640
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,840
eight there's uh

641
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,520
a full json representation of the schema

642
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,919
uh that's shown and that gives you uh

643
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,840
all of the the nitty gritty uh the

644
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,000
mutability state is it read uh is it

645
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,080
read only is it read write uh is it

646
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,640
multi-valued what's the data type uh all

647
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,120
those things um

648
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,919
and

649
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,440
in the current standard there's been a

650
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,200
couple

651
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,159
uh

652
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,679
there's been a couple instances where uh

653
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,760
some confusion gets drawn between

654
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,400
the the two sections uh the like sort of

655
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,799
uh expository description

656
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,320
part versus the

657
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,159
the json representation

658
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,159
uh but and that's something we're hoping

659
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,400
to touch on moving forward

660
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,240
uh but on this slide

661
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,200
uh we can see uh name is described as a

662
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,039
single value complex attribute it's the

663
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,880
components of a user's name

664
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,039
and then if we look over on the right in

665
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,279
that section of name

666
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,919
we can see its name and then the

667
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,760
squiggly brackets

668
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,559
which are indicative that it's a complex

669
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,640
attribute and a complex attribute is

670
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,039
then made up of uh one or more

671
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,799
uh simple valid attributes so that could

672
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,919
be you know string integer uh what not

673
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,120
uh boolean

674
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,200
uh so name has

675
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,840
several sub-attributes formatted family

676
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
name given name

677
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,399
um and then you know phone numbers is

678
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,640
similar except it's a multi-valued

679
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,039
complex attribute and

680
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,679
we can tell that because it's the the

681
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,919
square brackets and then

682
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,919
uh it'll be one or more sets of squiggly

683
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,000
brackets uh each set of squiggly

684
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,679
brackets uh

685
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,880
enclosing a single like complex

686
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,720
result or object uh

687
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,399
of that value i guess a complex value

688
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,679
would be the right word

689
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,480
and uh yeah we can see phone numbers uh

690
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
in this representation has value and

691
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,240
type uh i

692
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,679
believe there's one or two other uh

693
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,200
sub-attributes as well

694
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,799
uh and same thing for emails uh it's

695
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,760
multi-valued complex so it's an array

696
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,159
of one or more complex uh

697
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,520
values uh typically with uh

698
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,320
the

699
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,840
the type value is used to differentiate

700
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,360
between uh different

701
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,200
purposes for email because if you have

702
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,799
more than one email it may be that uh

703
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,960
you know one is a personal email or a

704
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,480
secondary versus

705
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,320
uh you know a primary like work related

706
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,360
one

707
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,120
uh certain attributes in the schema such

708
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,399
as username

709
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,520
uh are

710
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,159
required uh id is also required

711
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,159
um and then there's

712
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,399
in whenever uh results are recreated

713
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,320
from a server uh there are also some

714
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,240
attributes that are returned back that

715
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,320
are read-only so there there's this

716
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,480
whole uh complex uh meta attribute with

717
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,120
some metadata about the object

718
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,640
um

719
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,039
[Music]

720
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,600
and then uh you can see up at the top uh

721
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,399
the

722
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,840
schemas returned tells what schemas are

723
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,559
being uh used for this object so you can

724
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,080
see in this example uh the core 2.0 user

725
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,880
schema and the extension enterprise 2.0

726
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,240
user uh which are you know the two

727
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,080
different user schemas in the

728
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,840
in the

729
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,120
standard uh next slide please

730
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,799
uh and here's just a quick list of the

731
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,919
data types

732
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,720
uh you got you know your old favorites

733
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,840
uh strings booleans decimal integer date

734
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,720
time

735
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,120
uh binary and then the the two that are

736
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,240
you know worth

737
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,919
talking about a little bit here are

738
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,960
reference and complex uh complex we just

739
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,840
uh saw a couple examples of uh again

740
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,480
it's just a collection of one or more

741
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,000
simple valued attributes grouped

742
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,960
together

743
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
um and then

744
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,880
reference is a

745
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,039
pointer

746
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,760
to a resource somewhere

747
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,360
so for example the standard defines uh a

748
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,279
an attribute for photos

749
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,679
for uh like a profile picture type

750
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,880
concept and uh a url will be included

751
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,360
you know https console whatever.jpg

752
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,679
and so the the reference attribute is a

753
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,279
reference to a uri pointing to a

754
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,600
resource

755
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,399
uh and with that uh next slide please

756
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,039
and back to janelle

757
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,559
skim has been widely successful it's

758
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,720
been widely adopted by many many

759
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,320
companies around the world

760
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,480
um it it's

761
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,720
why we are here is that there have been

762
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,520
some wrinkles in in skim

763
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,080
and we seek to address them and some of

764
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,200
these are related to usability um

765
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,480
sometimes the spec isn't 100 clear in

766
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,240
certain areas and this leads to some

767
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,360
interoperability challenges and then you

768
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,760
may have a client

769
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,520
side skim

770
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,720
client that

771
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,799
customer that's interacting with the

772
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,440
server and they come into

773
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,559
well

774
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,159
having arguments over how they're

775
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,159
implementing the spec and then they

776
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,880
realize that actually it's not clear

777
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,799
sometimes in the spec

778
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,880
there is limited guidance on certain

779
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,519
certain aspects such as groups and roles

780
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,679
how you handle entitlements

781
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,240
and some of the attributes are not

782
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,279
clearly defined in in 7643

783
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,679
so we seek to improve the usability of

784
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,080
the spec in general

785
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,120
we are looking to make improvements uh

786
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,640
some

787
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,120
uh some companies have noticed some

788
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,799
problems with the bulk operations and

789
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,320
and how they operate

790
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,679
pagination

791
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,000
uh has some limitations

792
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,360
some people would like to extend the

793
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,039
core schema

794
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,360
and then you know there are some new and

795
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,519
emerging concepts that happen in draft

796
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,760
that are actually in use in draft such

797
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,760
as limited uh privileged access

798
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,320
management we seek to

799
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,799
to move that from draft to standardize

800
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,960
and address whatever issues it has so

801
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,320
these are the types of papercuts the

802
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,559
paper cuts we have a link to and we

803
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,840
welcome other organizations to

804
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,320
share their experiences uh with skim as

805
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,120
well

806
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,480
and uh

807
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,320
and and show that with the working group

808
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,480
so we can address any other issues that

809
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,559
may not have been already documented in

810
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,480
the papercuts

811
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,640
nancy next slide

812
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,880
please

813
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,559
so what are our goals for the next

814
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,240
generation of skim

815
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,640
and really we seek to improve these

816
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,200
overall best practices and guidances and

817
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,600
clearing up the specification in areas

818
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,960
of ambiguity

819
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,840
um

820
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,120
there is

821
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,320
some notion of that had been in previous

822
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,720
drafts regarding soft delete and how to

823
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,240
handle that

824
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,840
in skim

825
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,240
as well and then also

826
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,440
looking to

827
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,640
enhance

828
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,120
the schema in certain areas for for data

829
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,000
that's handled by hr systems enterprise

830
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,159
group data as well as privileged access

831
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,720
management

832
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,640
advanced automation scenarios there are

833
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,000
several of those

834
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
that we could wax and lean on for quite

835
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,399
some time and then enhance data handling

836
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,760
for larger sets this could be the

837
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,960
pagination this could be other things

838
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,559
um

839
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,399
these are sub articles you can read the

840
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,080
full list in our charter of what we're

841
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,000
seeking to do

842
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,760
in the link below and answer shared as

843
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,360
well

844
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,880
thanks everybody

845
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,919
are there any questions

846
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,000
yeah you're doing great on time

847
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,960
well nancy it seems that uh

848
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,120
we can move on to the next

849
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,960
agenda person and then there'll be more

850
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,960
time and questions on

851
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,279
something meatier than the intro

852
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,760
how we can proceed well i mean at some

853
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,840
point um

854
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,559
the group will need to decide on the

855
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,960
content of how we want to go about

856
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,600
updating both the schema and the

857
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,440
protocol specs right

858
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,359
but in the meantime yes we can

859
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,000
move on to

860
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
pam

861
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,079
all right

862
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,679
kevin we've had some micro shoes

863
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,599
can you hear me

864
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,119
yes we

865
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,918
i can hear you fine i can see you fine

866
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,839
that's awesome

867
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,599
great and

868
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,599
i just shared your slides

869
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,879
perfect

870
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,599
um and you're willing to place a slide

871
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,440
adventure for me

872
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,719
of course

873
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,199
okay that's fantastic thank you for all

874
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,480
your work and we really appreciate it

875
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,960
hi everybody my name is pam dingle i

876
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,160
work for microsoft as well

877
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,880
i get to work with danny

878
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,599
and what we want to cover today is in

879
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,720
fact we want to dig more into rfc 7642

880
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,760
if you haven't heard of 7642

881
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,320
i wouldn't be terribly surprised if you

882
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,560
want to advance to the next

883
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,599
spec

884
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:20,720
so there are actually three

885
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,040
specifications that were published

886
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,480
as a family

887
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,280
um in that 2015 time frame

888
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,680
76 43 and 44 were the the core schema

889
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,280
and the core protocol

890
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,280
um this document 7642 is has the title

891
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,320
of definitions overview concepts and

892
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,520
requirements

893
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,200
uh so it's a non

894
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,880
you know to use what i think is the

895
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,599
right spec terms it's a non-normative

896
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,599
uh document it doesn't

897
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,040
um

898
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,800
exactly instruct you how to use how to

899
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,720
use things but it is meant

900
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,359
to you know the goal of it

901
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,520
as i understand it is for someone to be

902
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,760
able to read this and then have

903
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,880
an easier time understanding what to do

904
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,520
with uh the actual core specifications

905
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,240
does anyone want to add any color around

906
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,560
the creation of 7642 now i know we have

907
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,400
a few people who are there for the

908
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,280
actual process

909
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,760
it's too bad phil has make problems

910
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,839
because

911
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,000
uh i know right he was there from the

912
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
beginning yeah

913
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,960
yeah um so i guess that means that i can

914
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,599
um you know take his name in vain

915
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,880
for the next 30 minutes and there's

916
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,040
really nothing

917
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,079
okay don't put that in the scribing

918
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,920
all right so uh so what we want to do

919
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,520
today is just look at

920
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,000
what the fit for purpose um has been for

921
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,599
76.42

922
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,520
and

923
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,599
at the end of it my goal here is to ask

924
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,200
whether people have

925
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,400
interest

926
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,119
in

927
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,440
participating in an effort to revise

928
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,200
this document

929
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,800
so just keep that in mind as we speak

930
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,280
uh informational status sorry roman in

931
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,839
the chat added the official correct

932
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,079
terms um so it is an informational

933
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,960
status versus a proposed standard

934
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,680
which is what 76 43 and 44 are

935
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,480
okay great so let's

936
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,560
dig then into what what does 7642

937
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,240
talk about so one of the major things

938
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,440
that 7642 talks about is it tries to

939
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,200
um create

940
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,359
um the names of actors that have

941
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,000
relationships to each other in

942
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,880
um

943
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,119
in the skim specification or you know or

944
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,560
that could um com comprise use cases

945
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,880
that use the skim specification and so

946
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,960
they just describe three different

947
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,440
actors a cloud service provider

948
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,839
an enterprise cloud subscriber

949
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,040
and a cloud service user now this

950
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,440
of course is now slightly dated

951
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,800
terminology

952
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,680
in that um

953
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,920
you know the the

954
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,359
a lot of the implications in the

955
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,920
document are that enterprise cloud

956
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,240
subscribers always um

957
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,000
have certain patterns of usage and i

958
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,599
think those patterns of usage are

959
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,880
slightly

960
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,359
have proven you to not pass the test of

961
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,320
time

962
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,920
but essentially what you're seeing here

963
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,440
you know this sort of diagram that's

964
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,680
been provided is this idea of

965
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,680
a cloud service provider as essentially

966
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,560
a multi-tenant platform

967
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,520
with many ecs's or enterprise cloud

968
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,320
subscribers of subscribing and then

969
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,000
in turn those enterprise cloud

970
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,440
subscribers have

971
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,680
um users attached

972
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,440
now

973
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,480
the interesting thing about this is that

974
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,720
um

975
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,200
that you know there is no exact

976
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,720
correlation here

977
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,760
to a subscriber versus a provider

978
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,599
in the actual 76 43 and 44 language so

979
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,400
the word subscriber is not a term

980
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,720
in the protocol at all as far as i know

981
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,800
it's certainly not in the definitions

982
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,599
in

983
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,800
rfc 7643 and so there's some confusion

984
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,720
and ambiguity here now the other thing

985
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,440
is that the cloud service provider

986
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,160
the term service provider is in fact an

987
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,440
important term

988
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,240
in 7643

989
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,480
but as you'll see as we go on there are

990
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,079
times when cloud service providers talk

991
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,240
to cloud service providers and in that

992
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,560
case the term service provider has zero

993
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,040
protocol specific meaning and so we have

994
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,760
a

995
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,079
we have a collision in terms just in the

996
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,280
basic

997
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,560
terminology that's used in 7642

998
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,240
let's keep going if you want to advance

999
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,520
this

1000
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,240
um so here's where the real

1001
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,560
confusion comes in so the you know we

1002
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,800
define in 7642

1003
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,599
triggers modes and use cases so the

1004
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,599
triggers um

1005
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,599
are sort of the major

1006
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,440
obvious triggers that would happen in a

1007
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,720
restful

1008
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,319
um

1009
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,160
a restful service endpoint right

1010
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,200
creation

1011
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,880
update deletion and then there's a

1012
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,960
trigger called single sign-on

1013
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,560
which is an interesting one so it's

1014
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,680
really meant

1015
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,079
i think to talk about just-in-time

1016
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,359
use cases

1017
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,160
but

1018
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,079
the interesting thing nowadays is that

1019
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,000
just-in-time use cases occur

1020
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,400
for reasons other than just sso they

1021
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,079
occur for things like

1022
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,720
privilege elevation for example and so

1023
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,280
that term is slightly outdated now as

1024
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,839
well it was perfectly fine in the day

1025
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,760
at least in in my opinion and by the way

1026
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,119
i'm making

1027
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,960
um

1028
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,280
what might be provocative statements

1029
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,040
in the hopes that

1030
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,000
you

1031
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,400
care to to correct me so

1032
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,160
um you know if you feel like i'm being

1033
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,560
overblown here i would love to hear it

1034
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,400
and i you know i'm doing so kind of on

1035
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,839
purpose

1036
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:54,560
to

1037
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,640
to see if i can enrage you all enough to

1038
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,079
come join me in

1039
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,839
making this work so

1040
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,839
so you can see the use cases uh in the

1041
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,680
document for example we have a ton of

1042
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,760
these cloud service provider to cloud

1043
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,200
service provider

1044
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,599
interactions

1045
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,359
that's perfectly fine we certainly have

1046
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,040
cloud service provider interactions

1047
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,920
today in 2021

1048
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,000
however what the document doesn't do

1049
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,960
today

1050
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,920
is translate the use case of a cloud

1051
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,920
service provider trying to

1052
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,480
um create an identity at another cloud

1053
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,640
service provider with any kind of

1054
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,160
protocol terms

1055
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,280
so you know we all we really get is this

1056
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,800
very

1057
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,760
coarse understanding that data is being

1058
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,599
pushed from one cloud service provider

1059
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,040
to another and i think all of us here

1060
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,119
can agree that for someone to really

1061
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,839
understand how skim works they have to

1062
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,599
understand more nuance than that right

1063
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,599
they they you know the data flow the

1064
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,079
direction of data flow is important but

1065
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,800
there are a ton of concepts that

1066
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,920
an actual implementer of the

1067
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,319
specification has to understand and

1068
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,640
we'll go through some of those concepts

1069
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,960
um a little bit farther along but the

1070
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,640
you know the big one here is there is

1071
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,560
the confusion over service provider

1072
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,119
because in 7643

1073
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,119
um you know service provider is

1074
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,280
generally defined as

1075
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,240
as being an entity that runs a service

1076
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
endpoint the restful endpoint

1077
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,640
right and a client is defined as the

1078
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,680
entity that is accessing that endpoint

1079
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,720
and

1080
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,800
so you know when you when you talk about

1081
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,640
pushes and pulls

1082
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,960
uh we uh you know there's an implication

1083
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,359
here that is the client pushing to the

1084
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,680
service provider or the client pulling

1085
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,280
from the service provider but none of

1086
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,599
that is is explicitly

1087
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,599
defined it's left

1088
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,599
sort of um

1089
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,319
for you know for the reader to

1090
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,400
you know peruse both you know you really

1091
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,760
have to read all three documents before

1092
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,839
you can come to any conclusions which i

1093
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,160
believe is makes this document slightly

1094
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,280
yes less useful

1095
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,720
um

1096
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,560
you know the the next question is you

1097
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,960
know that again with subscriber

1098
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,359
our is a subscriber a client

1099
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,000
we don't know we don't think so uh you

1100
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
know just based on this list if you look

1101
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,960
at it

1102
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,880
um you know if an es if if an ecs is

1103
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,839
pushing to a csp then great that yes you

1104
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,319
know ecs would likely be the client and

1105
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,880
the csp would likely be the the service

1106
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,920
provider

1107
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,160
um

1108
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,000
but what about the other options you

1109
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,520
know what if what if we want the

1110
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,119
opposite to happen right we what if we

1111
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,000
want the ecs to be the service provider

1112
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,079
and the csp to be the client those

1113
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,520
things are also possible and they're not

1114
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,119
described here

1115
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,240
um

1116
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,079
just stopping anyone want to comment on

1117
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,000
these use cases has anyone had

1118
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,520
experience in

1119
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,319
reading this doc

1120
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,760
i'm guessing people don't because i

1121
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,119
don't think it's a you know i don't

1122
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,680
think um it's a useful aid at this time

1123
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,200
and so we're sort of in this situation

1124
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,119
where no one's read it no one knows it

1125
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,319
exists and um hopefully people will

1126
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,920
feel the need to be able to come help me

1127
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,760
improve it

1128
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,200
if you want to go ahead

1129
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,598
and see

1130
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:12,960
so

1131
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,720
here's the other question to contemplate

1132
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,640
right how has identity management

1133
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,119
changed in the 10 years since

1134
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:22,640
7642 was started

1135
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,440
and

1136
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,800
where we are now

1137
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,880
um you know and how many of those

1138
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,680
concepts are actually important for

1139
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,280
implementers as they look at the skim

1140
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,000
specification so uh you know you look at

1141
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,560
the sso trigger as an example

1142
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,440
of

1143
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,119
of how the world has changed right

1144
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,119
privileged access management

1145
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,800
um is now in 2021 an absolutely critical

1146
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,680
part

1147
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,119
of

1148
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,839
of most

1149
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,200
enterprise security regimes governance

1150
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,480
regimes

1151
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,280
and

1152
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,400
that idea of a real-time

1153
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,800
ability to create to quickly create an

1154
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,760
account

1155
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,480
it existed in 2011 but it existed

1156
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,880
primarily as a

1157
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,119
a federation concept where you know you

1158
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,760
when you arrive at a relying party

1159
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,760
the relying party would take the data

1160
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,480
from us from an sso assertion and push

1161
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,800
it into a database right create the user

1162
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,960
on demand at that time there's a whole

1163
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,000
bunch of on-demand capabilities and and

1164
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,280
um

1165
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,520
use cases that exist now

1166
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,839
um you know we have a ton of workflow

1167
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,839
around privilege elevation

1168
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,400
that's super important as well

1169
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,680
so you know cross domain um

1170
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,000
you know not not just access but

1171
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,800
elevation those two concepts are are one

1172
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,200
example of this um

1173
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,240
another interesting thing to note and

1174
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,920
this is more to 76 43 and 44 is that um

1175
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,079
web hooks didn't exist

1176
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,760
as i understand it they did not exist

1177
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,599
before skin was created

1178
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,280
so

1179
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,119
you know do we have to think about uh

1180
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,960
those kinds of um

1181
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,240
you know

1182
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,720
industry changes that have occurred

1183
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,160
around us

1184
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,680
proof of possession

1185
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,400
is another example you know we um

1186
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,160
we have

1187
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,440
some basic requirements right now in um

1188
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,000
76 43 and 44

1189
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,720
around oauth but we don't have like

1190
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,800
strong security recommendations for skin

1191
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,480
because those those didn't exist we

1192
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,680
didn't have

1193
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,839
things like

1194
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,520
um depop

1195
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,599
at the time that this document was being

1196
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,760
created and so the question then becomes

1197
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,079
are are these kinds of concepts and use

1198
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,880
cases things that we do want a skim

1199
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:44,160
implementer to be aware of um you know

1200
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,319
we have a lot of issues right now with

1201
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,359
folks

1202
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,200
taking what i would call the hello world

1203
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,440
path to implementing specifications

1204
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,760
where they implement it until it

1205
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,680
succeeds right they implement it until

1206
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,760
the user gains access but what they

1207
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,800
don't do

1208
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,880
is check whether users that shouldn't

1209
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,400
have access don't

1210
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,319
and you know this is this is a big

1211
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,880
problem industry-wide in my opinion and

1212
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,599
it's something that we should be more

1213
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,359
what's the word

1214
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,480
we should be better able to advise now

1215
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,560
especially as folks who who are writing

1216
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,599
clients

1217
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,920
are trying to understand the bounds of

1218
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,000
of what they should implement

1219
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,240
anything does anyone else have a list or

1220
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,839
is there anything others would want to

1221
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:26,880
bring up

1222
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,079
around

1223
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,079
you know changes in the way identity

1224
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,960
management has changed

1225
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,920
um the other one that i want to bring up

1226
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,640
here is maybe the simplest one which is

1227
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,400
in 2011

1228
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,520
it was

1229
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,440
almost a given

1230
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,319
that

1231
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,880
enterprises on premises

1232
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,119
would be the heart of any kind of

1233
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,559
provisioning regime i don't know if

1234
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,160
anyone wants to challenge me on that but

1235
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,480
having been there myself

1236
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,079
that that's my

1237
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,720
you know that's my my memory right was

1238
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,480
that people

1239
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,119
loved the cloud in limited doses

1240
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,440
and really never thought that a cloud an

1241
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,040
entire cloud native

1242
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,520
uh regime was anywhere near coming true

1243
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,440
but we are here we are 10 years down the

1244
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,400
line and so the idea of a pure cloud

1245
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,839
native

1246
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,119
enterprise

1247
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,280
is starting to be true there are cloud

1248
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,000
native enterprises today and so that

1249
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,319
idea of you know all

1250
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,880
every cloud element

1251
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,839
is

1252
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,240
is trying to now negotiate their service

1253
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,880
provider-ness versus their clientness

1254
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,599
and that stuff is all uh

1255
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,520
just changing right

1256
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,760
yep you have janelle in the queue she

1257
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,760
might want to comment as well

1258
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,960
excellent go ahead janelle

1259
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,079
um yeah pam just to add on to some of

1260
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,640
your observations in the last 10 years

1261
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,800
and how identity has changed

1262
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,599
um you know i think when we were looking

1263
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,000
at skim back then it was really between

1264
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,920
you know maybe you know within an

1265
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,000
organization to another organization but

1266
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,119
not this

1267
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,520
kind of explosion of the propagation of

1268
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,280
the cloud and all the service providers

1269
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,839
that are out there and all the funnels

1270
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,839
of all the data that's uh that's

1271
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,200
floating around

1272
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,359
and so i think that there's kind of a

1273
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:21,119
narrow view just really based on the

1274
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,880
existing implementations of how people

1275
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,240
were implementing

1276
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,079
locally within their organizations say

1277
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:27,680
provisioning services or identity

1278
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,240
services for their enterprise but then

1279
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,359
that expanded reach now globally

1280
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,880
i think there were notions of how that

1281
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,079
might work

1282
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:36,880
but

1283
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,800
we didn't have that practical experience

1284
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,440
as we do now

1285
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,680
that makes perfect sense

1286
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,200
and you know probably the last big

1287
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,160
change is uh that governance has become

1288
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,480
a security imperative

1289
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,680
and that

1290
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,640
you know

1291
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,400
i would say in 2011

1292
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,319
governance was primarily an accounting

1293
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:57,839
measure you know you would count all

1294
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,200
your users you would make sure you had

1295
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,400
the right users

1296
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,720
you might sign a quarterly

1297
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,000
affidavit

1298
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,079
and what we're seeing now is this huge

1299
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,200
push for real-time understanding of who

1300
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,119
has access to what system

1301
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,920
and you know with uh an expectation that

1302
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,079
if attackers are in the system

1303
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,480
there is a detection that can occur

1304
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,640
and a remediation that can occur so

1305
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,200
instead of every quarter looking at your

1306
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,359
user list for for a financial resource

1307
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,520
and saying hey john smith is dead we

1308
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,040
should really remove him

1309
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,880
right we're now in a situation where

1310
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,640
attackers are

1311
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,720
you know gaining access

1312
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,559
creating a user with administrative

1313
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,160
privileges

1314
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,240
executing five commands deleting that

1315
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,599
user and those kinds of activities now

1316
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,200
um make

1317
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,040
provisioning far far more important

1318
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,440
right it's not just a case now of having

1319
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,599
to deal with that with users who might

1320
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,079
get terminated and then try to sabotage

1321
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,319
the company you're really looking at

1322
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,200
using

1323
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,640
provisioning using

1324
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,400
user

1325
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,000
an understanding of who's and what

1326
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,520
systems to keep the entire company safe

1327
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,720
all right so if you want to go ahead

1328
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,520
so

1329
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,800
what 7642 doesn't do today which i think

1330
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,839
it should is it should talk about

1331
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:18,640
how

1332
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,160
clients today implement

1333
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,319
bi-directionality because the truth is

1334
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,240
there is you know we're not

1335
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,000
purely pushing and we're not purely

1336
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,720
pulling in almost every circumstance

1337
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,720
we are you know generally speaking

1338
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,760
there's a flow a data flow right where

1339
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,400
we are you know the creation of accounts

1340
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,040
occur in one direction and it may occur

1341
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,760
from skim client to skin provider or it

1342
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,520
may occur from service from you know um

1343
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,240
from

1344
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,839
the you know the flow may run from

1345
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,520
service provider to skim client but the

1346
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,359
skim it's because the skim client is

1347
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,400
pulling data so understanding this

1348
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,480
diagram to me is a big part of what we

1349
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,720
can do with 7642

1350
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,000
right if you think about

1351
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,480
how a push pull works um when the data

1352
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,559
flow is moving from skim client to skin

1353
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,960
to service provider generally speaking

1354
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,800
what it means is the skim client is

1355
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,400
making those create

1356
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,599
delete

1357
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:14,800
um you know

1358
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,240
patch post

1359
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,960
or patch pull you know uh put types of

1360
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,400
commands

1361
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,040
but they're also using get commands

1362
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,440
constantly right to make sure that they

1363
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,280
have the right idea of what the service

1364
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,640
provider knows

1365
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,319
to be able to check whether an

1366
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:31,920
incremental

1367
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,559
push is even needed right so it isn't

1368
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,680
just a case of of the data flow it's a

1369
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,440
case of the skim client having to be

1370
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,040
sophisticated enough

1371
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,280
to know what it can search for when to

1372
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,480
make for

1373
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,480
uh you know to make their queries

1374
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,599
efficient

1375
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,319
so you know giving a better more nuanced

1376
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,160
view to folks who want

1377
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,240
to be a skim client and who want to be

1378
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,119
able to update service providers

1379
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,440
would be very very useful

1380
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,880
if you look at the second piece down

1381
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,760
here

1382
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,440
um

1383
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,839
in the same way if you are a skim client

1384
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,160
who has to pull data from a service

1385
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,680
provider

1386
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,920
there may absolutely be pushes that

1387
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,640
occur and that is you know that

1388
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,319
comes to this idea of multiple starts of

1389
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,960
authority which i think is another place

1390
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,040
where in the last 10 years we've gotten

1391
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,200
a lot more sophisticated so it's

1392
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,319
absolutely possible for example in an hr

1393
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:27,200
system

1394
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,960
that the hr system is the service

1395
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,000
provider

1396
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,240
that you know a cloud platform might be

1397
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,040
pulling data from the service provider

1398
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,680
um and might even be responsible for the

1399
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,520
existence of the user

1400
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,000
um but is going to push back and you

1401
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,520
know is going to play the authority for

1402
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,160
an email address for example

1403
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,240
and so uh you know so

1404
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,800
it just isn't as simplistic now as it

1405
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,559
might have used to be

1406
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,040
and so we absolutely have to understand

1407
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,359
how the user is moving right how the

1408
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,040
accounts are being being created through

1409
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,960
the system but we need to give more

1410
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,200
nuanced advice

1411
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,040
on how you know

1412
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,079
how

1413
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,440
a

1414
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,680
you know a user with a specific

1415
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,920
business goal can actually deploy these

1416
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,240
tools

1417
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,920
all right if you want to go to the next

1418
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,040
one

1419
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,720
so the two patterns you see here

1420
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,640
combine right and this is the other

1421
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,760
piece that is not addressed in 7642

1422
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,359
um you

1423
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,440
you end up with these chains of

1424
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,880
provisioning where

1425
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,800
uh you know you might have a cloud

1426
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,920
platform

1427
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,359
in the middle right as a service

1428
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:38,160
provider and you might have clients

1429
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,720
looking to both push and pull data

1430
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,480
so you know in this case another you

1431
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,799
know this could be workday on the

1432
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,240
left-hand side and it could be

1433
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,760
salesforce on the right-hand side and it

1434
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,880
could be

1435
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,599
google in the middle as an example

1436
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,680
so understanding where you are in this

1437
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,599
hierarchy and you know related to your

1438
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,200
start of authority

1439
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,280
becomes important because it changes you

1440
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,720
know just because you're a client

1441
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,720
attaching to the service provider does

1442
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,559
not mean that's enough data for you to

1443
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,960
understand what you should do next

1444
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,799
and you know

1445
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,680
this is also where the pagination and

1446
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,160
synchronization

1447
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,400
discussions come in we have given you

1448
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,359
know there's no guidance at all for

1449
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:22,000
folks as to how they should be thinking

1450
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,720
about reconciling data keeping data in

1451
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,839
sync

1452
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,359
and i think we can better prepare our

1453
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,680
users in this case

1454
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,680
i'm just going to do a quick time check

1455
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,799
nancy um do you want me to be done

1456
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,400
by 5 a.m

1457
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,520
um

1458
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,079
you you have 15 more minutes

1459
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:43,599
okay all right and i think

1460
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,440
and dan uh janelle and danny for that

1461
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,920
but yeah you have 15 minutes left

1462
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,440
okay

1463
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,200
cool

1464
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,078
um all right so

1465
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,960
in that case so so in this case i've

1466
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,799
defined this term of provisioning hub i

1467
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:02,160
don't know that this is the right term

1468
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,359
it's not a term that's used in the

1469
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,280
specifications today

1470
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,200
but you know if

1471
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,880
if it's the case that we want these

1472
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,160
kinds of relationships to be

1473
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,440
communicated

1474
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,760
then i think terms like provisioning hub

1475
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,680
might be more valuable

1476
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,200
right that show that data is you know

1477
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,160
sort of

1478
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,880
ingressing and egressing so to speak

1479
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,240
compared to talking about a cloud

1480
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,839
service provider because essentially

1481
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:24,880
everyone's

1482
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,880
a cloud service provider today so it's

1483
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,240
not super valuable to call them that um

1484
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,319
you know i'm open obviously

1485
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:34,559
you know we can propose any set of terms

1486
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,760
we want but i do believe that some terms

1487
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,920
to help understand the difference here

1488
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,520
are important and so you know if you're

1489
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,599
a for example if you're an implementer

1490
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,040
who is

1491
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,000
you know who has a a sas application

1492
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,240
and wants to be able to pull data from

1493
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,240
let's say you know three major cloud

1494
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,880
service platforms right pick any three

1495
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,960
they may actually have to you know they

1496
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,640
they may not be able to play the client

1497
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,960
in all three situations and so having

1498
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,599
them understand that and understand

1499
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,280
that they're essentially that you know

1500
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,440
the final stop on a train

1501
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,599
is super valuable uh if you want to go

1502
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:13,359
to the next slide right this is so this

1503
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:15,200
is one common pattern right where the

1504
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,040
service provider is the provisioning hub

1505
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,359
the second common pattern is the case

1506
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,599
where the skim client is a provisioning

1507
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:23,839
hub and in case you think that that

1508
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:25,359
there are no examples of this in the

1509
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,480
wild

1510
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,119
microsoft azure is an example of this

1511
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,680
pattern right whereas i believe that

1512
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,839
amazon and google are both examples of

1513
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:36,480
the service provider pattern

1514
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,680
so in this case um you know the the

1515
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,520
you know if you're that same person that

1516
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,359
same implementer trying to set up your

1517
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,520
sas app to receive data you're going to

1518
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,200
have to implement an endpoint versus

1519
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,200
implementing a client

1520
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,079
right and and ultimately the decision

1521
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,960
you make there depends a ton on what

1522
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,839
your downstream

1523
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,280
partner

1524
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,960
already has set up

1525
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,480
and that's i think a useful thing to

1526
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,040
also communicate here

1527
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,040
um and again it has to be bi-directional

1528
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,240
right the the

1529
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,720
um the pattern that that was brought up

1530
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,319
in this case of you know if you're on

1531
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:15,920
the right-hand side here is the as a

1532
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,680
service provider on the right

1533
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,640
is that

1534
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,359
um you may be absolutely oh i just

1535
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,040
realized my errors are backwards but

1536
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,280
anyways you may be pulling data from

1537
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,319
that

1538
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,160
or the skim data you know the skim

1539
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,240
client is going to be looking at you all

1540
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,680
the time

1541
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,440
right in order to push data to you

1542
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,559
because they're going to be looking at

1543
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,000
whether they need to push in the first

1544
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,119
place

1545
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,599
right so those patterns of push-pull

1546
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,920
become more and more

1547
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,839
important for implementers to understand

1548
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,760
uh oh i got a

1549
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,200
comment in the chat since skim is an

1550
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,520
http protocol the terms all originate

1551
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,760
from http yes

1552
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,000
that's that's fair enough but i do think

1553
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,720
that an overlay um in this case is

1554
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,720
is useful i don't i don't know if there

1555
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,839
is a there isn't really a concept of

1556
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,440
chaining i don't think right and that on

1557
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,200
the http

1558
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,280
front if there is let me know

1559
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,559
and we can always adopt it

1560
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,599
all right

1561
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:17,599
so

1562
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,760
let's look at yes perfect thanks nancy

1563
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,920
so again these things compose right so

1564
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,559
the chains start to compose as well and

1565
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:25,920
we start to get

1566
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,480
maps of how account creations right and

1567
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,640
account updates ripple through

1568
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,799
a company right or through a system or

1569
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:33,839
you know

1570
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:35,200
through a network

1571
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,359
and so what you can see here is i've you

1572
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:39,359
know i've got notation to denote where

1573
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,200
the start of authority is so in this

1574
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,319
case the top left skim client is sort of

1575
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:49,440
the origination of the account and as um

1576
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,000
as you know the skim client there pushes

1577
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,079
to the service provider what happens is

1578
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:55,520
you may have a provisioning hub that in

1579
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,359
fact can handle both service provider

1580
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:58,799
and skim client

1581
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:01,280
operations right so in this case you've

1582
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,119
got a full fan out effect

1583
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,040
right so you you know data gets pushed

1584
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,799
from the original skim client into the

1585
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,240
service provider

1586
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,680
and then what hap what's happening is

1587
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,440
some clients are pulling that data in

1588
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,480
order for them to be updated um but the

1589
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,319
cloud platform may also be pushing that

1590
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:19,040
data to other service providers right so

1591
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,520
now you've got a full-on ecosystem of

1592
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,160
pushes and pulls and ripples of data

1593
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,240
the one thing to note here

1594
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,680
is if the on the you know the service

1595
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,119
provider on the bottom left although

1596
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:32,319
it's drawn with a data flow

1597
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:34,960
that implies that it's um

1598
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,119
that it's a downstream application it's

1599
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,440
not right if you look at the pattern the

1600
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,359
pattern for that service provider is

1601
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:42,400
identical

1602
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,079
to the pattern for the service provider

1603
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:48,160
on the right so essentially uh you know

1604
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,920
the patterns start to collapse at some

1605
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:50,880
point

1606
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,960
right depending on the on the um the

1607
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,880
direction and the directions matter far

1608
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:55,680
more

1609
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,760
about where this big dotted line is than

1610
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,680
about any kind of

1611
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,640
overall direction right things start to

1612
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,079
um to blend

1613
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,599
and if you go to the next one so that

1614
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:06,960
you know so that's one case the case

1615
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,119
where the skin client is kicking off the

1616
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:10,799
avalanche you know the second use case

1617
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:12,960
is where the service provider is kicking

1618
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,280
off the avalanche right so a database

1619
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,559
gets updated

1620
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,640
the data passively sits at the service

1621
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,480
provider waiting

1622
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,359
and

1623
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:23,680
the cloud platform as the client then

1624
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,240
actively goes and pulls that data from

1625
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,240
the service provider and

1626
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,079
kicks off the whole ripple effect again

1627
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:31,920
right whether that whether there are

1628
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,640
entities passively fetching or entities

1629
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,280
that are actively being pushed to you

1630
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,640
so to me this is this this understanding

1631
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,319
of how all of it works

1632
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,319
right as this much more complex set of

1633
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:47,040
pulls and pushes are far more important

1634
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,720
um than just understanding there's such

1635
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,280
a thing as an overall push or an overall

1636
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,599
pull

1637
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:54,720
all right you want to hit the next one

1638
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,200
and we're getting to the end here

1639
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,440
so then the question becomes what can we

1640
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,079
do right what should we do we don't have

1641
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:03,280
to write

1642
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,160
an entire opus on how skim works right

1643
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,039
so i think what we want is a minimal

1644
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:11,760
amount of data that is going to make it

1645
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,240
easier to read the specification right

1646
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,280
um

1647
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,520
and so for me there's some basics here

1648
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,680
first of all we have to align

1649
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,920
the taxonomy we have to talk about

1650
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,319
service providers and clients in ways

1651
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:25,920
that are helpful to understand how they

1652
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,079
work in the specification

1653
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:28,960
this

1654
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,559
as it exists today 7642 never

1655
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,039
never talks about service providers or

1656
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:37,359
clients never talks about resources or

1657
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:39,440
resource types it never talks about

1658
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,160
extensibility it it never uses the term

1659
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,839
provisioning domain which is defined in

1660
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:45,760
7643

1661
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,359
um you know it

1662
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:49,839
none of that is even in the document and

1663
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:51,680
i think that's uh something we can

1664
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,640
address

1665
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,400
um and then you know the

1666
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,640
the from a use case perspective now we

1667
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,920
have much more

1668
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,000
nuanced use cases that we can discuss

1669
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,520
right we can discuss

1670
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,000
for example you know the 7642 doesn't

1671
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,640
talk about groups at all

1672
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,480
it literally only talks about users

1673
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,640
right so just that you know you think of

1674
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,520
the

1675
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,000
um the difficulty that exists um in

1676
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,640
understanding what to do with large

1677
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,280
groups right million user or million

1678
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,559
member groups

1679
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:21,599
um

1680
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,119
talking about those use cases i think

1681
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,200
can be very very helpful have people

1682
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,839
understand what they need right um the

1683
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,079
slash me endpoint is never discussed

1684
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:31,920
search is never discussed

1685
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,240
uh so you know some

1686
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,079
number of things we don't have to

1687
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,480
exhaustively drain it but finding the

1688
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,079
set of use cases that actually give

1689
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:41,839
people the whole picture of the

1690
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:44,079
specification is valuable you know

1691
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:46,160
custom setting up custom resources for

1692
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,839
example would be a very good use case in

1693
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:49,520
my opinion

1694
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,200
um and then you know and then there are

1695
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,880
some of these more advanced concepts

1696
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,480
which we can decide whether to include

1697
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,240
or not um this the idea of incremental

1698
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,079
attribute exchange

1699
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:03,520
never discussed and that's super useful

1700
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,839
um the you know that like put and post

1701
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:07,440
to read the spec and understand the

1702
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,760
difference between a put

1703
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,920
and a patch is is pretty hard work but

1704
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,480
we could very easily make it uh better

1705
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,599
with a use case that describes it um

1706
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,039
and then of course synchronization is

1707
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:22,240
the other one that's a heavily discussed

1708
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,599
part of this new skin 3.0 world

1709
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,920
um so

1710
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,760
let's see oh

1711
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,359
phil you've got a comment in the chat

1712
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:32,480
about looking at things from an

1713
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,160
information perspective i would love to

1714
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:34,880
know

1715
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,160
what you're thinking there if you want

1716
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,839
to jump on the cube please do

1717
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:40,799
um

1718
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:41,599
yeah

1719
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,520
pam that comment was

1720
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,000
um well before

1721
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,760
okay yeah i'm sorry i didn't see it soon

1722
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,039
enough um no no no that's fine

1723
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,880
sorry phil if you do if you do want to

1724
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,640
come on and make a comment we of course

1725
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,400
would love it um

1726
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,599
but at the end of the day you know

1727
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,680
here's what we i think we need right we

1728
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,440
need something that's

1729
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,880
easy to read

1730
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,280
and um that is going to

1731
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,760
be time well spent for anyone who takes

1732
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,839
the time to look at it

1733
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,599
and then something that in fact is going

1734
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:12,559
to

1735
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:14,480
change how people read the specification

1736
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,920
in a positive way

1737
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,319
right and then the last thing is just to

1738
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,839
make sure that there is nuance

1739
01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:23,359
that that can be gleaned out of this

1740
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:25,760
document that helps them

1741
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,440
understand complexities as they look at

1742
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,880
the spec

1743
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,880
and i think that's it i will i will

1744
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,960
leave it there

1745
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,440
hopefully this is useful for folks but i

1746
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,920
i would like to ask for volunteers so

1747
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,240
you know i am committed to trying to put

1748
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,680
a draft together

1749
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,920
as soon as i can um and submit it to

1750
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,319
this working group for consideration

1751
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,240
is uh you know if there's anyone who's

1752
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,680
interested in

1753
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,680
being part of this you can respond on

1754
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:52,960
the email

1755
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,039
list i'm assuming you could contact

1756
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:56,960
nancy or barry

1757
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,000
you can speak up now

1758
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:01,520
anything like that would be greatly

1759
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,520
appreciated

1760
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,039
well

1761
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:13,760
so this is a little uh disconcerting so

1762
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,839
phil if you have no audio

1763
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:20,400
um pam you've got four minutes left so

1764
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,839
if anybody has comments or feedback

1765
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:26,000
or additions or a different perspective

1766
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,160
to what pam presented

1767
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,240
um we can discuss it in the next four

1768
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,000
minutes

1769
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,720
uh pam you have a volunteer in janelle

1770
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,960
yes she's been on the channel

1771
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,400
she's happy to join you um

1772
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,280
so next on the agenda phil if you have

1773
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,240
no audio you had mentioned that there

1774
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,720
was potentially somebody else who could

1775
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:52,118
also present

1776
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:10,640
yeah i couldn't remember his name so

1777
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,880
there isn't a way we can call phil in or

1778
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,240
anything like that is sir with me deco

1779
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,160
ah greg wilson

1780
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,558
um

1781
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:25,280
yeah alessandra i don't know if you have

1782
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,400
any other

1783
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,400
suggestions

1784
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,240
to have phil be able to present because

1785
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,038
he's up next

1786
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,119
we could try

1787
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,160
um

1788
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,160
getting me on the phone with phil and

1789
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,240
seeing if it will play through my

1790
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,959
microphone

1791
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:49,520
let me see if that can work

1792
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:51,119
okay

1793
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:54,440
thanks barry

1794
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,440
so pam i think this is a really good

1795
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,960
start at the modernization um it looks

1796
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,000
like you're introducing some new terms

1797
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,480
as well that could help

1798
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,799
um

1799
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:18,799
help provide a guide i guess as we

1800
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:20,640
modernize

1801
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,198
the protocols as well

1802
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:25,839
um

1803
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:27,839
yeah i'm hoping i'm hoping to for

1804
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:29,839
guidance i mean i think

1805
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:33,040
what we can do now is revive seventies

1806
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,679
you know revise um this use cases and

1807
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:37,839
definitions document to point to the

1808
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:40,479
current skim document so that they're a

1809
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:42,719
pair and then in theory there's a

1810
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,359
possible revision that has to happen

1811
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:49,198
at the point where we where 76 43 and 44

1812
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:52,000
are subtly changed right if we if we

1813
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,080
decide to subtly change them

1814
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,839
right so i you know i feel like this

1815
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:57,600
work there will be an initial piece of

1816
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,600
work to align

1817
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,238
to existing skin 2.0 specs

1818
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,158
and then a follow-up

1819
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:07,040
addendum possibly you know prior to us

1820
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,198
trying to go to any kind of you know get

1821
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:10,880
any kind of rfc number

1822
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,640
to be sure that nothing's changed out

1823
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,199
from under us

1824
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,439
okay

1825
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,679
well i suspect that you know once you

1826
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:23,120
put a a proposed draft in place we can

1827
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,920
evolve it over time

1828
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,158
um

1829
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:31,040
perfect typically

1830
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,759
yeah in in the other working groups the

1831
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:36,238
use cases help guide

1832
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:39,120
how we shape the updates to both the

1833
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,000
scheme and the protocol as well

1834
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,080
and potentially other drafts

1835
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,359
as well

1836
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:47,359
that makes sense i think i mean i think

1837
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,600
what the you know the group can do in

1838
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,238
general is also keep us from

1839
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:54,480
boiling the ocean right

1840
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,239
um there's definitely a line that has to

1841
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:58,480
be drawn as to what's useful for people

1842
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,800
to know and what's too much information

1843
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,679
so

1844
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:04,560
i think that'll be yeah

1845
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:05,679
yeah

1846
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,159
sorry i forgot to protect your your last

1847
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:09,280
slide

1848
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,400
that's right and it was so pretty

1849
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,719
well my bad um

1850
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:19,040
but literally anyone is free hey i see

1851
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,560
phil

1852
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,480
can you hear me now

1853
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:23,520

1854
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,000
awesome

1855
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,480
and

1856
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:32,320
we are in perfect timing

1857
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,360
browser number four

1858
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,400
okay

1859
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,199
i presume i should go ahead and share

1860
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:45,199
your slides now so thank you pam and um

1861
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:48,320
so just to close on the use cases

1862
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,280
you can also contact pam directly as

1863
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,320
she's volunteering to put the proposal

1864
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,440
for

1865
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:59,120
updating the use cases draft

1866
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,840
feel free to contact me as well but also

1867
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,719
as she is taking on the pen

1868
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:07,920
um feel free to contact her directly

1869
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,920
to get more involved

1870
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,560
okay with that phil

1871
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,400
so happy

1872
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,960
you are now on

1873
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,840
i can't tell you how horrified i was i'm

1874
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,920
sorry for all the messing around here

1875
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:22,800
yeah

1876
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,560
danny was kind of sweating too because

1877
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,040
he was volunteering you know as a last

1878
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,159
resort

1879
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,080
so glad to have you on

1880
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,640
apparently safari latest doesn't work

1881
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,440
and uh firefox isn't even talking with

1882
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,360
my os so

1883
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,600
who knows

1884
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,400
uh

1885
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,800
so chrome's working okay

1886
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,320
um

1887
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,159
yeah so this draft

1888
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:47,360
um

1889
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,239
came out essentially after skim was

1890
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:51,520
published

1891
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,320
uh

1892
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:56,560
and the problem that came up was that uh

1893
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,760
initially

1894
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,840
uh when you have very large groups

1895
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,760
sometimes you just want a sample of the

1896
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,040
data

1897
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,000
uh and the idea was hey phil how can we

1898
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,360
page

1899
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,239
uh multi-value attributes and and i was

1900
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,159
a little confused that i noticed people

1901
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:14,800
on the email list are confused

1902
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,560
um

1903
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:19,760
we want we want to page the values

1904
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,960
or say i want a range of values

1905
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,560
by index

1906
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,120
rather than paging

1907
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,040
resources which is the normal what the

1908
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,040
skim protocol does it lets you page

1909
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,880
through a set of resources that might be

1910
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,360
returned from a query in this case the

1911
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,560
intent is

1912
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,000
i want to select

1913
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,080
a set of rows from a multi-value

1914
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,840
attribute to return

1915
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,920
so this spec provides

1916
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,800
two

1917
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,080
types of ways to select those values

1918
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,600
either by filter or by

1919
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,080
index essentially

1920
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,920
and to help

1921
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,239
avoid some confusion i've changed the

1922
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:01,600
name to multi-value filtering

1923
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,840
because this spec kept getting rolled up

1924
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,000
into the stateful page discussion which

1925
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,719
really is a separate thing

1926
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:10,719
um

1927
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:11,920
so

1928
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,400
uh i think we can go to the next

1929
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,199
slide so this this this draft was

1930
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:19,280
submitted after the group finished its

1931
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,199
charter and that's why it sat around for

1932
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:23,199
a few years really hasn't had any

1933
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,719
discussion

1934
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:25,840
um

1935
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,159
so in skim

1936
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:30,080
when we have a filter

1937
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,040
um

1938
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,120
we have something called a value i

1939
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,960
believe it's called a value path and

1940
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,800
really what it is is normally you might

1941
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,560
say emails

1942
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,480
equals phil dot hunt yahoo.com

1943
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,760
um

1944
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,320
but really what you're trying to say is

1945
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,199
if if uh if you want a way to say if the

1946
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,199
emails.type

1947
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:54,320
equals work and emails.value

1948
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,400
ends with

1949
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,199
yahoo.com

1950
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,199
i want to return

1951
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:00,480
the value

1952
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,400
and we introduced in the skim protocol

1953
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,960
spec the value path notation which is to

1954
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,199
put square brackets

1955
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:09,840
uh after an attribute

1956
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,600
so that you could execute the filter

1957
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,840
within the context of that multi-value

1958
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,000
complex multi-valued attribute so i can

1959
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,360
say

1960
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:21,679
email square bracket type equals work

1961
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:23,199
and

1962
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:26,719
value ends with yahoo.com would select a

1963
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,719
particular row

1964
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:29,840
from

1965
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,920
that um

1966
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,040
attribute

1967
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,280
um and the thinking here was why don't

1968
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,600
we use that notation on the attributes

1969
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,480
list

1970
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,719
so that i can tell skim that when it

1971
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:42,239
returns

1972
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:44,880
that attribute i just want a particular

1973
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,199
row of data or a particular

1974
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:49,679
sub-attribute of data from that

1975
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:50,640
table

1976
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,560
uh sorry table

1977
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:57,840
it's from that json object that we have

1978
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:59,440
the

1979
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,520
we also then thought as well as doing a

1980
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,920
value path filter we want to do ranging

1981
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,080
much like we do with paging so we just

1982
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,480
use the start index

1983
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,120
and count parameters

1984
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,719
to specify

1985
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,960
if i'm got a group with a million

1986
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,719
members and i just want the first page

1987
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,560
of data i can say start index is one

1988
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,360
but i only want 10 rows

1989
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,120
and that saves a lot of

1990
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,120
data being returned unnecessarily

1991
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,719
so the extension defines this

1992
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:34,000
and

1993
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,480
it also defines two more things the

1994
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,159
first question that came up in the

1995
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:41,120
discussion we did have is how do i know

1996
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,600
how many values are available

1997
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,719
um the first time you execute this query

1998
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:49,520
the service provider can add a mata

1999
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:52,080
attribute

2000
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,800
meta.attribute.count to indicate what

2001
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,640
the number of rows are for that

2002
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,920
attribute

2003
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,120
um

2004
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,360
you can decide my thinking was is it

2005
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,840
would be returned only when you invoke

2006
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,920
this type of

2007
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,920
request

2008
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,840
but that we can discuss i don't know

2009
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,679
that you need to add it for every single

2010
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:13,760
request that comes in we'll see the

2011
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,800
example request coming up

2012
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,400
because this is going to be an

2013
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,760
enhancement to skim and it's its own rfc

2014
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,600
then you need some method to know that

2015
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,320
has the server implemented this rfc

2016
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,480
so we describe a discovery parameter in

2017
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,400
the service provider config

2018
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:35,239
as well in spec so next slide

2019
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:39,920
so

2020
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:43,599
this would be a get request

2021
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,360
and

2022
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:48,320
in this case the parameter attributes is

2023
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,480
normally used to say this is the list of

2024
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:54,000
attributes that i want returned

2025
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,159
but what we're doing is we're saying i

2026
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:57,920
want asterisks which is i want all the

2027
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,159
attributes but for emails

2028
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:02,480
i only want the rows for type equals

2029
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,480
work

2030
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:08,000
so that would be the get request

2031
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,280
go to the next slide

2032
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,239
and you can see that that emails is

2033
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:17,920
returned

2034
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,159
and there's only one value

2035
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:21,280
returned

2036
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,880
and it's the one that corresponds to

2037
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,360
type equals work as requested

2038
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,640
and

2039
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:27,600
uh

2040
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,920
the email stock count this is probably a

2041
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,800
bad example i should have said two or

2042
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,400
more because the example would be that

2043
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,480
it assumes that there's two or three

2044
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,320
email addresses and the count would

2045
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,560
reflect the number of actual

2046
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,120
email addresses available

2047
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,199
uh so the client knows that there is

2048
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:46,239
more

2049
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:48,960
um that's not meant to reflect

2050
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:52,080
uh uh the count of of items returned

2051
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,239
that wouldn't be that useful

2052
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:55,840
um so

2053
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,840
bad example on my part but the intent

2054
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,640
here is that emails.count

2055
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,640
would would indicate the number of

2056
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,320
values that are actually available

2057
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:10,599
so next slide

2058
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
so if i wanted to do multi-value paging

2059
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,239
uh and as i mentioned the term might not

2060
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:19,600
be the best

2061
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,280
uh because we're confusing it with

2062
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,239
resource results paging

2063
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:26,080
in this case we're doing members type

2064
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,760
equals group

2065
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,480
and count equals five

2066
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,760
and start index is one

2067
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,920
so if i had a type of group in other

2068
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,080
words a group within a group i want to

2069
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,440
know the first

2070
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,199
five

2071
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:42,640
members

2072
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,120
where the type equals group

2073
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,679
and we return that value so i don't have

2074
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:49,760
an example for this

2075
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,679
but that would be how you would specify

2076
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:55,440
a range in this case and it just follows

2077
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,920
the same pattern we've used for resource

2078
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:00,239
paging we can now use in the attributes

2079
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:02,718
parameter

2080
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:07,480
next slide

2081
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,640
so um

2082
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,920
the spec is fairly straightforward

2083
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,120
um

2084
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,600
some things to clean up is whether you

2085
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,159
want to have that count of values that

2086
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:23,199
are actually available

2087
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:26,640
i have to update and revise security and

2088
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,280
privacy considerations because

2089
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,600
privacy considerations is now a new

2090
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,480
thing

2091
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,480
so of course those have to be added and

2092
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,480
so if it became a working group document

2093
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,800
i would actually put that in

2094
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,080
as the uh in the draft uh as the as it

2095
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,520
gets adopted

2096
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,159
i do however think it's just it's since

2097
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:49,199
you're further restricting information

2098
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:50,400
um

2099
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,960
within the skim protocol spec you're

2100
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,480
actually narrowing

2101
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,640
uh the exposure information so i do

2102
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,320
think that these will be relatively

2103
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:59,760
straightforward and they'll follow the

2104
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,159
same security and privacy considerations

2105
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:03,199
that

2106
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:06,960
rfc 7644 has we're not introducing

2107
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,320
any new exposures here

2108
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:19,800
pam you're in the queue

2109
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,600
question when you say awaiting tentative

2110
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,600
agreement on extension mechanism is that

2111
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,679
agreement from this group or agreement

2112
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:29,320
from someone else

2113
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,400
you know i was just looking at that or

2114
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,080
going i don't remember what was

2115
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,080
referring to so

2116
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,080
um

2117
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,040
were you thinking maybe that it would

2118
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:52,080
get folded into an extension draft

2119
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,679
oh

2120
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:54,800
yes

2121
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,400
um

2122
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,960
yes uh i think that was yeah that's

2123
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,280
where i was going was uh depending on

2124
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,600
where the working group is going with

2125
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,880
if you if we're doing a skim v2 bis

2126
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,719
or something like that

2127
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:10,719
then there's no need for this to be a

2128
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:13,760
separate rfc i would support rolling it

2129
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,040
in with

2130
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,800
uh an enhanced

2131
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,400
skin draft

2132
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,199
um

2133
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:20,880
if we're just uh

2134
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,320
moving skim as it is 7644

2135
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,920
um

2136
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,560
if we're moving 7644 on to its next

2137
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,719
phase of formalization

2138
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,120
uh then we couldn't really add this new

2139
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,280
feature indirectly it would have to

2140
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,239
remain

2141
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:38,560
an extension draft

2142
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,639
so that's probably

2143
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:42,960
uh the biggest discussion is what's the

2144
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,560
process for

2145
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,239
moving this forward do we roll it into

2146
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:48,320
the core spec somehow because we're

2147
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,159
updating the course back

2148
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:51,679
or do we leave it

2149
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:54,800
as a separate enhancement

2150
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,199
so i may be hearing you volunteering to

2151
01:21:57,199 --> 01:22:00,320
be an editor for the core spec as well

2152
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,559
phil

2153
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:07,120
just putting it out there

2154
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:11,159
i'll contribute this part

2155
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:17,839
sounds good

2156
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:21,199
i don't think we had volunteers for for

2157
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:22,080
the

2158
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,120
course next yet so

2159
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:28,559
that's still under discussion

2160
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,800
so danny

2161
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:38,480
on the chat says he's interested in this

2162
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:41,519
work um

2163
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:47,679
so what we can do phil is

2164
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:50,639
communicate over the main list

2165
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:53,920
and check on interest on this body of

2166
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,000
work and then

2167
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,520
also then discuss

2168
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,040
where

2169
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,480
we include this body of work how's that

2170
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:03,360
yeah

2171
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,960
yeah

2172
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,639
yeah and that's another reason why i

2173
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:09,199
didn't want to do all the final

2174
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:10,560
uh

2175
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,480
the final security consideration stuff

2176
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,480
because it really depends on where we

2177
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,560
roll it next so

2178
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:17,440
um

2179
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:20,480
and i'm flexible as the author i

2180
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,360
um

2181
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,639
i don't know if it's useful to just say

2182
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:26,159
um

2183
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:27,120
for the

2184
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,000
process wise for the group to adopt it

2185
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,840
knowing that its final disposition is

2186
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,280
not known

2187
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,480
um

2188
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,920
but i i'm wondering if it helps engage i

2189
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,320
would like to see enough people show

2190
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,080
interest in it before we

2191
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:44,400
take it further

2192
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,080
and be sure of that which is the normal

2193
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,679
process so

2194
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:49,520
right right

2195
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,880
so

2196
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:53,120
um

2197
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,800
so so i can say uh my colleague at

2198
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,520
oracle greg wilson who who i was hoping

2199
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,960
could be here today

2200
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,199
did say that oracle intends to to

2201
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:06,480
implement it shortly

2202
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:12,320
okay

2203
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,320
i'm just writing down as an action item

2204
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:17,040
for myself to to put that call for

2205
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,519
interest

2206
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,040
already

2207
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,040
well you guys are doing great and

2208
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:28,719
sticking to the the time allocations

2209
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:32,320
if there's no other comments or feedback

2210
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:36,799
we can switch over to danny

2211
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:40,800
thank you fellain i'm glad that you're

2212
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,639
you're back with your weekend video

2213
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:46,960
thanks

2214
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,199
me too i was not

2215
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:56,638
wanting to talk about that stuff

2216
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,760
you're interested

2217
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,400
all right i mean but i i uh i haven't

2218
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:05,120
read the draft actually so

2219
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,880
uh there's a strong difference between

2220
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:07,840
the two

2221
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,199
um

2222
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:11,760
uh yeah so i i've written two different

2223
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,280
uh drafts

2224
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,199
uh the drafts themselves are sort of

2225
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:16,880
rough this is my first go around writing

2226
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:20,400
uh you know internet draft but um

2227
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,840
there's some

2228
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,000
like problems or you know opportunities

2229
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,360
for betterment of uh of the standard

2230
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,760
that i've seen working in the sort of

2231
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,960
the the sas like skim space the cloud

2232
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,239
skin space

2233
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:37,600
um that i i thought could be solved with

2234
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,400
uh some fairly simple extensions to add

2235
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,000
new resources

2236
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:42,800
uh

2237
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,520
next five please

2238
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:50,400
uh so the first draft is on a concept

2239
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,840
that i've tried to title uh verified

2240
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:54,639
domains um

2241
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:55,440
and

2242
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:58,239
in the cloud there's uh you know a lot

2243
01:25:58,239 --> 01:25:59,520
of different services particularly you

2244
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,440
know like email providers anything with

2245
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,239
like a hint of security to it

2246
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:05,199
um

2247
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:06,800
they

2248
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,360
uh they they like to

2249
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:12,880
require that ownership of uh domain name

2250
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,560
so you know at

2251
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,400
contoso.com

2252
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,159
uh is

2253
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:19,760
uh verified

2254
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,880
before you can add it to your uh your

2255
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,480
sas tenant

2256
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,480
uh and that's to you know obviously for

2257
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,320
uh prevent impersonation that sort of

2258
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,719
thing like me as an individual um

2259
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:32,560
without proper proof i shouldn't be able

2260
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,840
to go and register you know

2261
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,719
with uh with google and set up mail for

2262
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:39,600
them

2263
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,600
uh so

2264
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:42,639
uh

2265
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:43,920
obviously you know there's other things

2266
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:44,960
dns

2267
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:47,440
stop a lot of these things but um like

2268
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:50,719
you know mail routing but uh so the the

2269
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:52,880
problem that comes into play here

2270
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,360
is when a skim client

2271
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:58,159
is uh in you know the cloud world is

2272
01:26:58,159 --> 01:26:59,679
trying to

2273
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:01,840
uh provision a large

2274
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:06,000
set of users to uh

2275
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,840
into a

2276
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:11,040
uh into the the skim service so let's

2277
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:12,639
say it's an email provider or something

2278
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:13,760
of that sort

2279
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,280
um or

2280
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:18,639
uh any collaboration platform uh

2281
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:19,520
the

2282
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,560
username in many cases ends up following

2283
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:25,520
that userat domain.com format

2284
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:26,719
um

2285
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:30,000
and what is currently undetectable

2286
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,880
based on the skim standard is

2287
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,080
hey what format of name does the skim

2288
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,480
service require because some just do a

2289
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,480
simple you know it might be danny and

2290
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:44,840
some might be you know danny domain.com

2291
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:48,239
um and so being able to determine that

2292
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:50,719
is helpful but then also knowing uh for

2293
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:52,960
any instances where that you know user

2294
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,600
domain.com format is being used

2295
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:56,560
uh

2296
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,800
is the the right-hand side of that the

2297
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,639
domain.com part is there some sort of

2298
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:02,960
verification mechanism in place

2299
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,600
uh because if there is then what happens

2300
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,480
is if the client has uh you know data

2301
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,560
coming into it that doesn't align with

2302
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,120
what's allowed on the uh on this given

2303
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:15,360
service provider the client will send uh

2304
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,480
requests that fail uh if i try to you

2305
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:21,199
know create a user using a domain suffix

2306
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:22,639
that i have not proven ownership of in

2307
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:24,719
that collaboration platform

2308
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:27,440
uh it will fail and that's a it's an

2309
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,280
unnecessary use of resources for both

2310
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,440
the client and the service provider uh

2311
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,440
and it's something that's easily you

2312
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,120
know detectable and avoidable or it

2313
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,159
should be

2314
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:37,600
um

2315
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,400
so

2316
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:41,600
the the the entire idea of this draft is

2317
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,239
to add a slash verified domains endpoint

2318
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:46,320
so that uh

2319
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,280
so that

2320
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,360
any sort of skim client interacting with

2321
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:52,560
the service writer can read the list of

2322
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,719
allowed domains as well as some

2323
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:56,480
service writer config stuff

2324
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,440
to

2325
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:00,080
see whether or not uh you know this

2326
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:02,800
whole uh draft has been implemented

2327
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,719
um and that will allow the client to act

2328
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:07,440
intelligently and uh avoid sending

2329
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:10,880
requests that will obviously fail

2330
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,920
uh next slide please

2331
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:18,320
uh so yeah the two key components uh we

2332
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,639
have the verified domains resource i

2333
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:23,360
just mentioned that uh so i've written

2334
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,920
this uh with it only being read only so

2335
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,600
only http get

2336
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,360
uh there's

2337
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:32,080
some interest out there uh with parties

2338
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,199
that i've talked to

2339
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:36,719
about uh certain sas platforms uh having

2340
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,400
an option to

2341
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:41,440
trust domain verification from uh major

2342
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:43,520
idps that are connected to them

2343
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:44,960
uh i

2344
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,199
left that completely to the side i think

2345
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:49,280
that's probably a separate problem to be

2346
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,120
solved or aiming you know an extension

2347
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,719
to an extension or just a completely you

2348
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:55,120
know separate draft uh because there's a

2349
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,440
lot of security considerations there uh

2350
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,600
how do you stop a bad actor from uh

2351
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,760
trying to impersonate the you know a

2352
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,040
trusted

2353
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,600
uh skim client uh from the you know

2354
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,520
trusted from the perspective of the the

2355
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,840
service provider and i don't have the

2356
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,400
security background to write that so

2357
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,320
um and then we have the service writer

2358
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:17,600
config extension just to advertise uh

2359
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,000
is it available and a couple of uh key

2360
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:20,960
you know

2361
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,520
things of is this specific thing uh you

2362
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,199
know enabled or not

2363
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:28,159
uh next slide please

2364
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:33,280
uh so a quick run through the schema of

2365
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:36,400
the verified domain object

2366
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:39,440
uh so we have a domain name so fairly

2367
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:40,960
straightforward it's a string containing

2368
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,960
uh at least the second level domain and

2369
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,400
top level domain so that would be you

2370
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,400
know

2371
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:47,199
domain.com

2372
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:49,040
of the verified domain

2373
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:51,920
uh subdomains uh are supported as well

2374
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,440
so that would be you know

2375
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:57,360
x dot domain.com uh and you know uh

2376
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,360
recursively i think it's the right word

2377
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:01,120
uh down as well so if you don't want you

2378
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,080
know

2379
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:05,040
a.b.domain.com that would also be

2380
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,080
allowed

2381
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,560
uh there's then a boolean that says

2382
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,320
allow subdomains

2383
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,679
uh which

2384
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:13,040
is

2385
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:15,840
to really just advertise actually um

2386
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,920
about that piece uh

2387
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,520
that we just that i was just uh talking

2388
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,280
about the of sub domains

2389
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:24,080
uh there are instances where um there's

2390
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,239
uh a single organization may have many

2391
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:30,239
instances of a uh like a cloud platform

2392
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:32,400
in play it may be split by you know

2393
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,000
region by

2394
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,800
uh organization inside of the company uh

2395
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:37,920
there's you know a whole bunch of

2396
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:39,360
different ways that you can split up

2397
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:42,480
your user base right um and so ownership

2398
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,320
of the top level domain let's say

2399
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,960
domain.com doesn't necessarily mean that

2400
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,639
all possible subdomains you know

2401
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:50,480
infinitely under that should be allowed

2402
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,239
as well um at least you know at least it

2403
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:54,480
should be an option to say uh you know

2404
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,639
owning having domain.com verified on

2405
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:59,520
your tenant does not allow

2406
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,480
you to also have you know

2407
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:03,760
a.domain.com it only gives you that top

2408
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:05,600
down you know that top level or whatever

2409
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,840
is explicitly returned rather than

2410
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,679
anything under it as well

2411
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:11,440
uh that way if you have uh you know

2412
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,679
north america in in one sas environment

2413
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:15,679
europe and another apac and another

2414
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:17,120
um you

2415
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:18,960
they're all separated

2416
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:20,400
uh and

2417
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:21,679
ownership of the top level domain

2418
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:24,080
doesn't you know create problems uh if

2419
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,320
it doesn't actually grant the full set

2420
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,480
of uh subdomains under it

2421
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,639
uh and then the the last attribute in

2422
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:32,800
the schema um at least

2423
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,120
outside of some core attributes like id

2424
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,280
would be uh the verified date uh this

2425
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:39,440
one's optional uh

2426
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,920
it's you know an informational piece to

2427
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,760
know how long or you know when was the

2428
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:46,159
domain verified in this service

2429
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:47,280
um

2430
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:48,080
so

2431
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:48,880
yeah

2432
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,639
for use cases where it's uh where it's

2433
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:54,920
valuable uh next slide please

2434
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:57,440
uh here's a quick run through of the

2435
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,360
service router config

2436
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,840
so there's a like a top level boolean of

2437
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:04,400
just supported uh is is the verified

2438
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,560
domains extension uh implemented

2439
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:08,639
uh there's then a

2440
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:09,920
uh complex

2441
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,400
uh attribute of uh username properties

2442
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:15,120
and it has two sub attributes uh and i'm

2443
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,840
not sure if rfc 5321 is the right one to

2444
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:20,239
call so you know anybody want to correct

2445
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:23,040
me go for it um but one is to say does

2446
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,719
the username follow that userat

2447
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:26,719
domain.com format

2448
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:28,560
uh and then the second one is

2449
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:31,199
if it accepts that domain.com format

2450
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:33,120
rather if it requires that it is the

2451
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:36,960
domain suffix required to be verified so

2452
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:40,239
uh this is to allow a skim client to

2453
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:41,679
sort of programmatically or

2454
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:43,600
automatically figure out that it needs

2455
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,280
to act intelligently here and not and

2456
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,840
you know any possible value for username

2457
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,280
isn't acceptable

2458
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:50,800
uh and then

2459
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,280
uh the last attribute and service data

2460
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,840
config is emails verified domain

2461
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,880
required

2462
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,239
and that's essentially the same as that

2463
01:33:58,239 --> 01:34:00,239
second sub bullet point on username

2464
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:03,040
properties uh this game standard says

2465
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:05,679
that uh you know like 76 43 and 44

2466
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:08,000
already calls out that the emails

2467
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,040
dot value attribute uh needs to be in

2468
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:14,000
that rsc 5321 format so it didn't make

2469
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:14,960
sense to

2470
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,120
to make it complex and have advertised

2471
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:18,960
because it should always be true

2472
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:20,480
um but

2473
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,080
the other those two are essentially to

2474
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:24,400
say both for username and for emails uh

2475
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,560
you know two separate attributes uh do

2476
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,600
these require that the domain suffix on

2477
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,719
the username or email value do they need

2478
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:34,719
to be verified

2479
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:36,320
with the service writer

2480
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,960
next slide please

2481
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:42,719
um

2482
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:45,119
so here are some open questions one i

2483
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:47,280
just mentioned is 5321 the correct rc

2484
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:51,119
2.2 for that format um i you know took a

2485
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:52,800
stab at it um i'm sure there'll be more

2486
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,960
revisions of this draft before we try to

2487
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:56,560
you know if we ever try to uh move it

2488
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,000
towards adoption

2489
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,480
um if i'm wrong please let me know

2490
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,880
um for the last subdomains thing uh is

2491
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,360
the purpose of it clear uh should that

2492
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,040
be moved to optional and then guidance

2493
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,679
provided uh specifying that the value if

2494
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:11,920
not provided is assumed to be true so if

2495
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,080
you don't say that sub-domains are not

2496
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,400
allowed just it's assumed that they are

2497
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,239
um i already sort of walked through the

2498
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:21,520
use case of that uh verbally uh and then

2499
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:22,400
i

2500
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,840
had a little bit of trouble when i was

2501
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,600
writing the draft trying to get like

2502
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,440
clear concise language defining things

2503
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:30,960
like uh a domain uh i was i think i used

2504
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:32,800
the term like dns domain something like

2505
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:33,520
that

2506
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,600
um anybody who reviews this if you have

2507
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,840
feedback on how i can make uh any of the

2508
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:40,080
wording clear please i would love to

2509
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,440
talk with you

2510
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:42,719
um

2511
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:44,719
yeah and uh that that's i think about it

2512
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:46,000
for for this

2513
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,520
uh draft if you could uh move to the

2514
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,080
next slide please

2515
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:54,080
and uh if anybody has questions at any

2516
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,520
time just join the queue

2517
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,840
um

2518
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:00,960
pam just joined the queue

2519
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,679
um

2520
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:07,119
do you see a need for a use case where

2521
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:08,159
um

2522
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:10,400
infected the

2523
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:12,239
domain or the you know the owner would

2524
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:13,679
want to define

2525
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:18,000
say three allowed subdomains

2526
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:20,080
the boolean in this case basically says

2527
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:21,840
all or none

2528
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,600
do you see a case where you would want

2529
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:26,560
to actually specify

2530
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:28,719
yes but i think that's achievable with

2531
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:30,480
the current draft

2532
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:33,199
uh so the the boolean would be if if i

2533
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:34,560
have uh

2534
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,719
you know can uh i guess

2535
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:38,320
uh and and maybe the wording in the

2536
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:40,639
draft needs to be refined but uh the the

2537
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:42,000
idea at least

2538
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:42,960
was

2539
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:45,679
that uh

2540
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:46,639
that

2541
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:49,600
it's to say are subdomains of the values

2542
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:51,360
returned allowed

2543
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:54,719
uh so if uh you know domain.com is

2544
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:56,080
what's returned

2545
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:56,960
uh

2546
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:57,760
and

2547
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:59,440
you know all sub domains are not allowed

2548
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,960
then you should only you know you would

2549
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:03,920
say no allow subdomains uh

2550
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:06,159
false and this is on a per resource

2551
01:37:06,159 --> 01:37:08,000
return so every domain return would have

2552
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,560
its own value of for allow sub-domains

2553
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:14,719
but the uh the service writers are good

2554
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:21,280
uh the the service writer um

2555
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:24,400
could alternatively just uh return the

2556
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:26,080
three subdomains so if it was you know

2557
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:29,360
a.domain.com b dot domain c dot domain

2558
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,440
it could return the three sub domains

2559
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:32,239
and

2560
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:34,000
uh explicitly just these are the

2561
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,960
subdomains that are allowed

2562
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:39,440
i uh so essentially what that does is

2563
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:41,760
allows uh or prevents cascading

2564
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,239
subdomain assumptions right

2565
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:46,719
okay i get it

2566
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:48,960
yeah so if if it's everything you can

2567
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,960
just do like domain.com and say allow

2568
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,560
subdomains and they get

2569
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,480
everything underneath uh if it's

2570
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:57,600
specific subdomains then uh rather than

2571
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:00,239
listing the topleveldomain.com you can

2572
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:03,400
just list or return back uh the

2573
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:06,320
subdomain.top you know uh.whatever.com

2574
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:09,040
uh in a list of whatever the the allowed

2575
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,440
ones are

2576
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:13,679
okay

2577
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:17,360
um and so yeah the the second draft um

2578
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,440
sort of aims to solve that same general

2579
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,840
like sassy problem

2580
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,920
of uh

2581
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:25,360
clients

2582
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,119
interacting with skim service providers

2583
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:28,880
want to know

2584
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:31,199
uh like they want to be able to act

2585
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:33,119
intelligently and not waste time

2586
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:34,719
calculating requests that are going to

2587
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:36,960
fail and so the discoverability of

2588
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,080
information

2589
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:38,880
uh

2590
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,560
relevant to whether or not a request

2591
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:43,199
fails is important in my opinion

2592
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:46,560
um and so in this case uh i'm i wrote a

2593
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:49,679
a draft jointly covering uh adding two

2594
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:52,000
new resources uh for roles and

2595
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,600
entitlements and these are meant to

2596
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:56,400
mirror uh acceptable values

2597
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,880
for uh the user resource object for the

2598
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,560
the roles and entitlements attributes in

2599
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,719
the the core schema

2600
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:05,119
um so discovery of the acceptable values

2601
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:06,000
uh

2602
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,280
allows us to

2603
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,239
not

2604
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:11,280
send uh as as the client it allows the

2605
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:14,239
client to not send uh an invalid request

2606
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:14,960
and

2607
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,960
by you know pulling that list back you

2608
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,159
can know okay these are the accepted

2609
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:20,639
values anything else won't work

2610
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:23,760
um and then the ability to discover

2611
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:26,480
uh roles and entitlements uh and what

2612
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,880
values are allowed um

2613
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,719
because they're um this draft is going

2614
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:32,880
to uh go into uh returning them as

2615
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:34,800
complex objects so you know both value

2616
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,000
and display

2617
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,520
it also then gives the clients a little

2618
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:41,199
more flexibility uh in helping

2619
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:41,920
the

2620
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,920
uh like whatever whoever's configuring

2621
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,480
it to uh

2622
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:47,600
assign

2623
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,760
the the roles or entitlements inside of

2624
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,320
the client so that uh they can get the

2625
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,920
correct values on the correct objects in

2626
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,520
the service provider

2627
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,920
uh so the the end state of that being a

2628
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:00,080
client could go and read

2629
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:01,679
uh you know they could do a get on just

2630
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:03,360
the base of slash roles or flash

2631
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,760
entitlements get a full list of uh the

2632
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,920
available values back and then represent

2633
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:09,600
them in a ui somewhere and allow them to

2634
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,960
be uh assigned to uh other resources as

2635
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:15,600
appropriate uh just so there could be

2636
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,760
like a direct mapping of uh

2637
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:20,159
you know of you know these objects get

2638
01:40:20,159 --> 01:40:22,400
this role or what not

2639
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,280
uh next slide please

2640
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:30,960
um yeah so the key components slash

2641
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:33,040
roles slash entitlements and a

2642
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:35,440
servicewriter config to announce

2643
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,760
uh what is available uh next slide

2644
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,000
please

2645
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:45,440
uh the schema i designed it to mostly

2646
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,320
mimic the sub-attributes of the user

2647
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:51,199
resources uh like roles or entitlements

2648
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:53,280
attributes so for both roles and

2649
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,360
entitlements since they share the same

2650
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,119
complex sub-attributes

2651
01:40:57,119 --> 01:40:58,000
um

2652
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:58,719
the

2653
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:00,239
the resources proposed here would have

2654
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:02,800
value display and type

2655
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:05,119
which all originate from the sub

2656
01:41:05,119 --> 01:41:06,800
attributes on the user object

2657
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:09,199
uh as well as one new attribute uh

2658
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:11,280
specific to this uh draft which is

2659
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:14,480
enabled uh which allows the the service

2660
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,960
writer to announce that this role or

2661
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:19,040
entitlement exists but is not currently

2662
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:21,199
in a state that can be used

2663
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:24,159
uh next slide please

2664
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:30,480
uh so here is an example of service

2665
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:31,520
writer

2666
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,520
uh this is mirrored for entitlements so

2667
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,119
you can just sort of uh you know replace

2668
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:37,119
all for the word roles with entitlements

2669
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:39,040
and i i think it applies

2670
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:40,239
um

2671
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:44,400
so uh it's a complex value for uh you

2672
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:47,440
know for roles inside the service config

2673
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:50,400
uh enabled is this uh

2674
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:52,239
is this uh

2675
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:54,560
feature added so we have an enabled for

2676
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,960
roles and enabled for entitlements

2677
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:59,840
uh are multiple roles supported uh some

2678
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:01,440
service providers only allow a single

2679
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,360
value for roles uh whereas some allow

2680
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,679
multiple so uh since the standard uh

2681
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:07,760
today doesn't have an easy way to

2682
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,600
determine that that i'm aware of

2683
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:10,800
uh

2684
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,239
why not include it here

2685
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:13,920
um and then additional just

2686
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:15,440
advertisement of what does the service

2687
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:17,280
writer support uh

2688
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:18,800
the the

2689
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:20,960
7643 uh

2690
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,880
says that uh these sub attributes on

2691
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:25,280
roles are uh optional

2692
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,000
so

2693
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,520
primary and type we um we're allowing

2694
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,360
the service provider to

2695
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:32,800
advertise whether or not they support

2696
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,960
them and all this is just sort of adding

2697
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:37,119
discoverability around these for the

2698
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:39,920
client uh to know how best to interact

2699
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,719
with the service writer that way if they

2700
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:44,080
don't support type or they don't support

2701
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,360
primary

2702
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:46,639
there's no sense in

2703
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:48,000
calculating them and including them in

2704
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,840
the request

2705
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:53,320
next slide please

2706
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:58,880
so open questions on these uh how widely

2707
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:01,119
adopted is the type sub attribute for

2708
01:43:01,119 --> 01:43:02,719
roles and entitlements

2709
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:03,760
um

2710
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:04,719
i

2711
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:07,280
in my own experience which is only one

2712
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:10,239
person uh i've seen implementation of

2713
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:13,199
primary of value and of display i

2714
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:15,119
i'm not sure if i've seen implementation

2715
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:18,320
of type used for roles or entitlements

2716
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:20,800
uh so i'm very curious just on uh what

2717
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,480
implementations are out there

2718
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,400
uh and this raises questions

2719
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,800
uh should be considered uh like if we

2720
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,239
were to include discoverability of

2721
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:31,600
available types because the uh 7643 does

2722
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:34,000
not list any canonical values

2723
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,560
for uh for type for uh roles or

2724
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:37,760
entitlements

2725
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:40,560
should type be advertised uh should the

2726
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:41,840
values that are allowed for type be

2727
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,119
advertised

2728
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:45,679
uh at sort of a a global level so

2729
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:48,239
perhaps in servicewriter config or

2730
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:50,800
should the available types be advertised

2731
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:54,960
on a per role or entitlement value level

2732
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:57,119
um and then

2733
01:43:57,119 --> 01:43:58,880
adding just sort of extra questions here

2734
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:01,040
even though they're not all relevant to

2735
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:03,760
this draft specifically

2736
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:05,360
has there been any implementation of

2737
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,679
type for roles or entitlements uh should

2738
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:10,480
it be should it remain in the core theme

2739
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:11,679
adopt if

2740
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:13,760
uh and this goes back to the question

2741
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,480
that uh that phil had raised earlier uh

2742
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:18,560
if we're just sort of you know uh

2743
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:21,760
giving a once-over on 76.40

2744
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,679
to 43-44

2745
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:24,560
and

2746
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,960
uh sort of uh trying to push it forward

2747
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:29,440
to like a a real standard versus

2748
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,600
proposed um

2749
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:33,119
then we probably can't make that change

2750
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:35,360
but if we're going towards a new rfc

2751
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:36,960
with some major changes you know that

2752
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,880
sort of thing it i think it's a

2753
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,480
worthwhile question of has there been

2754
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:42,560
any implementation of this and as you

2755
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:44,639
know like is there a value in it being

2756
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:45,679
there

2757
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:46,639
um

2758
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:49,440
and then uh there's a question that uh i

2759
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,280
i now have floating around uh based on a

2760
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:53,199
previous conversation i had with phil

2761
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:55,520
uh should this be a standalone extension

2762
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:57,520
or get merged in the course fema docs uh

2763
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:59,760
this again falls to are we just you know

2764
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:02,480
tidying up the existing ones or going uh

2765
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,880
hard on you know making a new one

2766
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:06,000
um

2767
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,040
i i think

2768
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:09,199
from sort of an ease of

2769
01:45:09,199 --> 01:45:11,360
like access thing and the timelines of

2770
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:13,760
how soon can we improve this the

2771
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:16,239
standalone draft makes sense in my

2772
01:45:16,239 --> 01:45:18,159
opinion uh and potentially it could

2773
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:20,880
always be obsoleted later and moved into

2774
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:21,760
uh

2775
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:23,119
if we have you know

2776
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:26,639
a new rfc for skim 3.0 or whatever uh it

2777
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:27,920
could be absolutely didn't move into

2778
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:30,880
that into uh into it then

2779
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,880
but um i'm interested to hear any other

2780
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:34,480
perspectives as well

2781
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:36,639
uh i believe

2782
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:40,000
that is the last slide

2783
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,480
it is

2784
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:44,480
so

2785
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:48,718
we have time for one question

2786
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:57,800
no comments or feedback

2787
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:05,119
right i'm glad you put the uh the

2788
01:46:05,119 --> 01:46:06,960
question at the end danny because that's

2789
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:09,199
what i was gonna ask

2790
01:46:09,199 --> 01:46:10,320
so

2791
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:13,760
it seems again much to what we did with

2792
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:17,199
phil's draft what we can do is

2793
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:21,280
on the mail list ask for interest um

2794
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:24,400
on the actual topics of the two drafts

2795
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,719
before we can sort out whether they

2796
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:29,119
become stand-alone drafts or they become

2797
01:46:29,119 --> 01:46:30,400
part of the core

2798
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:31,520
schema

2799
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:33,840
right

2800
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,760
right

2801
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:38,000
okay well uh

2802
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,719
without any questions i believe it's

2803
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:42,719
back to you nancy

2804
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:43,679
yes

2805
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:45,440
i'm just

2806
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:48,480
making notes for myself all right

2807
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:50,080
thank you danny

2808
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:51,119
all right

2809
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:52,560
so

2810
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:56,880
we're back to procedural stuff

2811
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:59,199
um

2812
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:09,559
let me worry there for a moment

2813
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:14,800
all right so thank you everyone for

2814
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:17,119
putting forward

2815
01:47:17,119 --> 01:47:18,480
draft

2816
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:21,840
proposed concepts i will say so

2817
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:24,960
with that in mind we talked about um

2818
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:27,760
you know putting proposals together that

2819
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:31,520
can serve as documents that we can adopt

2820
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:34,239
um to move forward so

2821
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:36,320
there was a question on the list about

2822
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:38,480
how we could move forward with some of

2823
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:40,639
the tools we talked about it at the

2824
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:42,159
virtual

2825
01:47:42,159 --> 01:47:44,239
interim um

2826
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:47,360
informal session a couple of weeks ago

2827
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:49,600
and i brought up the notion of using

2828
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:50,400
github

2829
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:53,199
a lot of the working groups at the ietf

2830
01:47:53,199 --> 01:47:54,560
um

2831
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:57,600
use that as a way of

2832
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:01,760
openly sharing the work um that the

2833
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,760
working group the documents that the

2834
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:06,320
working group is is focused on

2835
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:08,239
um it also allows us to have that

2836
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:11,199
version control but more importantly for

2837
01:48:11,199 --> 01:48:13,760
myself and the authors and editors of

2838
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,320
the drafts is that we can

2839
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:20,000
interactively and on at live um do the

2840
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,679
issue tracking issue tracking

2841
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:23,040
suggestions

2842
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,360
and pull requests if you will

2843
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:28,639
um the itf has provided guidance i've

2844
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:32,159
put the link in here rfc 8874

2845
01:48:32,159 --> 01:48:35,119
there's a tutorial there as well

2846
01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:38,320
and so as chairs what we can do is

2847
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:40,719
provide a skim

2848
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:43,600
working group repository there um

2849
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,400
typically what we do there

2850
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:48,960
though is that we only

2851
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:51,199
include the documents

2852
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:54,320
that are adopted not the ones that are

2853
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:57,040
proposed

2854
01:48:57,679 --> 01:49:01,199
potentially i could create a sub-repo um

2855
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:04,320
that are for proposed um but i wanted to

2856
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:05,840
to bring that up

2857
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:09,119
to you guys as we work through consensus

2858
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:10,560
so

2859
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:13,920
my proposal is going to be that we use

2860
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,440
github

2861
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:18,480
the other comment i wanted to make here

2862
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:19,840
is

2863
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:22,000
for communication channels and that was

2864
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,239
the other thing that we discussed and i

2865
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:26,639
was going to note details here in slack

2866
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:29,520
but as it turns out the ietf doesn't

2867
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:32,400
really have an official

2868
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:35,199
account for slack that we could use so

2869
01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:38,800
we'd have to ask the question there

2870
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:40,840
for a more interactive

2871
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:44,000
communication style there

2872
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,080
so

2873
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:49,040
that said

2874
01:49:49,199 --> 01:49:52,239
independent of the interactive

2875
01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:55,280
communication channel that being slack

2876
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:58,480
we officially will run

2877
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,560
we meaning the chairs we'll officially

2878
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:01,679
run

2879
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:02,560
the

2880
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:05,040
consensus calls if you will through the

2881
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:07,360
skim mail list so

2882
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,679
i still encourage everyone to use that

2883
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:12,000
mail list for any issues questions

2884
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,560
topics

2885
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:16,480
that we want to raise and also pay

2886
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:18,000
attention there

2887
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,960
as whatever decisions we may make even

2888
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:23,199
in these plenary sessions

2889
01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:27,519
they will get confirmed on the mail list

2890
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:30,719
so i will give

2891
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:32,880
a minute or two

2892
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,719
uh

2893
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:36,639
to see if there are any comments or

2894
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:38,000
feedback

2895
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,119
first on the github

2896
01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:51,239
you guys are very quiet

2897
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:56,239
danny

2898
01:50:57,599 --> 01:51:00,320
not github uh would it just be like

2899
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:03,119
people submit drafts to the itf or is it

2900
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:06,920
all just like decentralized

2901
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:11,679
well you you still have to submit the

2902
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:13,840
working group well all the drafts

2903
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,080
whether proposal or working groups they

2904
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:18,239
do have to be submitted through the ietf

2905
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:19,679
process

2906
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:24,159
but as you're working on the drafts

2907
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,480
and

2908
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:30,159
as we provide comments and create issues

2909
01:51:30,159 --> 01:51:33,280
that we want to address in the drafts

2910
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:36,400
those we can track through github

2911
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:38,719
so the ietf does have an issue tracker

2912
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:41,199
but i think most everyone today uses

2913
01:51:41,199 --> 01:51:42,719
other mechanisms

2914
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:44,880
in the other working groups that i chair

2915
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:47,280
we we use github and that's where we

2916
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:51,440
track the issues a combination of um

2917
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:53,199
of the github as well as on the mail

2918
01:51:53,199 --> 01:51:54,880
list

2919
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:57,599
um so what i'm doing right now as i'm

2920
01:51:57,599 --> 01:52:01,040
seeing people put votes on the chat

2921
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:02,800
um

2922
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:04,000
i've put

2923
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,520
so on the um on the meet echo

2924
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:10,800
you'll see i've started a poll

2925
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,760
to see if we can get

2926
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:16,480
consensus on using github

2927
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:19,199
as our repo

2928
01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:24,480
so

2929
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:25,290
there's a

2930
01:52:25,290 --> 01:52:28,380
[Music]

2931
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:30,719
raise your hand

2932
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:33,199
for yes don't raise your hand

2933
01:52:33,199 --> 01:52:35,678
for no

2934
01:52:36,159 --> 01:52:38,719
oh i have

2935
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:42,960
all right i think we have unanimous

2936
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:46,560
consensus i'll give it 10 more seconds

2937
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:50,320
so danny does that answer your question

2938
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:54,000
yeah like it was already clear that um

2939
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,679
the like final steps would be submitting

2940
01:52:57,679 --> 01:52:59,840
but uh it's more like

2941
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:01,040
it answered the question i was more

2942
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:02,880
talking just about the uh

2943
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:05,199
like before their their fully baked uh

2944
01:53:05,199 --> 01:53:07,119
like you know collaborative review and

2945
01:53:07,119 --> 01:53:08,400
yes

2946
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:09,840
a way to have a

2947
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:10,840
uh

2948
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:12,800
decentralized uh

2949
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:15,440
a more centralized way to uh to collect

2950
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:17,280
all these drafts before they're fully

2951
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:18,560
baked

2952
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:19,520
correct

2953
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:20,639
yeah

2954
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:22,960
and thank you roman he

2955
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:24,800
you put in the link

2956
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:26,560
oh go ahead barry

2957
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:29,280
i just said that when you use when when

2958
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:31,360
a working group uses github it also has

2959
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:32,960
to figure out what the

2960
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:33,760
uh

2961
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:36,639
pace for posting internet drafts to the

2962
01:53:36,639 --> 01:53:38,480
data tracker is

2963
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:40,960
and so you use github

2964
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,440
for the development of the document but

2965
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:45,679
still periodically post drafts

2966
01:53:45,679 --> 01:53:47,280
throughout the process

2967
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:48,960
when you get to a point where you think

2968
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:50,880
it's solid enough that

2969
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:52,880
um a wider community might want to be

2970
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:55,840
looking at it

2971
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:01,040
surprising thank you

2972
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:02,960
yeah

2973
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:05,520
all right so we we seem to have

2974
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:08,000
unanimous consensus everybody's voted

2975
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,360
for github so thank you everyone

2976
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:12,880
for that

2977
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:15,040
um come back to

2978
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:19,080
no i didn't want to stop

2979
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:28,960
okay

2980
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:31,679
so coming back

2981
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:34,560
okay so we've already um put the

2982
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:36,159
question

2983
01:54:36,159 --> 01:54:37,040
for

2984
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:40,000
the repo so i'll go ahead and and create

2985
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,480
the github whenever i can get my laptop

2986
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:44,000
back and running

2987
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,440
um the second question is prior to us

2988
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:50,800
becoming a working group thank you pam

2989
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:53,760
for running the bi-weekly

2990
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:56,719
um informal meetings and i would still

2991
01:54:56,719 --> 01:54:58,239
encourage that

2992
01:54:58,239 --> 01:55:00,239
now it gets to the question of whether

2993
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:03,280
as a working group we want to

2994
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:07,040
have virtual interims

2995
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:08,639
at all

2996
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:12,679
and if we do whether we want to run them

2997
01:55:12,679 --> 01:55:14,239
informally

2998
01:55:14,239 --> 01:55:16,719
meaning as we need it

2999
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:18,719
or whether we want to run it to a

3000
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:22,159
cadence of either every two weeks

3001
01:55:22,159 --> 01:55:25,360
or every four weeks

3002
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:29,199
so while i create the poll

3003
01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:31,519
um

3004
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:35,599
if anybody has comments or feedback

3005
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:41,159
please do so now

3006
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,920
okay i've done the poll before but um

3007
01:55:55,920 --> 01:56:00,199
i thought i could do multiple choice

3008
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:07,360
so i guess we'll we'll first ask the

3009
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:10,480
question go ahead pam

3010
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:15,199
i can't change the question so um the

3011
01:56:15,199 --> 01:56:18,080
first question is

3012
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:20,320
yeah i'm trying to describe the question

3013
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:22,000
too so i'm sorry um

3014
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,440
i think i would love to see us do

3015
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:26,080
virtuals just because a it helps us get

3016
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:28,560
everybody's point of view

3017
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:30,080
into the dock and i think it also just

3018
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:32,880
raises engagement

3019
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,480
okay

3020
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:36,159
yeah so far i've got eight people

3021
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:40,719
responding to the poll positively

3022
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:43,599
to yes we want to continue with virtual

3023
01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:45,119
interims

3024
01:56:45,119 --> 01:56:48,639
and so my next question rather than me

3025
01:56:48,639 --> 01:56:50,239
having a poll

3026
01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:52,480
since i can't do multiple

3027
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:54,718
um

3028
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:56,719
does the group feel

3029
01:56:56,719 --> 01:56:57,920
um

3030
01:56:57,920 --> 01:56:59,679
so honestly from

3031
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:01,760
my being chair perspective

3032
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:04,080
i could probably commit to doing them on

3033
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:06,560
a monthly cadence

3034
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:09,760
um but want to hear feedback as to

3035
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:10,960
whether

3036
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:13,040
there would be objections

3037
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:16,000
to monthly

3038
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:23,520
pam i didn't take you off the cue so

3039
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:27,119
don't know if you have um

3040
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:30,880
i would love i think that's fine

3041
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:33,599
plus one for me

3042
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:36,159
and i'm and i'm really glad that you can

3043
01:57:36,159 --> 01:57:38,400
run them i think it's better for for the

3044
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:41,679
official chair to run them for sure

3045
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:43,599
i don't know about that pam but thank

3046
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:44,560
you

3047
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:46,719
also i'm going to add my vote to the

3048
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:48,800
last poll because i had to dismiss it to

3049
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:51,760
get on the to unmute my mic so i

3050
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:53,119
couldn't respond no

3051
01:57:53,119 --> 01:57:54,239
okay

3052
01:57:54,239 --> 01:57:56,960
um that's right i mean we we've got

3053
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:58,719
you know um

3054
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:02,320
a good amount of interest there

3055
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:03,199
so

3056
01:58:03,199 --> 01:58:05,280
rather than me running a poll i'll just

3057
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:07,360
have people speak up if there are any

3058
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:09,920
objections for us to start running a

3059
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,599
monthly cadence

3060
01:58:11,599 --> 01:58:14,239
and i can do a doodle poll to see

3061
01:58:14,239 --> 01:58:16,799
times

3062
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:21,839
for those as well

3063
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:25,280
okay this actually went faster than i

3064
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:28,480
thought it would um

3065
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:31,840
are there any orders other orders of

3066
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:33,760
business that we need to discuss we

3067
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:37,119
actually have two minutes left

3068
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:44,560
okay so i will raise one um janelle and

3069
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:45,520
danny

3070
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:47,920
talked about the paper cuts and the

3071
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:50,639
things that we want to address

3072
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:53,440
as we evolve the use

3073
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,040
we've already covered the use cases the

3074
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:57,440
schema and the protocol

3075
01:58:57,440 --> 01:58:58,400
um

3076
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:01,520
and danny and phil you provided some of

3077
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:02,560
the work

3078
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:06,719
that you'd like to see get addressed

3079
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:08,560
can i

3080
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:10,320

take the pen

3083
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,320
on a proposal but perhaps i'll take it

3084
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:18,719
up to the working group mail list as

3085

well

3086
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:21,599

3087
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:23,840
discussing the content which we have a

3088
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:25,199
