13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,280
bomb and just everybody reply to me that

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,799
they can hear me fine and then we'll

15
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,400
fill the plenary that way how's that

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,400
right um while we're waiting uh to

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,880
really really get started you uh can

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,320
look at the slide that alexa has

19
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,880
helpfully forwarded um for some tips on

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,799
how to use meet echo which is the system

21
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,119
by which you are joining the session

22
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,280
um so basically you will be muted and

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,880
your video will be off and you need to

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,280
unmute yourself and turn your video on

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,640
when you get into the cube please do

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,320
turn the video on if you can do it at

27
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,240
all i think it's nice

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
to actually see each other in this

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,280
virtual

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,720
future

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,439
if you have a headset you can use one um

32
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,759
i do have one but i prefer not to that's

33
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,640
why i asked whether the audio is okay um

34
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,159
and there's some more details if you get

35
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,320
really bored during this plenary um you

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,799
can click on that link or

37
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,960
copy that link into your browser if it's

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,840
google and uh look at that

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,280
all right i think it's a couple minutes

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,240
uh past 3 30 my time which is in finland

41
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,640

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,799
um my apologies and condolences to all

43
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,318

51
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,080
eggert i'm the itf chair since march of

52
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,680
this year um we have a reasonably um

53
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,720
short agenda this time um which means we

54
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,519
have lots of time for open mic or we can

55
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,080
have a really short plenary as you wish

56
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,040
um

57
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,840
we have the usual uh round of updates

58
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,560
from the various bodies and roles

59
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,640
all of them have published or in the

60
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,239
process of publishing longer written

61
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,599
reports

62
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,680
that are mostly linked to from the itf

63
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,959
report that i shared earlier so you can

64
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,160
find them from there i think there's

65
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,080
also links in the various slide decks

66
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,680
that are going to be shown and then we

67
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,599
have an open mic session as always in

68
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,319
the order of iab itf llc board and the

very short this time um

108
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,400
basically we're going through the usual

109
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
statistics on participation

110
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,080
the plan for future meetings i'm going

111
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,600
to say some things about our currently

112
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,440
running experiments because as we put

113
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,919
together the report um the written

114
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,520
report we realized there's quite a few

115
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,040
of them and maybe not everybody's aware

116
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,320
what's going on

117
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,120
um

118
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,960
there's a already said there's more

119
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,320
topics that we're covering online have

120
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,800
some pointers to that um we have a slide

121
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,520
about um the tools.itf.org transition

122
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,639
and we have a slide about the emoter

123
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,759
activities

124
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,240
next slide please

125
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,280
right so as of uh 2nd of november um

126
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,360
which is not quite today i think

127
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,320
um

128
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,080
we had a 1037 registrations and 210

129
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,560
people used the fee waiver uh 200 people

130
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,560
participated in the hackathon which is

131
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,840
as usual a large number in 17 projects

132
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,800
which again as usual is a large number

133
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,000
the breakdown also unsurprisingly is

134
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,039
pretty us heavy

135
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,960
given that the time zones work like i

136
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,639
would say okayish for it for the u.s

137
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,639
this time and also for europe other

138
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,320
regions of the world unfortunately are a

139
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,560
little bit uh in a difficult situation

140
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,720
but that's why we rotate

141
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,479
um and we're going to post detailed

142
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,160
attendance stats as always after the

143
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,039
meeting

144
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,400
especially since the plenary is

145
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,800
happening before the meeting week so we

146
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,400
are probably going to pick up a few more

147
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
late registrations as we

148
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,400
uh move towards next week next slide

149
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,880
right um future meetings and also for

150
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,600
this meeting if you have any um um

151
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,160

152
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,319

153

154
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,720

155

um you will get triaged to somebody who

156
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,000
can help you

157
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,400
um if you want to specifically talk

158
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,120
about tools um there's a mailing list

159
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,440
that you can join also to be kept the

160
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,720
best of what's happening on the tool

161
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,400
site which is tools discussed at itf.org

162
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,120
we are again going to send out a meeting

163
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,000
after the itf week ends and would ask

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,160
you to fill that out especially since

165
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,919
we're also going to ask for how this

166
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,759
plenary experiment has been going for

167
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,680
you the experiment being that the

168
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,440
plenary is not part of the meeting week

169
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,160
we moved it a week before so we can uh

170
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
open up some working group

171
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,319
slots for the meeting

172
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,080
and then um we have the schmoon working

173
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,479
group in the gen area which um

174
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,880
is busy writing up guidance documents

175
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,080
that informs the um llc and and others

176
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,319
involved in planning the meetings on

177
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,400
some uh guidelines that the community

178
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,680
wants to give them

179
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,440
schmooze rechartering at the moment so

180
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,039
if you haven't paid attention you might

181
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,280
want to drop in next week

182
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,800
and there's a bunch of documents that

183
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,800
are in progress or finished

184
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,560
about what kind of guidance we're giving

185
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,639
and the list is the many couches list at

186
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,479
itf.org

187
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,960
next slide please

188
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,160
so i said we have a bunch of experiments

189
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,080
running um first and foremost i

190
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,599
mentioned the plenary experiment which

191
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,520
is um

192
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,720
the goal is to free up um

193
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,800
session time for working groups during

194
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,400
the itf week

195
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
as you recall in this fully online

196
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,360
format we run shorter days than we do

197
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,199
in an in-person meeting we only have six

198
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,599
hours of meeting time each day and that

199
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,120
really limits the amount of working

200
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,199
groups that we can schedule and since

201
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,960
the plenary is scheduled across all

202
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,599
parallel tracks by moving the plenary

203
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,120
outside the meeting weeks we can free up

204
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,680
i think eight or nine uh session slots

205
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,919
um which i think was very helpful um to

206
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,160
get an agenda that has maybe fewer

207
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,680
conflicts than normal i would

208
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,319
optimistically say if you don't agree

209
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,319
put that in the survey and also put

210
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,840
anything else related to this plenary

211
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,280
experiment and the story that jay's

212
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,360
gonna send out um

213
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,800
i want to apologize to the people at

214
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,360
nanak we dropped the ball on on making

215
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,879
sure that we wouldn't conflict with

216
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,360
anything um i thought we had done it but

217
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,960
apparently we didn't and we missed that

218
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,599
nano is happening this week um hopefully

219
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,720
it's got they're not going to be a

220
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,080
terrible problem but for those of you

221
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,759
that now i'm very sorry that you had to

222
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,680
get up early and then still do the whole

223
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,120
full nanok day after this is over

224
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,160
um

225
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,159
we also are doing an online welcome

226
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,839
reception i think this is the first time

227
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,839
we're doing this in this virtual format

228
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,360
uh which happens right after this

229
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,760
plenary ends um so look at the agenda

230
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,200
and there are links and i think the last

231
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,120
slide of this presentation also has

232
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,519
links um this happens in gather dot town

233
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,279
which you may or may not have joined

234
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,440
which is this sort of virtual forum in

235
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
which you can interact with groups of

236
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
other participants um i think this will

237
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,880
be pretty exciting we're trying to sort

238
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,200
of recreate the actual welcoming section

239
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,440
that we have it in person meetings

240
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,920
um and one part of that uh has been the

241
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
hot rfc session that aaron fox been

242
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,760
running for a while and we're bringing

243
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,839
hot rfc back for this meeting in a

244
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,080
virtual form it's also in gathered up to

245
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,200
town

246
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,880
also after the

247
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,440
plenary ends so um

248
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,200
go and check out there's some some

249
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,279
billboards and people are

250
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,959
going to talk about their proposals for

251
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,600
itf related work um

252
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,720
and i think that should be pretty

253
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,160
interesting i'm happy to see that we

254
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,320
managed to bring that into a virtual

255
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,920
forum

256
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,200
um we're for a number of meetings now um

257
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,399
had the running experiments with

258
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,279
scheduling uh the buff uh deadlines a

259
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,440
little bit differently so that the isg

260
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,200
and iab have the opportunity to give

261
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,600
feedback to the people um preparing

262
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,480
buffs

263
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,800
in sort of the end result hoping that

264
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,720
the buff will be better planned and

265
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,839
better run um if you uh think this is

266
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,600
going well please let us know if you

267
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,040
think you would rather have the one week

268
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,519
or two weeks back uh and we should push

269
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,120
the go back to the single deadline and

270
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,959
move it further back let us know as well

271
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,480
um

272
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,320
at the moment we are running an

273
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,720
experiment in terms of eligibility for

274
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,440
the itf nomcom uh this is defined in rfc

275
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,040
8989

276
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,959
um the reason for this is that the

277
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,079
original noncom eligibility rules

278
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,120
only extend eligibility to people who've

279
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,760
participated in the last three out of

280
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,680
five physical meetings

281
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,959
and since we're not having physical

282
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,600
meetings we decided to count

283
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,360
participation in virtual meetings such

284
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,920
as this one towards non-core eligibility

285
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,519
and there's also different other tracks

286
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,839
by which one can qualify for the numcom

287
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,600
become eligible for the number one as

288
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,079
being a chair and the other one's being

289
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,920
document author of a recent document

290
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,279
we've run that experiment for uh one

291
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,040
cycle already so the

292
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,760
current com ran under that uh

293
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,839
under the extended eligibility

294
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,839
and we published a result

295
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,000
based on it and the isg has decided to

296
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
extend the experiment for another year

297
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,200
which is one of the options in rfc 8989

298
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,040
um the reason being or one reason being

299
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,440
that it was quite unclear why some of

300
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,640
the tracks

301
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,720
um weren't so successful in qualifying

302
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,279
people when they were intended to be

303
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,800
much more successful based on data we

304
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,440
had when rfc 8989 was written

305
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,760
and rather than speculate we decided to

306
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,120
gather more data

307
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,560
the other more pragmatic reason is that

308
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,200
we're still in an all virtual forum so

309
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,480
at the very least

310
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,800
we have to keep counting virtual

311
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,320
attendance or attendance to virtual

312
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,079
meetings as noncom

313
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,680
uh eligibility require

314
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
qualifying uh because otherwise we have

315
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,959
trouble sitting in nom come next year

316
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,680
and finally the isg has decided to do an

317
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,760
experiment of doing sort of a 360 degree

318
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,839
reviews for ads

319
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,839
and we just got the

320
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,720
first set of results basically we asked

321
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,560
each other we asked the iab we asked the

322
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,800
secretariat we asked our chairs and uh

323
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,600
document authors as well as um

324
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,920
other document also that we balloted on

325
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
uh to sort of give us feedback in sort

326
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,959
of a set of short web forms um we got

327
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,240
some interesting feedback from the

328
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,760
community that we should revamp the

329
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,079
questionnaire if we do this again which

330
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,480
will take into account but i still think

331
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,240
we got some personally i would say i got

332
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,920
some interesting data out of this so the

333
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
idea is that every ad gets their own

334
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,800
review um and and it's not shared with

335
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,120
the rest of the isg the entire isg gets

336
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,279
sort of an aggregated view which

337
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,959
averages all the individual feedback and

338
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,680
that aggregate view um we're planning on

339
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,440
publishing since we just got it this

340
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,600
might take a week or two

341
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,440
but you can then all see what the

342
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,600
feedback was on on the isg as a whole

343
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,120
and that's about the currently running

344
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,639
experiments next slide

345
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,360
please right we had zero appeals which

346
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,519
is uh great as usual and we published

347
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,360
one isg statement which is the

348
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,079
aforementioned report on the rfc 8989

349
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,160
experiment uh it has a bunch of data in

350
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,399
it so if you're wondering exactly why we

351
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,079
are continuing it please give that a

352
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,240
read if you haven't already

353
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,959
and there are much more reports that i

354
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,600
go into detail online

355
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,519
on the data tracker materials page for

356
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,440
this meeting and as always there's an

357
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,600
itr blog that greg is

358
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,920
filling with interesting content so if

359
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,399
you wonder what's going on that's a good

360
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,480
source to take a peek at as well

361
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,360
next slide please

362
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,079
okay about tools so um

363
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,000
there was an announcement in may that

364
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,519
the services that are currently running

365
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,079
at the tools.itf.org url are being

366
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,240
replaced and we're going to wind that

367
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,240
down uh it's probably going to happen

368
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,839
before itf 113. the original goal was to

369
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,320
do it before this itf but it was a bit

370
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,880
more complex than was anticipated and so

371
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,040
we removing that by a meeting

372
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,079
um

373
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,279
there's a few uh um tools that are sort

374
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,720
of um

375
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,279
still waiting to be replaced probably

376
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,120
um the xml to rfc uh page

377
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,199
is the most visible of those there's an

378
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,959
authors.idf.org

379
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,120
beta that you can take a look at which

380
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
is intending to replace this

381
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,560
but we need still need to do a little

382
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,320
bit of work on the bibxml and the

383
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,480
conversion service before that's fully

384
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,360
there

385
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,519
um there's a whole uh

386
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,639
slew of other tools that were

387
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,000
made available under tools.itf.org

388
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,600
for almost all um that have a sort of

389
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,800
sizable

390
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,320
community that uses them we have a

391
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,560
transition plan there's a github url

392
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,480
here that that you can take a look at

393
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
but i also want to be clear that we we

394
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,320
can't maintain all tools that were under

395
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,000
tools.itf.org going forward um because

396
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,160
we have limited resources and some of

397
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,320
the tools specifically written

398
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
um oftentimes for a very small community

399
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,519
i think we have one or two tools that

400
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,800
were specifically written for one

401
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,000
participant

402
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,519
and and i hope it's clear that we are

403
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,040
not going to be able to maintain those

404
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,800
going forward but we're going to try our

405
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,040
best and if you have feedback on on the

406
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,160
plan please go to that github page and

407
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,800
open issues or send emails to tools

408
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,240

directory called imorder which is um

412
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,040
the new home for the edgier team

413

step down as a co-coordinator so i

420
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,079
really want to thank joey for the

421

contribution she's made to uh

422
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,839
immediately over

423
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,600
the years

424
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,800

i also want to mention that we're

426
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,079
probably looking for another co-chair of

427
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,600
this so if you're interested in helping

428

during these uh virtual corona times

441
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
it's been sort of limited what we were

able to

443

uh offer as a services um but we're

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,639
meetings sometime next year and that

446
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,120
would also mean that we're gonna ramp up

447
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,160
these activities again

448
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,880

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,039
to the next slide

471
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,039
yeah i just want to take um this

472
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,440
opportunity here in the admin primary to

473
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,520
do a couple of announcements

474
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,160
so one is about a workshop that the iab

475
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,480
is holding end of november and this

476
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,039
workshop is focusing on analyzing ietf

477
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,480
data so what we want to do here is to

478
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,080
bring together the researchers and

479
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,919
engineers that are working already on

480
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,039
looking at like for example

481
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,640
participation trends

482
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,280
um and or author trends or author groups

483
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,200
and these kind of things and bringing

484
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,880
everybody in the room understanding what

485
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
we know about the ietf already and what

486
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,280
else we can learn from the data i'm sure

487
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,120
there will be some interesting insights

488
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,720
about what happened during the last two

489
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,280
years what changed during the pandemic

490
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,360
and so the workshop the call for

491
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,200
position tape is already over so the

492
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,880
workshop is kind of

493
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,600
moving forward um but we're planning

494
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,840
to of course record the sessions and

495
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,679
putting them available after the

496
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,840
workshop and also nice thing about this

497
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,600
workshop is that we are planning for

498
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
having discussion sessions on monday and

499
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,520
thursday and then actually have some

500
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,840
time for hacking in between so maybe we

501

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,640
actually driven by the community

511
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,840

534
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,280
another announcement uh is that adrian

535
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,080
farrell is decided to step down as the

536
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,640
independent submission editor

his term will end in february um next

538
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,679
year

539
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:02,720
and

540
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,640
we probably have another chance to thank

541
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,320
him at the next meeting in march and

542
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,760
hopefully in person

543
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,240
um but i already want to say very much

544
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,159
thank you to adrian i think he has done

545
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,480
a great job in this position by um

546
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,799
trying to to make sure that like all

547
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,559
voices are heard in our community and

548
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,200
discussion is ongoing and like also i

549
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,960
talked to him and he said he's kind of

550
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,320
also um

551
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,919
working a lot with newcomers and

552
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,600
providing it right advice to them so in

553
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,960
that sense i think this is a really

554
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,039
important position and he has done a

555
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,600
very good job and is very encouraged and

556
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,360
cares a lot about this so thanks a lot

557
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,720
adrian

558
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,080
um but he decided to step down and make

559
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,000
some room for somebody new

560
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,919
um so we're looking for candidates right

561
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,120
now

562
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,720
as i said i think this is a very

563
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,039
important position in our community

564
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,320
and i think it can also be very

565
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,679
interesting of course there is a little

566
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,440
bit of work here to do

567
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,159
but if you're interested please let us

568
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,200
know

569
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,679
i think adrian is also available to talk

570
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,440
to if you want to learn more about this

571
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,960
because he has all the first-hand

572
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,720
information i can probably only point

573
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,520
you to the rc where this role is defined

574
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,360
if you reach out to me

575
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,280
but i believe adrian is also available

576
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,600
for questions so please consider this

577
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,520
position

578
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,200
okay and then

579
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,600
we go to my last slide

580
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,080
um this is also uh the point where i

581
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,919
want to thank you some of our community

582
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,400
members who have taken up some roles

583
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,960
um we just seated somebody new on the

584
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,919

585
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,520
committee

586
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,840

587
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,039
candidates and vittorio batala is taking

588

590
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,240

people thanks a lot a lot for that

592
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,280

600
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,799
down in this position and we finally

601
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,559

611
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400

612
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,480
every year are looking for a new person

613
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,919
for the um icefox board of trustees

614
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,919
um so far richard bruns was serving in

615
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,400
this position and he reached

616
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,720
his term limit after six years so thanks

617
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,400
a lot richard for serving in this

618
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,640
position so we are looking for a new

619
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,919
candidate

620
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,080
um again this is the position that has a

621
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,159
real-time commitment and but it's also

622
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,440
very interesting position i think um you

623
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,200
uh learn a lot about what's what's

624
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,360
happening in isoc and you can actually

625
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,520
also um impact there

626
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,840
and uh we as the iab serve as the

627
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,480
interface to isoc so we actually do

628
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,400
get a lot of input about what isoc is

629
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,679
doing i personally find it very

630
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,400
interesting

631
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,640
i don't have all this knowledge about

632
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,799
the politics behind but it's always good

633
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,480
to understand what what's happening in

634
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,960
policy and and what other views are so

635
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,640
this is really definitely something

636
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,840
where eyesock is important

637
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,000
we are we are really looking for you to

638
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,080
put your name in last time we had a very

639
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,600
good set of candidates i think we had

640
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,080
like eight or ten candidates um but

641
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,000
diversity of that set of people was

642
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,039
really really low so it was really um

643
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,200
just people from the u.s it was only

644
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,679
male people and it was only white people

645
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,880
um so um icelock is discussing diversity

646
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,559
a lot and they try to fill their board

647
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,159
with a diverse set of people because

648
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,080
isaac has like all the chapters very

649
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,200
international as well um but i think we

650
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,360
should also support them in trying to to

651
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,880
provide them a more

652
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,559
diverse candidate than we had in the

653
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,240
past maybe

654
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,200
um so i'm i'm really looking for people

655
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,760
to nominate their self or maybe think

656
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,520
about people who would serve very well

657
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,600
in this position and ping them try to

658
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,000
convince people to put their name in i

659
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,840
would definitely like to see

660
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,840
more women applying and i think we

661
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,679
should also figure out how to get more

662
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,840
people from other regions interested in

663
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,080
participating in this work

664
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,440
so um

665
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
the call just opened yesterday it will

666
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
be open until january and please put

667
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,039

applied networking research

686
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,600
to try and highlight some

687
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,840
interesting new research ideas that are

688
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,080
potentially of relevance to the internet

689
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,600
standards community

and to try and highlight the work of

692
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,520
upcoming people that are likely to have

693
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,039
an impact on

694
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,120

whatever bodies and people will replace

774
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,039
the former rfc editor so i'm i'm

775
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,240
sort of i'm keeping keeping the

776
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,320
documents flowing next document please

777
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,678
next yes next page please

778
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
we have been publishing rfcs and xml for

779
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,120
a year and a half we publish 461 of them

780
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,720
the process is working pretty well i

781
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
mean there's some nits the pdfs page

782
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,240
breaks still aren't beautiful but the

783
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,559
html and text versions are working

784
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,840
pretty well

785
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,720
um

786
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,480
and again since the

787
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,320
since the process is the xml is

788
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,000
canonical and the rendered versions are

789
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,520
not as we improve the rendering we can

790
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,960
fix it

791
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
it took a while for the production

792
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
people to learn the ins and outs of xml

793
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,399
but they have done so

794
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,159
um we are back to the service level

795
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,600
agreement that we had before and they're

796
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,520
meeting the service level agreement um

797
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,320
so

798
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,919
so although they're putting more work

799
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,799
into it they stepped up so that rfcs are

800
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,399
now being published as fast as they were

801
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,399
before we switch to xml

802
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,879
next please

803
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,840
um what i'm still trying to work on are

804
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,600
the tools i mean

805
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,240
the uh a lot of drafts are still being

806
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,720
being submitted in version 2 xml even

807
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
though v3 is what we publish in and v3

808
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
is in fact stable and usable some of the

809
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,399
tools aren't complete um i have the

810
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,240
discussions about like do we need to do

811
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,760
we need an xml diff do we need other

812
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,200
tools to make it

813
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,360
to make us svg work better and things

814
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,320
like that

815
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,760
um we we're also having a lot of

816
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,360
discussions i mean a lot of people write

817
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,120
stuff in markdown do we want to do we

818
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,640
want to support markdown tools that have

819
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,799
an entire markdown

820
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,480
um tool chain

821
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,159
we're also doing some experiments in

822
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,039
auth 48 anybody who's done an rfc notice

823
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,360
that in in in auth 48 there's a great

824
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,120
deal of email back and forth between the

825
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,960
authors and the editors

826
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,360
um confirming the changes and and and

827
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,279
approving stuff that there's clearly

828
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,480
room for automation there we've been

829
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,080
doing some experiments in github for

830
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,600
people who like github

831
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,840
uh and as i said we also might want to

832
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,159
advance and and we might want to change

833
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,120
and do

834
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,840
and make markdown and an alternative

835
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,279
input this is all stuff that we're still

836
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,480
looking at

837
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,039
next please

838
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,080
um

839
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,120
when we went from v2 to v3 um the v3

840
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,279
vocabulary was known to be sort of

841
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,600
retentive we expected some changes um

842
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,360
the changes have all been pretty small

843
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,919
and with one change about except for one

844
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,440
chain for postal addresses everything is

845
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,240
going to be

846
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,760
is going to be backwards compatible so

847
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,919
if you use the vocabulary described in

848
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,600
rfc 7991 that's valid that will work

849
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,399
um

850
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,399
when when we back out some of the postal

851
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,120
changes um i this is something i need to

852
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,399
discuss with the community but i would

853
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,159
like to reissue the xml changing the

854
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,880
codes not the text but the codes so that

855
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,640
all of the canonical xml actually

856
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,840
matches the final version of the

857
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,200
vocabulary

858
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,679
and we also have a lot of issues with

859
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,519
svg it turns out we backed the wrong

860
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,320
horse the diver the the profile of svg

861
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,399
we use is one that's it's nobody uses

862
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,000
it's abandonware

863
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,159
and the tools have we have trouble

864
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,679
producing xvg that matches our profile

865
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,120
and the question is do we need to change

866
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,559
the tools or change the profile or

867
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,039
something um so we're talking about that

868
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,360
so the svg subset will likely change too

869
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,799
but again this is a this is a minor

870
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,640
evolution you know if you

871
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,559
lots of people have produced got

872
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,799
reproduced rfcs with perfectly good svg

873
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,679
both line diagrams and equations

874
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,640
um

875
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,919
next please and i think that's it

876
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,720
yep so thank you

877
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,519
hello um so my name is gabriel

three slides of which two really are

882
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,960
content the first and foremost is uh i

883
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,880
need we need feedback uh there was a

884
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,320
recent

885
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,480
call for community feedback that i sent

886
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,600
out uh this is a continuation of that

887
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,840
we need feedback here's a very very easy

888
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,720
way

889
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,159
uh go to this link on the data tracker

890
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,080
non-com slash 2021 slash feedback

891
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,159
you click on that you'll see the names

892
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,799
of all the nominees you can click on all

893
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,720
the names or

894
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,880
the names you know better provide

895
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,919
feedback on them there's also a quote

896
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,799
unquote topics at the very bottom of

897
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,000
that page

898
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,080
don't miss it if you have feedback that

899
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,320
is not specific to any given

900
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,919
nominee you can provide it there

901
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:06,960
but

902
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,799
be mindful of the scope

903
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,399
this is feedback

904
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,919
that is useful to the non-con 2021 it's

905
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,240
not general feedback it's not a general

906
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,440
discussion

907
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,880
uh facility

908
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,480
uh basically

909
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,559
this stems out from the fact that all of

910
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,760
this is

911
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,240
highly confidential this will only be

912
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,279
shared and seen within the nom-com

913
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,960
there are 17 members you can see them on

914
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,279
the knock-on page who they are

915
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,120
so these are the only people who will

916
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,720
see that feedback

917
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,840
so of course again don't think that the

918
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,440
general or topics capability is a it's a

919
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,600
general uh discussion for that you can

920
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,159
go to other venues like you know the itl

921
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,399
mailing list or wherever

922
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,000
so please help us reflect the community

923
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,799
give us feedback i would be remiss uh

924

1004
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,560
with um running the network for the

1005
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,200
in-person meetings um so we'll begin to

1006
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,400
start seeing that

1007
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,040
uh usually and hopefully next year

1008
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,599
next slide please

1009
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,320
um so thank you to the other um 112

and inclusivity sponsors akamai and

1012
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,160

1013
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,720
next slide please

1014
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,800
and to our silver diversity and

1015
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,960
inclusivity sponsor huawei and to our

1016
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,079

1017
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,280
sponsors comcast and donuts and to our

1018
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,760
running code sponsor cnn nick

1019
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,040
as you'll see our new set of

1020
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,520
sponsorships

1021
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,079
bring about

1022
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,640
a substantial amount of

1023
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,520
ongoing support from these companies

1024
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,280
because i think we've managed to get the

1025
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,640
point where we're aligning with the

1026
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,880
values of these organizations well and

1027
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,040
people are comfortable supporting us

1028
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,480
thank you next slide please

1029
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,800
so thank you to the many generous

1030
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,880
volunteers who make this happen

1031
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,440
we had a code sprint last week focused

1032
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,560
on

1033
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,119
performance of the data tracker and we

1034
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,839
had lots of people involved there

1035
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,520
looking hard at that stuff so thank you

1036
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,200
very much for that

1037
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,440
and thank you to the knock who continued

1038
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,280
to provide our significant support such

1039
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,119
as during this meeting and thank you

1040
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,359
particularly to their employers who

1041
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,839
provide their time to us for free for us

1042
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,920
to for them to work on

1043
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,000
ietf related things that's very generous

1044
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,119
of them

1045
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,680
next slide please

1046
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,359
um so i'm going to go through all here

1047
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,359
but i've listed out all everyone who's

1048
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,640
part of the team that hasn't been

1049
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,640
thanked so far so we have the

1050
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,520
secretariat team we have the not

1051
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,480
contractors meet echo which is um

1052
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,680
obviously crucial for us we have the llc

1053
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,520
staff which have grown a little bit and

1054
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,680
we have the um contracting members of

1055
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,599
the tools team so thank you very much

1056
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,000
for everyone for making this a success

1057
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,359
next slide please

1058
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,160
um

1059
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,960
so

1060
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,040
ietf113

1061
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,240
we are

1062
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,040
close to negotiating a new venue for

1063
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,000
this

1064
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,640
all i can tell you so far is that um it

1065
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,359
is going to be in europe we

1066
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,760
have had to move away from bangkok due

1067
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,960
to the

1068
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,720
covert situation there

1069
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,480
we've been unable to find any other

1070
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,079
alternative venue

1071
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,880
in asia due to largely um

1072
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,760
restrictions on travel and in some cases

1073
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,640
due to the state of the pandemic there

1074
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,720
we've also similarly had to rule out

1075
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,599
north america due to travel restrictions

1076
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,079
and we've therefore been working on

1077
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,800
europe for some time now of course it's

1078
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,720
likely by march that many of the travel

1079
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
restrictions will have changed for those

1080
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,560
um other regions but that's not

1081
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,480
something we can take the risk on we

1082
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,319
need to know now and so we've been

1083
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,560
working um in a number of countries in

1084
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,400
europe and we are close

1085
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,800
to being able to sign somewhere and give

1086
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,560
you good news about that

1087
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,240
um so that

1088
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,240
i think will hopefully be the first

1089
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,839
meeting that we're all able to have

1090
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,760
together we're aiming for a smaller

1091
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,520
meeting than normal

1092
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,800
probably capping out around 650 people

1093
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,800
rather than what might be sort of an

1094
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,280
1100 plus meeting which we think is

1095
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,200
reasonable given the um

1096
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,720
reluctance that some people will still

1097
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,000
have to travel and the practical

1098
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,400
difficulties that some people will still

1099
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,760
feature um still struggle with and then

1100
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,280
but then we're going to ramp up again

1101
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,720
for the middle of the year and later in

1102
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,800
the year for the meetings to

1103
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,640
enable us to get back to

1104
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,040
normal sized meetings again relatively

1105
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,800
soon we hope

1106
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,599
next slide please

1107
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,200
and so finally thank you to all of our

1108
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,839
global hosts so our global hosts make a

1109
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,000
commitment to us of

1110
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,560
generally six years where they agree to

1111
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,359
fund us throughout those six years and

1112
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,160
to

1113
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,960
sponsor one or to be the host meeting

1114
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,720
host for at least one meeting or two

1115
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,720
meetings during that period of time so

1116
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,920
these people have made long-term

1117
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,359
commitments to us and many of them have

1118
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,920
been making some years having renewed

1119
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,640
um at least once so thank you to cisco

1120
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,359
comcast ericsson huawei juniper nbc

1121
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,920
universal and nokia

1122
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,800
next slide please

1123
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,760
so this is all we have so far about the

1124
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,760
future um meeting locations and venues

1125
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,960
we

1126
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,560
we are we as you'll notice we have a

1127
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,880
number of slots open um one in 2022 um

1128
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,760
in

1129
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,000
november we are close to negotiating

1130
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,839
somewhere for that

1131
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:56,160
the asia slots in 116 um

1132
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,000
itf one or six we're also close to

1133
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,079
negotiating someone there that the

1134
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,680
reason we haven't done those is that

1135
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,960
generally we

1136
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,280
need to do site visits and we need the

1137
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,760
hotels to be up and operational and

1138
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,400
functional for us to do business with

1139
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,119
them and um the hotels have really only

1140
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,640
started coming back on stream in the

1141
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,240
last few months so um that has been

1142
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,119
problematic um until now and for mike's

1143
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,640
comment in the chat to know the dates

1144
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,079
haven't changed those are still the same

1145
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:26,960
dates

1146
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,880
um we did look at changing the dates to

1147
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,720
see whether that helped availability but

1148
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,640
there was no reason to do that and so no

1149
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,119
we haven't changed that

1150
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,359
and then looking further you'll see that

1151
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,880
we've rebooked vancouver later on and

1152
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,520
my tf-119 of course we've had an asian

1153
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,960
cancellation that we're looking to try

1154
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,760
to rebook as well so this

1155
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,359
schedule should hopefully fill up quite

1156
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,240
soon

1157
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,439
thank you next slide please

1158
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,440
registration numbers uh for ietf formula

1159
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,560
12 as of the 2nd of november we're doing

1160
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,359
quite well here as you'll see um

1161
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,160
the

1162
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:04,960
uh

1163
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,200
we're generally quite um conservative

1164
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,960
about our estimates and um

1165
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,720
we are getting better and better about

1166
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,560
these these are coming in quite close to

1167
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,280
our expected numbers if you take the fee

1168
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,160
waivers off the um the budget it

1169
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,000
generally works out quite well for us

1170
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,680
and particularly want to thank those

1171
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,480
people who we know who deliberately wait

1172
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,800
to register until there's a late fee so

1173
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,200
that they can pay us more to support us

1174
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,200
thank you very much for that

1175
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,000

nick works the lives the word engineer

1190

the word engineer for him so but

1192
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,119

1203
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,760
berkeley shaw and i'm the new director

1204
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,319
of development at ietf llc

1205
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,839
i've been charged with overseeing

1206
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,440
fundraising activities with special

1207
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,520
emphasis on the endowment

1208
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,920
i've been here a little over four months

1209
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,440
and while i've met with some of you i

1210
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,960
look forward to getting know getting to

1211
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,640
know you all better and hopefully in

1212
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,160
person soon

1213
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,920
i wanted to take a brief opportunity to

1214
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,400
mention the ietf endowment for those who

1215
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,079
don't know it was originally set up in

1216
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,680
2012 and the iutf llc assumed the legal

1217
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,960
and administrative home in 2018. the

1218
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,880
endowment is a designated investment

1219
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,160
fund created in support of the itf and

1220
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,640
its activities and it is intended to

1221
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,560
ensure the long-term sustainability of

1222
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,839
the ietf this is really important as the

1223
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,760
sponsorships and registrations

1224
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,839
associated with the meetings essentially

1225
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,960
cover those costs of hosting them and as

1226
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,200
such ietf is currently being supported

1227
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,200
almost exclusively not entirely but

1228
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,680
almost by the internet society and as

1229
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,280
many of you know our relationship with

1230
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,920
isoc is strong and we hope to have that

1231
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,079
our support long into the future but

1232
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,480
it's not prudent for any organization to

1233
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,520
be solely dependent on any single entity

1234
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,599
the hope is that this endowment will

1235
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,079
allow a home for a variety of donors and

1236
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,000
thanks to both a generous pledge of

1237
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,480
matching funds by the internet society

1238
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,319
and the interest accrued over time in

1239
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,839
the endowment

1240
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,560
it will help diversify ietf financially

1241
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,480
and ultimately help us become

1242
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,800
financially independent

1243
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,400
in my short time here i've been meeting

1244
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,800
with the community to learn about what

1245
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,119
you see as priorities and how you see

1246
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,040
the future for the organization

1247
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,200
my hope is that the endowment will allow

1248
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,040
us to make some of those goals a reality

1249
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,119
over time

1250
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,680
as such i'm very pleased to announce

1251
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,599
that we have a new gift to the ietf

1252
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,079
endowment as of september of this year

1253
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,319
lachnik the internet registry for latin

1254
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,400

1255
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,920

for them we're so pleased um and they

1258
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,520
join aaron and ripe as key donors and

1259
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,359
their gift will be matched two to one by

1260
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,520
the internet society

1261
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,440
this is really exciting and we hope this

1262
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,280
will be the first of many gifts coming

1263
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,480

session next slide

1313
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,920
so what's the current work that we're uh

1314
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,839
doing since the last meeting a few

1315
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:52,880
things

1316
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,040
first and foremost um i'll be speaking

1317
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,359
to this later on we've completed the isa

1318
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,920
ii three-year retrospective

1319
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,920
and i'll have some more slides on that

1320
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,520
uh in a bit

1321
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,640
uh we also completed a consultation on

1322
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,359
the llc role requirements that we send

1323
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,680
to the nom com that was some feedback

1324
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,760
that we had received from the prior

1325
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,839
years in oncom and so we put that out to

1326
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,920
community comment

1327
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,000
over the past few months and then sent

1328
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,160
the updated requirements over to the

1329
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,559
nom-com in august i don't think there

1330
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,160
were any major changes there perhaps

1331
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,760
just these minor tweaks

1332
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,520
item number three

1333
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,359
this is an interesting one that just

1334
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,960
came up um

1335
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,800
one or two board meetings ago you know

1336
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,440
we've only just adopted an investment

1337
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,559
policy

1338
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,880
but our advisor goldman sachs has

1339
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,920
recommended potential changes to those

1340
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,559
um and we'll be considering those we've

1341
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,319
started to look at their their

1342
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,400
recommendations and we're going to

1343
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,119
at the next board meeting um

1344
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,880
in december

1345
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,280
um have an independent

1346
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,119
you know advisor kind of facilitate a

1347
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,119
discussion and there are two things

1348
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:04,240
which are notable that they're

1349
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,760
recommending one

1350
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,000
they've recommended that we increase our

1351
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,160
allocation or exposure to equity

1352
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,680
investments

1353
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,920
to be perhaps a bit more

1354
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,960
aggressive

1355
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,480
from that standpoint

1356
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,800
but number two have recommended that we

1357
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,800
consider adding private equity

1358
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,079
investments

1359
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,400
and to date we focus really on low-cost

1360
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,480
investments with the idea that you know

1361
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,079
we can't really beat the market but we

1362
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,240
can control our cost of investing and so

1363
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,400
if we can keep those costs slow

1364
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,079
um you know that's a way to you know

1365
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,920
egap better returns

1366
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,520
in this case you know private equity is

1367
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,839
certainly less liquid and higher cost

1368
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,240
from a fees standpoint but potentially

1369
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,880
offers higher returns

1370
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,119
we're not sure you know we're just

1371
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,800
learning about the recommendations and

1372
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,960
plan to dive into that a bit more

1373
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,720
you know i think you know no change is

1374
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,200
is the most likely default position here

1375
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,359
meaning we've you know just a year or so

1376
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,839
adopted the investment policy statement

1377
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,599
um but we're looking at it nonetheless

1378
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,760
because they are the advisors and and

1379
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,040
you know we're willing to listen to

1380
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,040
whatever they recommend

1381
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,359
and consider it so stay tuned for that

1382
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:14,319
um

1383
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,319
and we'll see what happens

1384
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,640
and then of course item number four

1385
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,920
um lots of work with the with jay as the

1386
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,440
executive director

1387
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,839
you know the secretary at isg

1388
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,319
iabi rtf and so on

1389
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,640
knock team um you know the different

1390
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,400
technical vendors to see

1391
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,079
what we need to do to get ready for our

1392
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,480
first hybrid meeting in march

1393
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,800
again nice to have a bit more time than

1394
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,800
when the pandemic first struck to have

1395
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,040
that transition to online only

1396
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,359
so uh you know some some work is going

1397
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:46,800
in there mostly around you know the

1398
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,960
contracting and support for any

1399
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,559
technical investments that might be

1400
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,000
needed next slide please

1401
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,880
so this is the view of the current

1402
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,760
operating budget um really the notable

1403
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,280
thing here is that the current net

1404
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,319
income

1405
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,559
is solely a result of the

1406
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,680
isoc funding the timing of that

1407
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,920
um and so that

1408
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,800
investment comes uh in december i

1409
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,559
believe so you know the numbers look

1410
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:15,440
better

1411
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,960
what we'll plan to do next year uh is to

1412
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,319
account for that a bit differently in

1413
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,800
the budget so that it it doesn't show up

1414
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,280
oddly as we explained earlier in this

1415
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,960
fiscal year

1416
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,839
the way that that got accounted for was

1417
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,599
a bit unexpected and we had to sort

1418
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,160
through that issue with our accountants

1419
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,240
and so we'll present that in a

1420
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,559
an easier to understand way for next

1421
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,880
fiscal year which means that you know

1422
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,200
this uh timing of that one

1423
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,000
large investment will be

1424
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,240
you know more apparent in the budget and

1425
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,800
won't show these distortions up until

1426
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,880
the moment of that investment

1427
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,440
next slide

1428
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,760
so these are all the ways you can get in

1429
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,040
contact with us

1430
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,319
no changes there next slide

1431
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,520
all right so let's do a very quick

1432
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,359
review of the iasa 2 retrospective next

1433
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,680
slide

1434
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,960
so a three-year retrospective was

1435
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,559
required by

1436
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:21,200
bcp 101 so that was rfc 8711 that was

1437
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,240
adopted as part of the iasa 2

1438
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,040
you know sort of list of documents

1439
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,520
in april we proposed a high-level

1440
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,000
process for this and a timeline

1441
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,040
um and uh you know asked for feedback

1442
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,880
starting then in june we began the

1443
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,440
consultation process by first releasing

1444
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,720
a draft

1445
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,960
document for comment asking a bunch of

1446
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,599
very specific questions as well as

1447
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,599
general ones

1448
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,839
and then in the june to september time

1449
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:50,720
frame

1450
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,880
we made a number of revisions to that

1451
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,280
assessment based on community input

1452
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,960
and then we've just

1453
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,119
released a final report

1454
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:01,280
and so you can take a read through that

1455
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,680
lots of details in there

1456
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,200
we'll touch on some of them here next

1457
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,520
slide

1458
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,960
so the feedback mechanisms that we

1459
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,599
included were a number of these this is

1460
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,599
to some extent reflective of the fact

1461
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,839
that you know mailing lists alone are

1462
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,319
not um sufficient for getting feedback

1463
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,480
in the community so we did a mailing

1464
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,440
list

1465
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,440
so admin discuss

1466
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,480
we had

1467
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,480
all the documents posted on github so

1468
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,240
people could do pull requests or open

1469
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,200
issues

1470
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,160
we held two live webinars for q a

1471
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,920
and then we held itf 111 meeting office

1472
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,640
hours of course we also you know opened

1473
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,400
up regular board meetings for comments

1474
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,520
as well next slide

1475
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,680
so we had 63 specific

1476
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,520
enumerated requirements 61 of those were

1477
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,960
rated as achieved or on track

1478
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,440
two we were noting here as partly

1479
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,839
achieved or in progress

1480
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:04,480
and those specifically were requirements

1481
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,040
number 50 and 61. so

1482
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,680
improve the ietf's technical environment

1483
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,920
and develop a sustainable funding model

1484
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,799
next slide please

1485
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,400
so on that first requirement 50 improve

1486
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,880
the technical environment i think the

1487
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,880
conclusion there is that much technical

1488
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,280
debt remains i think we're all aware of

1489
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,440
that in the community and we can all see

1490
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,799
as lars mentioned

1491
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,319
a number of the

1492
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:31,920
transitions that are happening and

1493
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,000
focuses on you know improving

1494
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,599
performance and

1495
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,760
you know up resourcing the development

1496
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,920
um folks that have been brought on and

1497
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,119
so on

1498
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,240
um and you know in essence you know the

1499
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,079
llc has provided the

1500
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,079
executive director with whatever

1501
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,880
financial resources are necessary um to

1502
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,440
fill out the team working on that um and

1503
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,760
provide whatever resources the folks in

1504
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,760
the community that are working on that

1505
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,000
might need and so you know we expect

1506
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,520
more to come but

1507
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,960
you know i think

1508
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,119
looking at it at a very high level it's

1509
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,040
clear that not only is there a lot of

1510
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,799
technical debt but the community is

1511
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,359
really in the midst of a transition to

1512
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:14,079
you know maybe newer and updated um you

1513
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,799
know tool sets or technical workflow

1514
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,880
processes and so we're here to support

1515
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,280
that and resource it however we can

1516
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,119
but um you know certainly there's you

1517
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:25,200
know maybe a higher rate of change

1518
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,040
you know over the next few years than

1519
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,040
perhaps the past five

1520
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:34,240
so ongoing in process next slide please

1521
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,119
so requirement 61 is developing a

1522
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,440
sustainable funding model

1523
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,880
we feel like there's been a lot of

1524
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,000
progress here but clearly um you know

1525
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,720
this is an area of continued focus so

1526
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,799
first and foremost we were you know

1527
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,160
pleased to have the new funding

1528
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,079
agreement last year with isak with the

1529
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,480
great matching program that lee berkeley

1530
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,799
mentioned a moment ago

1531
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,640
and of course thanks again to lachnik

1532
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,799
for their new contribution we really

1533
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:02,079
really appreciate that and the

1534
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:03,920
leadership they've shown

1535
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,799
um we've revised the sponsorship program

1536
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,640
you know so for example we have

1537
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,559
different types of sponsorships that

1538
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,160
organizations can make some new

1539
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,680
opportunities for that

1540
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,559
we revised the endowment policy

1541
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,640
created a sustainable fee plan for the

1542
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,720
online-only meetings including fee

1543
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,359
waivers we hired obviously that director

1544
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:25,359
of development lee berkeley shaw and

1545
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,839
we've been working with the community to

1546
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,400
define what the hybrid the covet excuse

1547
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,200
me impact hybrid meetings may look like

1548
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,280
including what a sustainable fee plan

1549
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,440
may look like and a newer way to

1550
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,640
contract venues for more flexible

1551
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,280
sizing if you will and so that's still

1552
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,839
in process where as jay mentioned very

1553
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,720
close to um hopefully a first

1554
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,440
announcement for that march meeting

1555
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,720
and it's clear that you know going

1556
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,559
forward there needs to be a little bit

1557
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,880
more flexibility on the sizing

1558
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,839
of

1559
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,520
you know those venues and how those

1560
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,599
contracts work and so you know

1561
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,599
the team's been adapting to that

1562
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,359
and clearly you know we've only just

1563
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,440
kicked off you know that agreement

1564
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,920
framework with isoc and that

1565
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,000
you know uh you know lee berkeley has

1566
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,839
just been hired so

1567
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:14,960
you know we didn't feel like we could

1568
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,280
mark that as complete by any means we

1569
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,799
think that we're making substantial

1570
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,880
progress but we've got more work to do

1571
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,319
and this is where there's a lot of board

1572
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:23,359
focus

1573
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,160
next slide please

1574
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,520
in terms of recommendations for future

1575
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,440
work we included this at the end of the

1576
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,520
retrospective

1577
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,119
first and foremost

1578
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,680
we recommend that a periodic assessment

1579
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,000
be repeated essentially every three

1580
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,440
years just like this

1581
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,799
assessment was

1582
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:45,839
the idea here being to sort of move away

1583
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:48,079
if we draw an analogy to software

1584
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,000
development move away from waterfowl

1585
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,040
development

1586
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,319
to a more agile development model

1587
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,200
and to draw back to ios instead of doing

1588
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,440
a review like every 10 years and then

1589
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,839
having you know a huge amount of change

1590
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:04,000
that can be very disruptive

1591
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,400
and take away a lot of the focus of the

1592
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,040
organization having smaller

1593
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,280
amounts of change and so sort of driving

1594
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,200
that as a periodic assessment every

1595
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,319
three years

1596
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,319
hopefully can be used as a mechanism to

1597
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,400
make more incremental change

1598
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,960
and not push things off you know in

1599
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,559
doing it once a decade in a much more

1600
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,599
disruptive fashion so we recommend

1601
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,119
doing that every three years and that's

1602
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,960
something that the llc will be

1603
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,720
scheduling and driving um two we

1604
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,839
recommended making a couple of modest uh

1605
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:38,079
financial planning adjustments one

1606
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:40,000
during the annual budgeting process just

1607
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,240
updating the target for reserve funds

1608
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,240
and annually reviewing the investment

1609
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,960
policy which we'll be doing again

1610
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,319
you know late this year as i mentioned

1611
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:50,400
with the goldman sachs

1612
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,520
sort of prompted review of that

1613
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,760
and then three

1614
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,880
it seems appropriate that the ietf trust

1615
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,119
should initiate and lead

1616
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,920
a consultation on their legal structure

1617
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,280
just to provide a little bit more

1618
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,720
background on that of course the

1619
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,839
document explains it more but the ietf's

1620
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:13,280
trust structure is very unique

1621
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,119
and the directors

1622
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,839
of the trust end up being essentially

1623
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:19,839
personally liable

1624
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,960
for

1625
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,960
things related to the trust and so you

1626
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,200
can ensure against that and that's what

1627
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,799
traditionally

1628
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:28,799
we've done for the trust in terms of

1629
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,079
providing them funding for those

1630
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,119
policies but it's not possible anymore

1631
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,920
in the way that the insurance for those

1632
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,400
issues work to increase that policy

1633
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,440
coverage

1634
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,599
and so that really is one of those

1635
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,119
issues that's potentially driving a

1636
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,680
change and we really just identify that

1637
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,680
this is a potential issue i think the

1638
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,240
trust totally agrees and they're going

1639
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,400
to go off and work on a consultation

1640
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,200
about what that might look like and you

1641
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,480
know lead that discussion with the

1642
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,839
community

1643
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:00,720
um next slide

1644
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,640
so i think that's all for us and

1645
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,720
next up is the internet architecture

1646
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,118
board thank you

1647
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,319
yes uh so that's me again um

1648
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:16,640
i believe we have a next slide where we

1649
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,520
have photos of everybody right so no not

1650
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,119
everybody has to turn on the camera at

1651
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:23,040
the same time you can see all the faces

1652
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,480
and names here um that's uh the iab

1653
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,000
loves you can stay here if you want you

1654
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,079
don't have to disappear that's right

1655
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:31,520
um

1656
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,839
yeah we have the iab we have lars here

1657
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,079
and we also have colin and john with us

1658
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:38,400
for any questions so now i should look

1659
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,319
at the queue and see if there's anybody

1660
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:44,119
who wants to ask a question

1661
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,520
doesn't look like it

1662
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,960
i'm waiting a few more seconds

1663
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,520
but good news is you also and there we

1664
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:07,480
have somebody great andrew

1665
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,960
i believe you should be able to turn on

1666
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,440
your audio and eventually camera on your

1667
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,160
own

1668
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:19,160
android

1669
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,720
why is that worked

1670
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,720
that does work

1671
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,640
marvelous

1672
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,079
i've got a question

1673
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:31,520
about rfc 8890

1674
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,700
which the iab pub

1675
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:43,119
[Music]

1676
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:45,359
some of the recommendations

1677
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:46,480
or

1678
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,720
practice that was described in that

1679
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,200
rfc89

1680
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,960
and how might get

1681
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,359
the voice of in youth

1682
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,120
um more correctly

1683
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,319
[Music]

1684
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:00,839
into the activities of the

1685
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:03,359
idea thank you

1686
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:05,119
okay um thanks for your question you

1687
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,400
were breaking up a little bit but i

1688
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,160
think you are talking about rc that um

1689
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,119
uh

1690
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,280
says that the user intent should be

1691
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,200
considered when designing protocols and

1692
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,039
the question was if you

1693
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:18,799
if the ib did something to implement

1694
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:19,599
this

1695
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:20,799
um

1696
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:23,760
i'm inviting other ib members to add a

1697
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,200
an opinion here and like even the

1698
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,559
authors of the draft who are not on the

1699
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,599
ib anymore um but like from my point of

1700
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,839
view this is the advice given by the iab

1701
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,160
for the ietf community i think it did

1702
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,039
trigger

1703
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:37,359
um some discussion in the ietf community

1704
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:39,119
but to actually take action or implement

1705
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:40,799
something and consider this in protocol

1706
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,799
design and that's something that needs

1707
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:45,119
to be done in the iatf community itself

1708
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:47,280
and in the protocol development uh

1709
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,799
process

1710
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:51,920
and i hand over to tommy

1711
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:56,799
all right yeah just to comment a little

1712
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,799
bit more yeah miria is right that this

1713
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,520
is mainly advice to that community

1714
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,960
however in the ways in which the ib does

1715
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,680
get to give input such as when we're

1716
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,960
doing reviews of buffs and charters

1717
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,039
we've noted

1718
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:15,119
specifically that this document is one

1719
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,599
that we want to kind of have

1720
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,920
on hand and that we will look at and

1721
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,520
review during these times to make sure

1722
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,200
that it's something that's in our mind

1723
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,799
and that if we see something that we can

1724
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:27,359
comment about we will so that's what

1725
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,680
we're doing

1726
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:33,760
conan go ahead

1727
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,240
yeah i'd also like to

1728
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,039
um

1729
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,799
note that the iab workshop for

1730
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:41,599
organizing in november december um

1731
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,599
looking at analyzing the itf data what

1732
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,760
will hopefully give us some idea to what

1733
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,280
extent the

1734
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,640
you know the people developing the

1735
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,400
standards are representative of the

1736
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,590
broader community

1737
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:52,960
[Music]

1738
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,559
uh so so we can at least understand uh

1739
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,319
whether we are at all representative of

1740
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,720
the end users

1741
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,200
good point

1742
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,440
so um let's move on with the queue we

1743
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,400
have aaron in the queue

1744
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:16,640
i see only one buff on the agenda and

1745
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,200
maybe a half dozen side meetings

1746
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,599
i'm wondering is the ib concerned about

1747
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,760
the arrival of new work to the ietf and

1748
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,640
are you

1749
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,799
do you have any thoughts on

1750
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:27,680
um

1751
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,079
you know how to keep the

1752
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:31,359
intake

1753
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:32,559
uh

1754
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:35,200
moving along

1755
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,119
so i see less already there because i

1756
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:39,039
think um maybe concerned is also not the

1757
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,200
right word but the ihg is talking a lot

1758
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,559
about this

1759
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:44,000
so nice

1760
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,400
yeah thanks so

1761
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,319
this is of concern right and and it was

1762
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,400
a joint topic um we had a recently had a

1763
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,799
little workshop with the iab and the llc

1764
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:54,640
board where this was what one of the

1765
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,839
sessions right

1766
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:56,880
um

1767
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,760
we we are monitoring sort of

1768
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,359
the sort of activity of the itf and

1769
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:06,000
um we reported on it i think at the last

1770
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,559
meeting a little bit more detail um

1771
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:10,720
we we do see that sort of currently

1772
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,640
chartered work is sort of progressing

1773
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,640
okay i want to say there is a like i

1774
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,640
think i remember like a 10

1775
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,640
reduction if you look at emails being

1776
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,160
sent for example

1777
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,760
but it's it's not sort of what i would

1778
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,000
call dramatic um but we do see a

1779
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,400
distinct drop in the submission of zero

1780
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,400
zero drafts and i think that translates

1781
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,559
into uh you know a reduction in in buff

1782
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:33,760
proposals

1783
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,520
um i think everybody is sort of finding

1784
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,520
it difficult to socialize a topic

1785
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,280
especially something that's maybe a bit

1786
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,839
controversial or you know requires some

1787
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:43,599
some more shaping

1788
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:46,319
in this virtual format and we know also

1789
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,000
by anecdotally from a few people that

1790
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,680
basically are waiting with their

1791
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,599
proposals until they get to be back in

1792
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:53,359
person and can present to a room rather

1793
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:54,640
than online

1794
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,240
um

1795
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,160
so yes we are we are sort of

1796
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,319
hoping that we can go back to at least a

1797
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:01,920
hybrid format and we're going to hope

1798
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,760
that that'll sort of maybe revitalize

1799
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,599
the intake of new work

1800
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,440
um but yeah i think the isgn leadership

1801
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,119
overall will sort of

1802
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:12,240
uh see that concern that you raised down

1803
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,240
is there any way that you can add some

1804
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,880
transparency to

1805
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:17,599
so

1806
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:18,880
your observation that you think that

1807
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,480
there are there are topics that might be

1808
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,920
considered too controversial to

1809
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,359
socialize

1810
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:24,240
now

1811
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,559
was something that i hadn't heard

1812
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:29,039
and i'm wondering is there a way to sort

1813
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,640
of share some visibility if those things

1814
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,880
are out there um

1815
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,319
you know

1816
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:35,440
i mean

1817
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,160
maybe that's not an accurate assessment

1818
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,640
um maybe it is but still i i think that

1819
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,240
from a from an organizational point of

1820
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,680
view it would be reassuring to know

1821
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,039
there this is

1822
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:48,640
that this is a uh uh a temporary you

1823
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,079
know uh uh pandemic related uh change as

1824
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:55,599
opposed to um you know that

1825
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:57,520
you know the itf's utility may be

1826
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,119
diminishing

1827
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:02,400
so so uh i agree all signs that we see

1828
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,359
point to this being solely based on on

1829
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:06,079
the

1830
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:09,119
pandemic and not being able to meet and

1831
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,799
so one thing that i um i'm actually

1832
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:12,559
happy about is hot rfc so thank you

1833
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:14,240
again for that uh because i think that

1834
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,640
is actually a pretty useful um vessel in

1835
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,560
which people can bring sort of at least

1836
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,399
the nugget of an idea for new work and

1837
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:22,640
expose it and get some private feedback

1838
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,238
and maybe that private feedback can be

1839
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:25,920
you know you should really bring this as

1840
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:26,799
a buff

1841
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:28,479
um right which we we haven't had that

1842
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,000
for a while and so i think people might

1843
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,920
might have been hesitant to to jump

1844
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,839
straight to the buff stage which often

1845
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:35,679
times is a little bit difficult

1846
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,000
we also i mean we have site meetings

1847
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,560
also um in this virtual format but i

1848
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,560
think i don't have numbers but it feels

1849
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,560
like there's fewer of those as well

1850
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,799
because maybe also the site meeting uh

1851
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:48,719
crowd doesn't get what they want out of

1852
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:50,880
the other virtual meetings which i can

1853
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,120
sort of understand

1854
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,120
um but i i sort of

1855
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,560
i wish i had a better answer than sort

1856
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,000
of hoping to be back in person but i

1857
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,359
think this is really sort of especially

1858
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,198
sort of new work seems to be something

1859
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:02,719
where people really want to sit together

1860
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:05,359
and chat and brainstorm

1861
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:07,920
which doesn't lend itself well to you

1862
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,679
so i i don't want to believe in the

1863
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,679
quote but let me just make i i feel like

1864
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:14,158
we're uh we're completing two slightly

1865
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:19,198
different topics one is um sort of um

1866
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:21,120
i'm suggesting that when you say

1867
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,799
something like uh all signs are pointing

1868
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:24,560
to the fact that this is temporary i'm

1869
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,799
suggesting that it would be helpful if

1870
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:28,640
those signs could be collected together

1871
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,080
and shared with the community so that we

1872
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,319
can all develop that assessment that

1873
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:34,399
what the actual signs are are you know

1874
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,560
that then those the specifics i think

1875
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,399
are you know they are what they are but

1876
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,399
i'm just saying that uh you know you or

1877
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,799
maybe the isg are in a position where

1878
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:44,880
you're seeing sort of more potential

1879
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,238
stuff than the rest of the community and

1880
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:47,359
i think if there's a way that you could

1881
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:48,560
share that

1882
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,439
um that that would be helpful

1883
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:52,319
so

1884
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,719
maybe let me say one thing i think

1885
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:56,320
and this is a topic we've been

1886
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,920
discussing very often before and during

1887
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,280
the pandemic i think we do have

1888
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,920
generally a problem to on board new work

1889
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,239
in a good way to find the right contact

1890
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:05,600
person and to bring people to the right

1891
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,679
stage right so it's not like i think the

1892
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:09,920
ihg is actually exposed to much more of

1893
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,920
this these ideas on new work what we're

1894
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,080
also seeing is that and we're all seeing

1895
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,600
that that there are components of an

1896
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,040
in-person meeting that we can't um

1897
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,960
replicate in a virtual environment and

1898
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,880
these are simply missing and a lot of

1899
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,040
this was was where you actually talk to

1900
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,880
people about new work and so on and we

1901
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,400
can't replicate this and we don't just

1902
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,520
don't have it

1903
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,199
right and

1904
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:30,400
i think what the signs that we are

1905
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,920
looking at is just the numbers that

1906
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,199
everybody can look up from the data

1907
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:36,000
tracker or the email is like we see less

1908
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,159
emails we see less uh zero zero drafts

1909
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:39,840
and these kind of things so that's that

1910
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,520
very good hints but it's also not a full

1911
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,679
evidence what's happening there

1912
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:49,360
yeah i get it okay thank you

1913
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,880
uh spencer

1914
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,800
sorry i also wanted to go ahead if you

1915
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,080
if you feel like you want an answer from

1916
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,239
the isg maybe bring it up again during

1917
01:10:58,239 --> 01:10:59,360
the the

1918
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,120
later plenary and the isgs on stage

1919
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,040
because this is probably more topic well

1920
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,640
as much a topic for the isu than for the

1921
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,880
idea

1922
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,520
i'm definitely agree i think like a lot

1923
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,600
of people contact 80s first so they

1924
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,760
might be exposed differently than and

1925
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,520
the ib is just trying to help later and

1926
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,040
where we're trying to improve that

1927
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,800
process so now we go to spencer

1928
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,080
yeah

1929
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,840
thank you uh i

1930
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,520
i may be talking to the

1931
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:31,679
okay so two two questions um

1932
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:33,760
the

1933
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,440
the comment about uh work being

1934
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,000
considered to be controversial uh do you

1935
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
have were you actually saying that that

1936
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,199
was the

1937
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:43,280
people proposing the work were concerned

1938
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,199
that it was too controversial or someone

1939
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:46,560
else was concerned that was too

1940
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,120
controversial i didn't understand the

1941
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:52,000
response to aaron

1942
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,159
yeah sorry maybe i sort of spoke a

1943
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:55,920
little bit sloppily here uh

1944
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,199
controversial might be the wrong word

1945
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:58,640
but what i've heard from several people

1946
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,400
is that they feel that they're

1947
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,719
they need to have a discussion at a

1948
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:04,400
depth and at a level that they don't

1949
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:09,159
feel they can have in a virtual form

1950
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,640
maybe complex would be a better word

1951
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:15,520
than controversial oh okay

1952
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:16,400
yeah

1953
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,360
uh that's helpful and i'll uh

1954
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,520
i'll follow up during the

1955
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,320
uh open mic so uh

1956
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,239
with anything with any other clever

1957
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:30,080
thoughts that i had thank you thank you

1958
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,960
okay thanks spencer

1959
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:33,840
um

1960
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:37,840
then we're moving on to sanji

1961
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,280
had a quick question i got quite

1962
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,360
confused with the work on the shmu group

1963
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,040
and the hybrid

1964
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,520
and all so it's vancouver planned to be

1965
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,000
hybrid as of now i mean i realize things

1966
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,480
could change

1967
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,320
since you're mentioning vancouver i

1968
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,400
assume there will be some in-person

1969
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,640
meetings there

1970
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,560
i think you have to join the queue at

1971
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,000
the next open mic again that's the

1972
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,760
question for the lsc

1973
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,920
sorry but you can you can probably take

1974
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,040
this question or we can take this

1975
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,320
question at the very beginning of their

1976
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:11,120
open mic session

1977
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,159
um yar you're in the queue but you're on

1978
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:15,920
the iab so i'm not sure if you want to

1979
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,719
ask a question or yeah

1980
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:19,760
thanks

1981
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,679
yeah i wanted to return to the previous

1982
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:23,679
discussion just a little bit and so the

1983
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:25,600
initial question was are we concerned

1984
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,440
about the bots and i think

1985
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,600
we are but i think there are or at least

1986
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,080
in my opinion there are two factors here

1987
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,640
one is the pandemic which is

1988
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,560
sort of easy to understand but i think

1989
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,960
there's a longer term issue that it's

1990
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,360
not easy to bring new work to the ietf

1991
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:44,480
and we've been discussing this of course

1992
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,960
many times but we make it relatively

1993
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,280
hard and and some of the things that are

1994
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,679
making it easier is what rfc laws

1995
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:53,120
already

1996
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,920
mentioned that uh but also um that the

1997
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,880
hackathon like if you compare the

1998
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,960
experience of bringing a new thing to

1999
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,719
the hackathon versus bringing a new

2000
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:05,280
thing to ietf it's quite different like

2001
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,520
go to the hackathon yeah you're welcome

2002
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,199
and you know have your team have your

2003
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:10,320
table

2004
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,239
and and you just

2005
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:15,120
move forward um it's much harder in the

2006
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,199
itf side and of course i understand some

2007
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:20,080
of the reasons why i understand that

2008
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,400
many proposals are also all over the

2009
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,560
place and not very easy to add up to any

2010
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,719
standards organization

2011
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,640
but um i i think we should at least

2012
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,719
recognize that this is an issue it's

2013
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:32,480
it's difficult and right you have to do

2014
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,199
these new things

2015
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,560
yeah just

2016
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,640
want to add you say we're making it hard

2017
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,920
i don't think we're making it hard on

2018
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,679
purpose it is hard to bring your work

2019
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:43,280
you have to understand a lot about the

2020
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,280
itf and we're not doing enough to

2021
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,040
helping people with that and that's

2022
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,840
definitely a job for the iab

2023
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,159
what we what we do just at the iab but

2024
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,159
it's also not easy to find the right

2025
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:56,400
ways for that

2026
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,719
so like if people have more input please

2027
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:00,400
let us know and start a discussion with

2028
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,879
the iab

2029
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,000
okay um the queue is empty now and as we

2030
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
already had the first question for the

2031
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,840
lsc i just hand it over to jason

2032
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,400
thanks and

2033
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,239
jay maybe do you want to speak initially

2034
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:28,880
to the uh vancouver question

2035
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,360
yep um so

2036
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,440
just double checking when vancouver is

2037
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:38,360
but it's a little while off um

2038
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:42,960
vancouver is 2024. um

2039
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:43,920
so

2040
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,199
uh

2041
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:47,600
yes i imagine that will probably still

2042
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,760
be some form of hybrid meeting but i

2043
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,120
can't really guess any more beyond that

2044
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,080
being almost three years away

2045
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,520
if you have a more specific question

2046
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,280
i'll try and answer it but that's best i

2047
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,320
can do i think at the moment

2048
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,679
my apologies i misremembered

2049
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:10,159
the slide will the next ietf which is

2050
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:13,520
placed to be in a city

2051
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:14,719
is it

2052
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:17,760
will it be in person since the hotel and

2053
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:18,840
all has been

2054
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:22,159
booked so the next um

2055
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:25,120
planned itf meeting itf113

2056
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,679
is um we are looking to

2057
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:29,760
book we're currently in negotiations

2058
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,560
with a venue in europe and hoping to

2059
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,199
book and that's the one that i'm as i

2060
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,480
mentioned earlier

2061
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:40,880
we are um expecting or planning for a

2062
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,199
smaller number of on-site participants

2063
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:45,120
about 650

2064
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,960
um down from what would be otherwise

2065
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,560
about 1100

2066
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,600
and so yes that would inevitably be a

2067
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,040
hybrid meeting

2068
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,679
i think it's fair to guess that the we

2069
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,360
will have hybrid meetings for the next

2070
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,120
couple of years at least

2071
01:16:59,120 --> 01:16:59,920
um

2072
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:03,360
given the uh the ongoing nature of

2073
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:07,960
pandemics and the way that diseases work

2074
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,239
that's you jason

2075
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:21,440
yeah other questions

2076
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,679
uh looks like dominique

2077
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:34,480
yeah hi um i just wanted to follow up on

2078
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,480
the community survey i think that was

2079
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,159
mentioned um

2080
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:41,840
and i note that it's both the llc and um

2081
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,400
esg i think both that are covering it i

2082
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,080
just wanted to see if you had any more

2083
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,159
follow-up on it um in terms of the

2084
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,920
actions from it i know that you have a

2085
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,520
whole year that you're going to review

2086
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,440
it but any any information would be

2087
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,080
great thanks

2088
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,239
want me to pick this up when i chase

2089
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:00,320
them

2090
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,800
yes please i'm gonna quick rejoin i'm

2091
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,040
getting an echo here

2092
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,440
sure um the the

2093
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,760
just the the other week we had a joint

2094
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:14,480
um iesg llc iab workshop um spread over

2095
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,400
four days and one of those sessions

2096
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,280
focused on the community survey and the

2097
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,360
output to the community survey

2098
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,400
and the major issues as

2099
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,480
reported through that survey

2100
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:27,280
um

2101
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,560
so um

2102
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,920
there i

2103
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,679
won't go into the details of what was

2104
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,600
discussed um because that hasn't yet

2105
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,159
been written up and agreed properly yet

2106
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:37,199
um

2107
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:40,400
but it certainly was um

2108
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,840
there was an understanding that some

2109
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,520
things there are important that need to

2110
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,560
be tackled by all of us and um this

2111
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,080
considerable effort was put into

2112
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,080
thinking about how we might tackle those

2113
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,280
so i think that's probably all we can

2114
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,199
say unless lars wants to add anything to

2115
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:55,839
that

2116
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,840
i can assume no then so

2117
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,360
let's go with spencer i think you're

2118
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:20,839
next in the queue

2119
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,760
yeah i uh i just wanted to take a a

2120
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,880
minute to uh thank you all

2121
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,600
on camera and live for the work that you

2122
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,800
all are doing

2123
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,159
uh i've been

2124
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:35,280
following

2125
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,760
at a distance you know the work that you

2126
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,199
all have been doing

2127
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:42,000
in the current environment and uh

2128
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,719
this is this is the uh

2129
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:46,400
i think this is the itf meeting where i

2130
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,800
finally realized there's no possible way

2131
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,880
i could i could even contribute to this

2132
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,560
so

2133
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,080
thank you for the work you're doing i

2134
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,239
know it is not easy and

2135
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:59,440
i know it really matters

2136
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:03,400
thank you

2137
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:14,400
okay i don't see anyone else

2138
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,760
so i think we can move on thank you

2139
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,840
everyone

2140
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,840
thanks and that brings us to the isg

2141
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:29,320
open mic session

2142
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,159
and while we're reading uh if if we get

2143
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:37,600
questions and somebody on your ig wants

2144
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,679
to speak to that question but just uh

2145
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:42,480
start your camera and i will

2146
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,840
see that

2147
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,400
spencer go ahead

2148
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,199
on the iab

2149
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:56,880
open mic

2150
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,719
session about

2151
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:00,560
new work and things like that

2152
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,159
uh i think one of the things that's

2153
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:04,960
important to uh

2154
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:09,440
to to say is that um

2155
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,000
we have to you know

2156
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,199
we have tools now that we that so i'm

2157
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:18,800
not talking i'm not talking to you guys

2158
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,560
i'm talking to you guys and the

2159
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,560
community uh

2160
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,719
we have tools that

2161
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:28,880
uh now that we could use more um

2162
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,960
so the hot rfc thing was kind of shut

2163
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,360
down during the uh

2164
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,440
pandemic and it took us a while to

2165
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:38,239
figure out that uh we could actually do

2166
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:41,679
that uh in a virtual meeting or in a

2167
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:43,600
hybrid meeting

2168
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,000
but that and you know we've had uh the

2169
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,400
publication of uh

2170
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,080
public side meetings

2171
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:50,960
uh

2172
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:54,960
in the wiki for a while as well

2173
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:58,320
one of the things that i note uh is that

2174
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,560
uh

2175
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,719
gather is yeah and i didn't realize this

2176
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:05,440
for a while but gather is up between itf

2177
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,480
meetings

2178
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,239
so you know anything that you could do

2179
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:09,280
and gather

2180
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,440
you know today or in the in the coming

2181
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,760
week you could do in

2182
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,480
february also

2183
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,639
and that that that that does actually

2184
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:19,679
have

2185
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:21,280
the ability to

2186
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,600
uh have audio visual

2187
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,719
conversations and things like that

2188
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:28,719
that i think would would be very helpful

2189
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:30,239
for people you know one of the things

2190
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:32,719
we've done with side meetings so far

2191
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:35,520
which is fine is uh leaving people to

2192
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:38,159
find their own conferencing facilities

2193
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:42,639
but if if gather is uh is capable of uh

2194
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:44,880
supporting you know the small

2195
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,400
the small meetings that we kind of

2196
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,880
visualize assigned meetings that may be

2197
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,440
a that may be a good thing as well you

2198
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,520
know it it's that i think it's important

2199
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,560
for

2200
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,560
everyone especially the community to

2201
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,800
remember that bots have never been a

2202
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,360
required part of this they were just a

2203
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:04,239
convenient way of us of us evaluating

2204
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:07,679
new work proposals when the community

2205
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:09,520
gathered you know with much of the

2206
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:13,280
community gathered uh three times a year

2207
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,679
but there's nothing magic about boss

2208
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:18,560
that the thing is basically to focus on

2209
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,840
quality new work proposals coming in and

2210
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,600
being able to move those forward of the

2211
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,040
itf

2212
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,320
um

2213
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:29,120
you know i'm curious if you all have uh

2214
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:32,159
uh reactions to that but uh

2215
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:34,800
i'll uh

2216
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,840
i'll uh hang up and take my uh

2217
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:41,679
to take my answers on the air

2218
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:48,040
thanks spencer

2219
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,320
i think the idea of having a high

2220
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,920
quality idea

2221
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,480
not going for a formal buff to directly

2222
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,800
kind of chartering is a very viable kind

2223
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,480
of path that is one of the outcomes

2224
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,080
that's sometimes recommended at a sec

2225
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,080
dispatch that the idea seems baked

2226
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,840
enough there's enough kind of discussion

2227
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,520
on it let's let's do a little more

2228
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:08,960
mailing list discussion to get charter

2229
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,840
language firmed up

2230
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,320
yup thanks roman so one thing i want to

2231
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,000
pick up that spencer said is sort of i'd

2232
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:18,880
be

2233
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,960
curious to know if uh one reason why

2234
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,360
people find it difficult to uh progress

2235
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:26,239
work is the lack of sort of tools like

2236
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:29,040
uh gather i think so given that sort of

2237
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,120
hangouts and other sort of free uh

2238
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,520
collaboration systems are available if

2239
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,040
that's the case we can certainly try and

2240
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,600
invest there from the tools side um if

2241
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,600
this is really sort of an issue for many

2242
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,719
people um if so maybe send email to isg

2243
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:46,400
or get into the queue now

2244
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,040
i think i still have spencer in the

2245
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,199
queue uh go to him first and then let's

2246
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:55,599
see wes

2247
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,520
that was me actually leaving the queue

2248
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,520
and then popping back in front of west

2249
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,440
uh my apologies west

2250
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:04,239
um the so i wanted to uh

2251
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:06,800
really uh thank you for the for the uh

2252
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,760
for the comment about uh sec dispatch

2253
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,719
uh

2254
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:13,199
as a reminder to me

2255
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:16,719
almost all the areas have uh

2256
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:19,600
some form of dispatchy

2257
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,880
uh function these days don't they and i

2258
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,440
wonder whether i wonder whether

2259
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,800
uh

2260
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,400
being able to

2261
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,679
do something with those kinds of

2262
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:34,239
groups where they're you know where it's

2263
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:36,639
more formal than

2264
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:38,719
a side meeting together but less formal

2265
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:41,440
than a buff request uh being able to do

2266
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,159
that on an ongoing you know like

2267
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:46,560
once between ietf meetings say as an

2268
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,679
example

2269
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:49,760
uh just so that people aren't waiting

2270
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,280
four months to

2271
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,520
have you know see how things go with the

2272
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,800
ietf

2273
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,080
uh

2274
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,400
the you know the thing that jason that

2275
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,719
uh jason was talking about with the llc

2276
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:01,520
of

2277
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:02,400
you know

2278
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,400
looking at stuff more frequently than we

2279
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,800
have been looking at things i think that

2280
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,080
you know i think that may be a good

2281
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,960
model for the technical work as well

2282
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:14,800
as you know to say uh what

2283
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,719
what are we gonna what are we gonna wish

2284
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:19,679
we had a good proposal you know had

2285
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:22,639
approved a proposal for at the next ietf

2286
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:23,600
meeting

2287
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,600
and i always say you know you guys you

2288
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,080
guys would know better how to do that on

2289
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:31,040
the uh with the current structure and

2290
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,440
uh in the current environment but uh i

2291
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:36,719
did i did want to respond to that

2292
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:39,600
as well i think i think you know

2293
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,800
i think you're digging in the right hole

2294
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,199
thank you

2295
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,560
thanks so i mean i think one of the

2296
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,639
things that things like buffs give us

2297
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:54,880
that dispatch type groups don't

2298
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,520
is it seems as though we get more

2299
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,960
cross-area input from buffs and similar

2300
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,560
and one of the things i'm concerned

2301
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,360
about is that we don't end up in sort of

2302
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,159
silos of people in areas

2303
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:10,480
one way we could try and mitigate that

2304
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,520
is

2305
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,760
try and make it so that people are more

2306
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,840
willing from other areas to show up at

2307
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:18,000
the dispatch meetings

2308
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,440
possibly by scheduling things that

2309
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,880
there's less conflict so that with

2310
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:23,120
dispatches or just trying to serve has

2311
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:27,199
more of a culture of dispatch meetings

2312
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,760
are more open and accessible to people

2313
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,360
from other areas

2314
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:32,880
i'm really concerned we end up with

2315
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,960
silos of

2316
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,440
apps working on apps ops working on ops

2317
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,040
routing only are not routing and we

2318
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,159
don't get the

2319
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:44,120
the white cross area review

2320
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:49,360
yeah um one quick um point to that is we

2321
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:51,600
actually sort of discussed um

2322
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,000
briefly yesterday actually and also a

2323
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,600
few weeks ago the idea of whether we

2324
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,679
should have like a dispatch dispatch or

2325
01:27:57,679 --> 01:27:59,600
or just dispatch meeting where basically

2326
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,560
it's

2327
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,800
something i call rfc but with discussion

2328
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,280
uh and an itfy where you can basically

2329
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,000
have a first stop for new work

2330
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,800
and and where it gets triaged

2331
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,280
um maybe into areas or maybe just in

2332
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,120
some other directions and that by by its

2333
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:17,360
nature would be done because the area so

2334
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:18,880
that that could be sort of a thing to

2335
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,400
try out but i want to go to west has

2336
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,840
been patiently waiting in the queue

2337
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:25,239
let's go ahead

2338
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:29,840
uh so first off apparently warren says

2339
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,280
we should be wearing hats so i thought

2340
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,199
i'd join in but i wanted to follow

2341
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:35,840
spencer's topic a little bit um because

2342
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,560
it's an important one and you know

2343
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,360
it's definitely easier to have new work

2344
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,520
when you can get together and uh do it

2345
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,800
in person

2346
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,040
um but we're not going back to fully

2347
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:49,600
online or fully in person for a while i

2348
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,440
mean if we just heard earlier that you

2349
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,199
know we expect march to be sort of half

2350
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:55,760
attended and so hybrid meetings you know

2351
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,840
may still mean less incoming work unless

2352
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,760
we can you know find other solutions

2353
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,920
that you know allow us to continue

2354
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,000
bringing in new work even when

2355
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,760
some of the potential participants can't

2356
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,280
actually make it to the meeting because

2357
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,520
they're in an area where uh travel may

2358
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,600
be restricted for example

2359
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,840
um so it would really benefit everyone

2360
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,600
to concentrate on reaching out and

2361
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,120
helping you know through some of the

2362
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,360
existing tools i'm very happy that

2363
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,800
spencer you know

2364
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,800
mentioned gather for example as being

2365
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,520
around in between meetings um i will

2366
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,120
admit myself i haven't joined gather as

2367
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,679
much as i as i should and i should i

2368
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:31,120
intend to make a concentrated effort to

2369
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,320
do that but

2370
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:33,920
uh just you know even responding to

2371
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,280
email or

2372
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,719
helping out with the guides program or

2373
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,239
something like that you know would

2374
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:40,400
greatly help bring in new work it feels

2375
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,800
really good when you actually manage to

2376
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,120
you know help somebody take a document

2377
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,280
walk them through the ietf process and

2378
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,520
then later find you know that that new

2379
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,040
member that brought in new work to

2380
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,280
become a active member of the ietf

2381
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,639
community and there's been a couple of

2382
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,560
cases over the past i want to say five

2383
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,000
to ten years where i've helped somebody

2384
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
come in and you know now they're now

2385
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,280
they're actually writing more mail than

2386
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:02,639
i can because i

2387
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:04,480
really am not great at keeping up with

2388
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:07,360
email but um so you know final point is

2389
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,199
really try and make a concentrated

2390
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:11,360
effort to help you know help newcomers

2391
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,840
come in and help them because it will

2392
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,679
just whittle away if

2393
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:17,360
and and wither if

2394
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,719
they don't get help through the the

2395
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:20,639
weird process that's the ietf i'd argue

2396
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,000
every standards organization has the

2397
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,920
same issue not just the atf

2398
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:26,159
thanks

2399
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,239
thanks yeah that was a good point so i

2400
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:29,760
actually got matched up with somebody

2401
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,840
through mentoring that was trying to

2402
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,040
bring new work i think it was to

2403
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:35,440
transport and and that was i think a

2404
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,120
pretty interesting engagement for both

2405
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:38,400
sides in terms of you know you could

2406
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,239
really sort of help somebody explain you

2407
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:41,600
know what should you focus on when you

2408
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,600
first present this what are some of the

2409
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,040
questions you're likely going to get and

2410
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,760
so on and i'm i'm wondering so also

2411
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,679
think about emojiera and the mentoring

2412
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:51,440
effort whether this is something we can

2413
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,960
maybe strengthen right whether we

2414
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,199
actually don't only focus on new

2415
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:57,520
participants but focus on new work that

2416
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,120
might come from existing participants

2417
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,960
but uh that it might be work that they

2418
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,600
don't quite know how to bring

2419
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:04,880
could also be something for further

2420
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,360
discussion

2421
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,400
i see an empty queue at the moment

2422
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,159
does that mean we are

2423
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:13,600
ending

2424
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:17,639
almost on top of the hour

2425
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,760
aaron go ahead

2426
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,480
yeah uh so uh before we break um uh

2427
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,239
the the sort of the general the comment

2428
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:36,480
to everybody capabilities and gather are

2429
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,239
a little bit limited and so i want to

2430
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:40,080
take a minute and just sort of talk

2431
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,400
about the hot rfc structure if that's

2432
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:45,600
okay with you uh okay

2433
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,800
so uh so we have a space and gather um

2434
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:51,120
uh for hot rfc um

2435
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:54,639
the the links on the um on the agenda

2436
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:55,600
page

2437
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:58,719
uh and um notewell is the password to

2438
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:02,000
get in um if you go in there you'll see

2439
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,280
where you enter

2440
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:06,639
and after you decorate your avatar

2441
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:09,120
there's directions uh

2442
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,120
on the floor to take you to the hot rc

2443
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,120
space it's laid out like a poster

2444
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:16,480
session uh and so each talk has a little

2445
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,320
essentially a private room and gather

2446
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:21,199
where uh um folks who are in the room

2447
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:22,000
can

2448
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,760
talk to each other but you don't hear

2449
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:27,040
people in outside the room or and or

2450
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,560
hear the video

2451
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,719
there's a youtube video for each talk

2452
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:33,120
where um you can asynchronously watch

2453
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,120
the talk if you haven't seen it already

2454
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:38,000
and there's a whiteboard for uh you know

2455
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,679
leaving messages to other interested

2456
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:41,280
folks and

2457
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,199
or you know having a real-time

2458
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:45,679
discussion and i've invited each of the

2459
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:48,239
presenters to be present in their

2460
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:49,600
uh their little

2461
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,480
poster room uh for folks who want to

2462
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,520
discuss

2463
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:54,960
their proposal

2464
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:56,880
so um

2465
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,600
we've got an hour nominally starts at

2466
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,600
quarter after the hour and about 12

2467
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,120
minutes

2468
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,239
and

2469
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:06,000
you can wander around and talk to folks

2470
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,760
this this is co-scheduled with the

2471
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,120
reception so you don't have to go there

2472
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,760
you can go to the reception and uh

2473
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:15,520
and talk to anybody you want uh and um

2474
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,040
uh

2475
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:19,120
we do have the space for

2476
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:22,239
the entire day and so if folks want to

2477
01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:24,000
run long for any reason that's totally

2478
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,760
fine you're not going to get kicked out

2479
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:29,360
uh and i will be there you uh if anybody

2480
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:32,159
has any questions on how to interact um

2481
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:33,920
and the secretary is also around and

2482
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,520
they're helping people as well

2483
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,239
so i think that is

2484
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:39,920
everything i wanted to get out there so

2485
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:42,480
hope you all show up and can make it and

2486
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:45,760
um yeah enjoy it and give me feedback if

2487
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,600
things that you liked or didn't like

2488
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,199
so that we can figure out whether this

2489
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:50,400
is something we want to continue next

2490
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,638
time

2491
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,600

thank you all for joining the plenary um

2493
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,880
i know it was early for some of you but

2494
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:02,080
i think we had pretty good attendance um

2495
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:03,679
probably only the same order magnitude

2496
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,360
as the the last few that we've done so

2497
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,480
that that's a good sign for this

2498
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,880
experiment um and i'll see you all um

2499
