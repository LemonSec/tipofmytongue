34
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,640
um um

35
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,159
okay we need to get rid of the echo area

36
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,280
excellent

37
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,959
uh so this is our agenda for today um

38
00:03:58,959 --> 00:03:59,920
we're going to talk about the

39
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,080
architecture document that has been uh

40
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,400
moving around and also the coast wood

41
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,680
document

42
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,120
um

43
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,200
and then talk about way ahead i'm sort

44
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,159
of i was sort of

45
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
has it i was sort of dragging my feet

46
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
because um

47
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,478
adam montville was supposed to talk

48
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,238
about the architecture and then he's had

49
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,079
a last-minute conflict

50
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,400
and then kathleen moriarty said she

51
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,919
would step in

52
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,840
and so we don't have either of them here

53
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,759
at the moment so

54
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,280
do we want to

55
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,160
maybe swap coast wood first

56
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,759
yeah i mean i actually put coast wood

57
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,280
first originally and then i moved sack

58
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,040
and architecture up because kathleen

59
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,520
said she needed to leave early so i was

60
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,160
uh but since i don't see her we will

61
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
swap it back and how coast wood will be

62
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,440
next so

63
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,960
i know there's no slides or anything for

64
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,880
coast wood um i don't know if hank or

65
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,960
david if one of you wants to talk about

66
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,280
the current status of coasted and the

67
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,559
upload updates for that

68
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,080
go ahead hi everybody

69
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,160
so yeah um um first of all uh thank you

70
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,520
roman for uh being patience with us

71
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,759
i think uh your

72
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,240
concerns and issues and contribution

73
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,000
have been addressed

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,800
now we are in the uh

75
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,840
um

76
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,639
phase of uh finalizing some of the less

77
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,280
leftovers of the area and directory

78
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,400
reviews

79
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,360
um

80
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,000
that's on us i i thought we were

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,560
thorough but to be honest it's kind of

82
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,280
hard to keep track of this when uh

83
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,479
when there is no issue tracker

84
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,960
but you have a text

85
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,520
review and so so we at everything there

86
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,840
was an issue and there wasn't the uh the

87
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,960
romans um and thing we we addressed

88
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,080
but uh

89
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,720
it appears and roman again you are the

90
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,680
uh gatekeeper here thank you a lot for

91
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,720
taking

92
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,360
on that responsibility i think we have

93
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,440
like 4.5

94
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,919
um issues left there and dave

95
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,319
might have more input on that

96
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,759
i don't think there's any normative

97
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,479
changes um based on the remaining

98
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,600
um area reviews um yeah that's correct

99
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,840
but there's some some some niches things

100
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,919
so i don't know how uh

101
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,680
how we have to deal with that maybe

102
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,039
maybe you two have an uh

103
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,239
concept for god

104
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,960
hank you're asking me

105
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,840
yeah yeah dave exactly so so so i i also

106
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,319
agree i agree so i don't think there's

107
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,479
any normative problems anymore with the

108
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,199
document so so normatively

109
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,319
this can progress i think there's some

110
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,680
um

111
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,160
polishing items but i i don't think they

112
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,720
are the blocker at all we can we can

113
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,479
resolve these in

114
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,720
an isg review

115
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,440
so i think uh roman has posted in the

116
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,880
chat that as far as he's concerned

117
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,560
there's a number of

118
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,319
some some feedback that needs to be

119
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,520
addressed

120
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,400
um yeah but is that a normative feedback

121
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,599
or is this

122
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,960
um

123
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,360
is this editorial

124
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,039
no there are some

125
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,160
things

126
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,919
yeah some things got pointed out about i

127
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,520
think specifically how the iana

128
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,840
registries got shaped

129
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,360
and we

130
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,080
need to bang that out to resolve that

131
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,039
before we go to itf last call because

132
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,479
how we handle the behavior of the

133
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,160
registries is something the community is

134
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,560
going to want input on okay so we are in

135
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,599
and of course in dialogue with ayanna

136
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,319
apparently so and they they have not

137
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,520
raised that

138
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,039
exact issue so that is a

139
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,280
question of a favorite art

140
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,440
um so yeah

141
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,319
how would you propose to resolve that

142
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,080
like

143
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,240
presenting the question to the to the

144
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,080
list and that other people decide on

145
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,000
this i guess that's that the working

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,120
group should

147
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,400
should be the the arbiter here

148
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,479
right i mean ayanna's gonna take the

149
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,240
action that is recommended in the

150
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,639
document but the reviewers pointed out

151
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,479
some things about how things are

152
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,520
registered in ayanna you know and we

153
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,879
need to resolve that i think here in the

154
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,479
working room

155
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,479
okay so so um so we will take your

156
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,000
recent input

157
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,320
on the ayana

158
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,039
topics and and put them to uh yeah

159
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,519
basically we resolve them like in a two

160
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,519
weeks period on the working group list

161
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,560
and uh

162
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,760
and then then go from there

163
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,040
so did you make it make note of the

164
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,440
email that uh roman has linked in the

165
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,040
chat so that you guys can follow up on

166
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,680
that email yeah i'm aware of roman's

167
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,320
input but i i actually thought it was

168
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,959
more of a style meta and not really a uh

169
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,360
a a working group decision at this point

170
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,519
yeah i think i think the decision was

171
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,440
really about what we name

172
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,480
the registry or what path we um we

173
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
choose for the registry which

174
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,360
is more style than

175
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
exactly so that that's what my

176
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,760
interpretation is also but but if you

177
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,600
think we have to bring this back to the

178
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,399
list

179
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,839
sure

180
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,640
but i also think we could just

181
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,360
provide a preference

182
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,519
well i think the point is is that there

183
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,880
needs to be another update to the

184
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,720
document before roman sends it to ietf

185
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,560
last call so

186
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,800
whether sorry

187
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,040
acoustic did not get that sorry please

188
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,680
please rephrase that

189
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,360
i think the point is that there needs to

190
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,519
be an update done before it moves to the

191
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,120
next step so you guys need to do that

192
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,600
update

193
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,440
yes

194
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,519
that seems to be an honor okay i i'm

195
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,920
with you

196
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,720
okay the other changes

197
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,279
the other discussion was not about the

198
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,959
name of the registry it was actually

199
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,600
which registry it was going in and

200
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
double checking whether it's swit or

201
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,440
coast with

202
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,560
yeah that's double checking

203
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,360
so and and i think and and dave okay but

204
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,760
before i attained any discussion here

205
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,240
dave do you have an um

206
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,000
voice in preference here right now

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,240
because i have one but i want to take

208
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,959
the discussion

209
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:43,240
uh

210
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,880
[Music]

211
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,720
i think the

212
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,240
right now i was just going to look at

213
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,680
the draft um i think right now it's

214
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
with um

215
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,600
and the intent

216
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,320
behind that is the

217
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,560
the registries that deal with um

218
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,920
controlled you know vocabularies for um

219
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,839
for coswood

220
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,880
also are to be used for um

221
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,240
the iso swiftag um

222
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,959
standard as well um

223
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,320
and

224
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,440
and so we named it suid just to be

225
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,680
sort of in the middle um between between

226
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,079
the two um

227
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,079
and

228
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,000
i said that the registries could be used

229
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,839
by both um

230
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,079
and that's also why we reserved space in

231
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,320
the right in the registrations to allow

232
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,040
for both um specification required and

233
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,680
and standards track um submissions so

234
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,560
that you know the that iso could submit

235
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,320
um

236
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,680
um

237
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,040
you know updates as well um

238
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,880
and um

239
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,680
i think that was the the rationale for

240
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,519
why it's named the way that it is

241
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,320
exactly right now

242
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
should we more or less respond to the

243
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,320
area review in that in that vein

244
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,720
so so i think the problem here is that

245
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,440
that there was the notion was

246
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,000
but but we are not sweet

247
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,440
so so so if if we want to have the same

248
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,800
uh let's call it major space at the swin

249
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,000
and and then we're always tied to that

250
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,920
and i think some of the

251
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,800
uh

252
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,200
standard sex now says uh

253
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,519
we might not be tied with that we might

254
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,240
be better so to speak and now there's a

255
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,760
discrepancy between uh tying ourselves

256
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,320
to the the semantic realm of just pure

257
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,279
swin

258
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,279
and the improvements

259
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,040
that coast with

260
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,959
could provide and does provide to some

261
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,480
extent that's not interoperable today

262
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,760
but but maybe in the future and so so so

263
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,920
why tie it to the switch space and not

264
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,880
do with the go switch space i think that

265
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,320
was roman's

266
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,560
question uh but roman please correct me

267
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,119
if i'm wrong

268
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,040
oh you're you're exactly you're exactly

269
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,480
right hank i mean we have talked about

270
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,800
the possibility that coastwood would

271
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,839
track but diverge with optimizations and

272
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,920
improvements that swede would not have

273
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,600
and then if that's the case we're

274
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,200
talking about a different a different

275
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,680
animal so yeah scotland it's well

276
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,920
recognized that coast wood should be

277
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,360
where we hook it

278
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,200
there's two there's two different kinds

279
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,720
of of

280
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
registrations in

281
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,399
in the

282
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,240
what's proposed is this wood registry

283
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,720
there's the registrations that deal with

284
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,160
controlled vocabulary values which

285
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,839
from the beginning we've always wanted

286
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,000
to stay in sync with um you know with

287
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,720
swift tags on um

288
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,480
and um those are the ones that i was

289
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,839
referring to

290
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,720
then there's a tag registry um for for

291
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,360
coswid which would allow us to add new

292
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,320
tags to the standard

293
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,560
over time tags which may either

294
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,240
synchronize or or diverge you know from

295
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,360
the swiftag standard

296
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,399
that registry allows us to you know to

297
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,399
to act in a way that

298
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,240
is is um

299
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,480
is meaningful for coast with

300
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,639
and has no impact on

301
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,839
uh the switz standard so i think if we

302
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,199
approach it in that way we get the best

303
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,839
of both worlds

304
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,399
we can synchronize with squid where

305
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,560
it's meaningful to do so

306
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,279
and um have room to um

307
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,240
you know to continue to enhance um

308
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,399
coast with you know where there's also a

309
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,120
need to do so

310
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,839
does that make sense

311
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,399
yeah i think i think both unfortunately

312
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,040
make really sense so so but

313
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,920
i think the the formal problem here is

314
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,279
that we

315
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,240
cannot give a guarantee that i so will

316
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,639
follow our tracks which which i'm

317
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,560
relatively certain they will

318
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,519
to be honest but on the other hand we

319
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,040
can't we can't

320
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,560
assume that

321
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,360
so so that that's roman's argument so so

322
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,519
so there's a there's a there's a

323
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,160
conundrum here of of that we are pretty

324
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,639
sure an effectively i think we're

325
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,199
actually correct um that iso will follow

326
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,720
our tracks

327
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,759
but also we can't put that into an iatf

328
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,240
text because we we don't have the

329
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,480
authority to do that so right and then

330
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,079
so

331
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,639
is our hands tied um you know from a

332
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,800
coast with perspective you know based on

333
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,040
what iso does um

334
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,360
so i don't see the harm

335
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,000
no there's no harm there's just a uh

336
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,079
that's called a procedural conflict

337
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,480
i would see that i think in reality if

338
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,680
you look at this

339
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,079
realistic there's no problem

340
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,199
but if you look at this procedure wise i

341
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,320
understand romans has a tendency to say

342
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,720
this is tied to iso

343
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,120
and and i think i read uh appropriate

344
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,079
wording on the list that seems awkward

345
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,800
lucy thank you for that um

346
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,399
yeah i can see also that um so

347
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,839
i i wonder what is the harm of of

348
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,000
creating a different

349
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,279
course with lane here i i truly agree

350
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,240
david with your assessment that this

351
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,880
should be the same because that is a

352
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,759
benefit that is a very interesting right

353
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,040
yeah i mean well let's let's think about

354
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,880
what the alternative would be right the

355
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,800
alternative would be

356
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,000
um

357
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
i say would have to work with ayanna in

358
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,120
order to you know develop a squid lane

359
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,079
and

360
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,079
then there would be all of the overhead

361
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,920
of having to synchronize

362
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,199
the coast with and swit lanes um if we

363
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,680
wanted that synchronization we kind of

364
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,280
get that for free um really at no cost

365
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,720
to coast with

366
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,760
um with the the current approach

367
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,199
um so i mean this this decision

368
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,679
point that we're at is either you know

369
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,839
do

370
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,000
we do we effectively commit ourselves to

371
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,079
divergence um

372
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,160
from coast with or

373
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,599
you know a whole ton of

374
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,599
you know overhead and pain

375
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,880
um or

376
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,200
you know do we do we move forward with a

377
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,640
path that will

378
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,000
allow them to be synchronized

379
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,799
yeah or it's meaningful to do so

380
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,120
i i think the right decision is to

381
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,960
move forward in the way that we've

382
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,080
proposed

383
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,039
um and again it has no no downside to

384
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,360
coastwood since

385
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,039
you know since

386
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,960
you know coastwid is establishing this

387
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,039
registry and

388
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,799
and um

389
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,960
and coastwood can continue to evolve

390
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,200
independently if it wants to

391
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,440
yeah i think it might look suspicious at

392
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,919
first but i think the benefits really

393
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,520
really outweigh the uh formal uh um

394
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,080
let's call it uh conundrum that we might

395
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,400
face here

396
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,880
but that's me so so so i think roman

397
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,400
said i think this is a wg decision then

398
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
should we just put this to a list and

399
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,360
call it like i don't know a a a humming

400
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,240
thing

401
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,799
on the list

402
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,200
well i'd like to hear roman's thoughts

403
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,440
yeah

404
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,280
i mean my personal view is

405
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,919
it's it's it's better placed in coast

406
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,720
with because i feel like the earlier

407
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,919
conversation we had when we were

408
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,840
developing this is that we may want to

409
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,120
take a divergent path

410
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,080
but again that's my personal opinion i

411
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,799
can

412
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,240
you know we have laid out an argument

413
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,320
that we could rationalize in one way or

414
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
we can rationalize in another and there

415
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,760
are consequences for going one way or

416
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,600
another it's up to the working group to

417
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,160
decide which way they want to they want

418
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,679
to lean and i think either way we should

419
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,760
document you know the the the

420
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,520
consequence of that or you know the

421
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,320
coordination that that that gives us as

422
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,160
i said personally it makes more sense as

423
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,880
coast with me

424
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,160
okay so i think that's the duty of the

425
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,039
editors to

426
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,320
try

427
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,200
to

428
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,160
weigh the pros and cons of both options

429
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,480
present that to the working group let

430
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,000
that be bashed

431
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,559
and then that is the basis for

432
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,280
consensus building does that sound fair

433
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,559
i

434
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,480
i mean i i

435
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,160
i would just like to see the authors

436
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,720
come up with a strong clear coherent

437
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,160
recommendation

438
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,520
this is what you think yeah my

439
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,200
recognition is

440
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,440
our recommendation is as is in writing

441
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,600
too we should do it as is

442
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,160
in writing to the mailing list

443
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,000
and let's see if anybody is opposed to

444
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,520
it and then

445
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,720
um

446
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,640
if nobody is opposed then roll it into

447
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,400
the document

448
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,480
i don't think we need to have a bashing

449
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,480
of this on the mailing list

450
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,679
okay i i was i'm i was i was fine until

451
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,600
the last part about rolling it into the

452
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,960
document i mean because i think the

453
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,480
document is

454
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,039
is clear that the intent is to provide

455
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,880
this registry

456
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,919
to be used by both efforts

457
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,840
so i i don't know what additional we

458
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,199
would roll into the document

459
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,520
so there might not be any changes to the

460
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,200
document but whatever changes you can

461
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,520
take to the document to address all of

462
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,840
all of roman's comments

463
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,240
uh and resolve this open issue

464
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,320
and then update the document so that we

465
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,000
can move on

466
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,280
okay we can do that okay although i

467
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,520
don't know what the update actually

468
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,799
would

469
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,320
include but yeah let's go back and look

470
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,679
at roman's email make sure you've

471
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,200
addressed all of his things

472
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,200
yeah

473
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,720
okay

474
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,000
anything else on coast wood

475
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,559
otherwise then

476
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,440
what's our deadlines here um

477
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,799
maybe procedurally i want to ask uh

478
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,919
uh do we have hard limits

479
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,080
yes we need to get this done okay is

480
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,320
there any possible way you guys can get

481
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,280
this

482
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,120
sent to the email list by the end of the

483
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,720
week

484
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,280
no um probably not this week have it

485
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,120
ended next week

486
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,240
yes

487
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,360
okay

488
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,919
end of next week

489
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,919
um

490
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,360
okay

491
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,039
so um

492
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,159
with that

493
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,480
uh if there's nothing else on coast with

494
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,000
end of next week's our deadline for the

495
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,720
next update

496
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,280
and kathleen did you want to talk

497
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,520
to adam's document i can do the slides

498
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,158
or you can

499
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,240
if you could that would be much

500
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,400
appreciated thank you

501
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,720
okay

502
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,559
all right so this is on the architecture

503
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,760
draft and the way forward

504
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,000
next slide please

505
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,760
did it do my whole screen or no it

506
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,000
didn't

507
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,960
there okay so these are just a list of

508
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,159
the recently handled issues

509
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,559
i'm not adam so i did not handle them so

510
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,679
i cannot go in depth on these

511
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,280
if there are questions though i can

512
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,039
relay them and he can also watch the

513
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,679
recording so if there's any

514
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,679
any questions otherwise we'll go to the

515
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,880
next slide please

516
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,200
okay so these are some of the open

517
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,919
issues if you have comments

518
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,360
on the security privacy considerations

519
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,000
and defining the method to describe

520
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,240
capabilities please

521
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,760
provide comments

522
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,919
and there's also an open issue to add a

523
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,520
section or a subsection on attestation i

524
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,720
think this would be an important

525
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,400
addition this is something i personally

526
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,240
would you know i could put my hand up to

527
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,440
help on that

528
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,679
and maybe some others interested would

529
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,679
like to help to round that out so we

530
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,600
could think about you know posture

531
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,840
assessment in context of

532
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,520
sacrum type capabilities but also

533
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,080
attestation so that we can simplify and

534
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,320
make it as easy a process as possible

535
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,080
for people who

536
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,960
are trying to assess system security

537
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,960
um

538
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,320
i think hank is in the queue do you have

539
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,720
a question hank

540
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,360
or to volunteer to help as well

541
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,360
just uh highlighting a uh um a universal

542
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,480
um comment on the use of the term

543
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
attestation

544
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,720
um

545
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,039
i don't know how to phrase this so so

546
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,440
there's there's this attestation is a

547
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,840
bad word

548
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,640
somehow because you never know it is it

549
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,320
an action

550
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,120
is it so i think what means here um a

551
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,919
title rats working group and so yeah

552
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,120
exactly

553
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,600
we don't need to pick on this

554
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,120
you know bullet because this is just a

555
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,039
bullet on a slide that says hey we have

556
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,400
to recognize that there's going to be a

557
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,840
relationship there

558
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,240
um so if you'd like to help on text

559
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,200
um

560
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,279
and or to work on reviews i can do the

561
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,039
first draft i'd be happy to do that for

562
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,360
a section on that to tie it together and

563
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,960
then if you could help work on it then

564
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,360
we'll make sure that there are no issues

565
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,559
together

566
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,919
issue 7 is on my list now thank you

567
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,720
thank you appreciate your help

568
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,120
next slide please

569
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,520
unless there's any other questions

570
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,960
okay so

571
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,200
i believe um

572
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,279
he's been doing some work with the open

573
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,440
cyber security alliance

574
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,320
um you know for cis center for internet

575
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,600
security

576
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,279
and also the

577
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,200
uh united states government's doing work

578
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,159
there

579
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,440
um

580
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,679
and so i think this is getting at yeah

581
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,240
so working code for instantiating the

582
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
sacrum architecture so this is useful

583
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,440
work

584
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,279
for that community

585
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,720
and

586
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,440
and it's ongoing until it's done so i

587
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,200
believe adam is seeking help in a few

588
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,919
areas to help get this draft wrapped up

589
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,440
and then if anyone else is also

590
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,120
interested in the open cyber security

591
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,200
alliance work

592
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,120
so um

593
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,799
i'm willing to help on the attestation

594
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,240
piece of the draft is anyone else

595
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,520
willing to help

596
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,240
uh as an editor on the draft perhaps um

597
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,120
and and to help um you know contribute

598
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,520
text or reviews reviews would be quite

599
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,880
helpful

600
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,080
to help get this wrapped up on issues

601
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,960
um

602
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,640
michael you join the queue

603
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,520
hey you guys hear me yes

604
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,960
yes

605
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,000
awesome um thanks kathleen um

606
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,080
and everyone else yeah i just wanted to

607
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,880
note

608
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,360
um you noted usg there

609
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,000
i've been working alongside with adam um

610
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,080
in the pace effort and

611
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,960
we have been as kathleen noted trying to

612
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,760
do

613
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,480
i guess in some essence experimentation

614
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,600
coding on how to instantiate sacrum um

615
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,520
under the open cyber security alliance

616
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,600
and trying to help support um

617
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,039
at the same time to finding out the rest

618
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,960
of the sacrum architecture so

619
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,200
um just wanted to say that the work is

620
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,600
moving along really well um

621
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,520
and hoping to support um in editing or

622
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,320
writing to the draft where i can

623
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,640
oh excellent thank you

624
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,559
great um and i think the working group

625
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,960
would appreciate or does appreciate that

626
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,600
assistance just to get this moving more

627
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,480
in wrapping it up

628
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,799
yes thank you uh hank

629
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,039
yeah so my first question is

630
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,559
uh at which stage do you think this work

631
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,520
is

632
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,320
right now so i i actually uh following

633
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,080
pace pace was uh mentioned a year ago i

634
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,720
think the first time it was highlighted

635
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,679
and

636
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,880
i was carefully uh following that work

637
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,679
and and i have a hard time understanding

638
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,720
where we are right now

639
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,520
so it's like in the middle of it are we

640
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,919
in the in the finding the terminology

641
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,240
place that we'd be building the the

642
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,399
overall concept still in the polishing

643
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,159
phase so so where is this

644
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,200
work

645
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,440
uh currently uh

646
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,159
processing this slide they're working on

647
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,480
uh code that instantiates the sakam

648
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,039
architecture and so terminology things

649
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,399
of that nature

650
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,159
are addressed within this working group

651
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,240
so i really hope because this working

652
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,520
group has been going on forever that

653
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,840
we're pretty far down the

654
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,960
path

655
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,120
yeah so that's that's another problem so

656
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,679
so because i don't know where the state

657
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,640
of the second architecture is i can't

658
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,960
really map

659
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,480
what targets the code is is now

660
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,640
so what what the requirements and code

661
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,960
are based on the architecture so maybe

662
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,480
you could help us there

663
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,080
yeah of course

664
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
yes okay so

665
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,440
uh what's your assessment from reading

666
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,440
the draft and have you provided comments

667
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,799
and have the command comments been

668
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:39,919
addressed

669
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,039
no no i

670
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,960
did not provide any comments my

671
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,320
assessment is that it is an arbitrary

672
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,240
set of uh

673
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,320
let's call it solution building blocks

674
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,840
that are in software but in the end i do

675
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,679
not know what

676
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,440
what the current problem that is

677
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,880
addressed

678
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,880
that's my my my first of all um

679
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,840
question here right now

680
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,000
so i understand the problem of second of

681
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,080
course but i didn't don't see that

682
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,000
problem of second address in the uh oca

683
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,200
uh uh uh code that is on on github at

684
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,279
the moment so so there's a disconnect a

685
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,440
mental disconnect for me okay so that

686
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,919
would be for oca and maybe michael could

687
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,000
answer some questions uh let's keep the

688
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,559
draft separate so that beckham can

689
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,240
eventually okay

690
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,760
okay

691
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,679
yeah and i i'm just jumping in here real

692
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,120
quick

693
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,600
the pace effort as it is under oca is

694
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,440
actually fairly new it hasn't been going

695
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,080
on for a year it's only been a few

696
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,640
months um it's been in relation to

697
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,080
what's been going on in sacrament for a

698
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,520
little bit and there's been discussions

699
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,840
around how to start codifying this but

700
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,840
you know from that aspect it hasn't that

701
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,039
yeah i don't know where the year came

702
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,799
about from um

703
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,960
but yeah because i i didn't mention it

704
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,520
sorry i adam and i did this uh back in

705
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,720
the days

706
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,799
no yeah yeah so i mean that that being

707
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,640
said yeah we are working towards that to

708
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,880
try and help you know define what is

709
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,039
within the sacrum architecture but also

710
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,200
fuel into whatever to what we are

711
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,520
achieving within the pace work of doing

712
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,960
posture attribution collection

713
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,159
evaluation so um it we're moving down

714
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,600
that that path and so hopefully we will

715
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,960
have more results sooner rather than

716
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,640
later we we also need to flush out the

717
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,240
github a little more that github is

718
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,559
still relatively new as well so

719
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,880
yeah so so it's hard for me to to to

720
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,720
connect the dots so that's what i'm

721
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,159
saying here so so when you're when

722
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,640
you're highlighting uh this is this is

723
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,360
uh addressing a second to some extent

724
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,640
i i can't really bridge that gap today

725
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,480
but but i'm i'm sure there might be

726
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,720
something there in the future and i'm

727
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,279
happy to uh provide comments as soon as

728
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,760
that happens

729
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,919
happy to talk with you offline hank and

730
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,440
we can you know flush that a little more

731
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,519
just to help in understanding that that

732
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,399
connection so also thank you also i

733
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,559
always appreciate it thank you okay

734
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,279
great so we have volunteers to help in a

735
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,320
few areas from both michael and

736
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,039
hank is anyone else willing to review

737
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,960
this document so that we can help

738
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,039
progress it and wrap it up

739
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,480
or even provide

740
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,960
text where there are sections that

741
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,240
are the remaining open issues

742
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,440
we get some volunteers please

743
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:34,159
[Music]

744
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,640
anyone

745
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,600
all right so i guess uh to the list i i

746
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,000
do hope that we get some volunteers

747
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,760
appreciate your help in advance so that

748
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,440
we could wrap this up and wrap up the

749
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,519
working group i think it's this one of

750
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,960
the last

751
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,360
this is one of the last issues right so

752
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,640
getting this wrapped up would be really

753
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,559
great

754
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,760
all right so um

755
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,678
roman is joining queue

756
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,600
proceed kind of karen i think we're

757
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,440
about to talk about the same thing yeah

758
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,039
i think they are so

759
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,480
um

760
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,080
so the

761
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,000
next item on the agenda is the way

762
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
forward for the working group

763
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,679
um

764
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,200
let me switch back to my other slides

765
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,720
well actually it's just a slide that's

766
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,640
blank and says way forward

767
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,840
so um at this stage uh in the uh

768
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,240
at the last meeting of the ietf roman

769
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,720
gave us a um

770
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,600
a

771
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,240
set of objectives and that we needed to

772
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,720
make progress or recharter

773
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,880
to make progress and recharter or we

774
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,679
needed to close

775
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,720
and

776
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,640
at this stage we are

777
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,320
opening the floor to discussions for way

778
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,159
forward

779
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,519
taking my

780
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,279
chair hat off or i guess leaving it on

781
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,240
i'm not sure which is more appropriate

782
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,640
i feel like we are

783
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,480
not making the progress that we need to

784
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,760
make and perhaps it is time to

785
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,840
close this working group

786
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,519
uh chris did you want to say something

787
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,960
i can't hear you chris

788
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,360
they come off a mute now okay how's that

789
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,320
that's good

790
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,880
that's it all right um

791
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,200
i took a look at the pace working group

792
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,760
i've watched some of kind of adam's

793
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,880
updates

794
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,960
um you know one of the comments from

795
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,360
bill at the last

796
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,440
when he presented architecture

797
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,799
that 111 was um

798
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,559
you know looking for their to continue

799
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,880
their monthly update

800
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,519
pace for the uh

801
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,120
for the architecture draft i haven't

802
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,120
seen that um

803
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,159
the last updates i see at the pace

804
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,880
github site are are from

805
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,039
uh dave lemire who's a really nice guy i

806
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,000
like dave but he's never come to itf

807
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,800
the work seems to be mostly happening

808
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,719
outside of ietf so it's unclear to me

809
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,760
how we

810
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,560
have an ietf working group or

811
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,918
something that standardizes it

812
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,320
so at this point we're open so at this

813
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,719
point we're open

814
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,560
up for discussion up for discussion

815
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,960
hi

816
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,000
there's an echo echo

817
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,810
all right let me drop it

818
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:46,849
[Music]

819
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,759
i i'm afraid it might be a chris

820
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,480
got it

821
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,960
sir i don't hear an echo now

822
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,119
all right so you know to to reinforce

823
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,599
what karen and chris said is i i feel

824
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,680
like we have a real energy

825
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,920
issue in the working group

826
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,640
we we have a coast with document that is

827
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,040
our second firm last got a work item and

828
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,400
we're barely able to get updates to meet

829
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,720
you know specific you know ietf kind of

830
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,800
meetings so you know our cadence is

831
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,560
we're best keys getting an update you

832
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,359
know one spin per every time we meet we

833
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,720
just talked about the architecture

834
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,599
document and we're unable to solicit

835
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,280
kind of additional kind of reviewers and

836
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,560
as far as i know we didn't even get an

837
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,119
update for this particular meeting so

838
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,960
all the data to me seems to be pointing

839
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,040
that we've really run out of steam here

840
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,280
uh so if we wanted to proceed forward we

841
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,119
would need a very strong demonstration

842
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,440
of renewed interest and commitment from

843
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,280
frankly new parties

844
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,200
that would re-energize

845
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,680
us to do something

846
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,200
karen's audio

847
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,480
you're right oh i see what you're saying

848
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,839
i was talking and didn't have my audio

849
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,720
so so

850
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,759
i don't know where the echo is

851
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,599
stood in my fingers

852
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,920
okay

853
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,200
echo's gone um

854
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,280
so i think we need to decide

855
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,960
at the working group level what we want

856
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,200
to do

857
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,280
and then the

858
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,040
and then we need to depending on that

859
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,640
decision we need to talk about with each

860
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,880
of the two remaining documents what we

861
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,760
want to do with those

862
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,200
i

863
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,040
starting at the working group level the

864
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,720
recommendation is to close the working

865
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,160
group um

866
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,079
and i haven't heard any arguments for

867
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,240
keeping the working group open

868
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,240
um

869
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,760
okay so um

870
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,599
go ahead hank

871
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,520
yeah so the audi uh real um um

872
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,359
requirements have on the working group

873
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,400
is uh

874
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,440
let us finish crossfit

875
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,119
and then that's okay

876
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,920
so if that's fine with with everybody

877
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,720
here in the working group i i think i

878
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,160
can't speak against uh

879
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,440
what but

880
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,839
roman just said that there's uh

881
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,880
i don't know we're losing steam

882
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,119
and that's fine uh

883
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,280
there's content here

884
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,240
um that might be salvaged

885
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,960
to to some other place and pace might be

886
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,640
a place i can't i can't tell talk about

887
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,160
that but uh but i think there has been a

888
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,320
significant evolution

889
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,760
and significant effort put into

890
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,000
understanding how this

891
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,400
distribution of posture information

892
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,680
works

893
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,480
and i know that other sdos are taking up

894
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,839
on that and maybe there is uh there's uh

895
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,040
some uh

896
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,079
way to to not let this go to ways to

897
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,680
speak i mean i mean there's a lot of

898
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,320
lesson learned here and i think that is

899
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,280
not to be underestimated seriously uh on

900
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,760
the other hand uh in this working group

901
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,200
it might not come to any uh fruition now

902
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,320
so so so i don't know where this uh

903
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,160
the fragments of of its remnants will

904
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,359
end up but but i would really like to uh

905
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,359
highlight that we should take care

906
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,520
not to just put them into the draw and

907
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,160
be done with it

908
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,040
right so um

909
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,839
so for for the high level working group

910
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,300
decision of um

911
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,560
[Music]

912
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,560
closing the working group or not i think

913
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,920
probably what we want to do is send a

914
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,520
quick note to the mailing list and give

915
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,200
a week or two to see if anybody has any

916
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,440
strong reasons why and strong

917
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,960
commitments for why the working group

918
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,720
should uh

919
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,280
open i should should remain open

920
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,079
um

921
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,760
and in the event of that

922
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,800
uh

923
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,880
we should proceed with closing the

924
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,079
working group

925
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,520
not talking about the two specific

926
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,480
documents yet go ahead kathleen

927
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,839
just because adam's not here um i would

928
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,079
like him to have a chance to speak up

929
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,880
and and um and michael as well because

930
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,680
their work is being implemented right so

931
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,280
we do actually have an implementation

932
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,520
behind the saccum architecture

933
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,119
um

934
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,560
even if that means they're given some

935
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,960
kind of quick timeline because of the

936
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,200
lack of energy just to get it wrapped up

937
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,680
and so that they're forced to put a fire

938
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,319
under the draft and get it finalized

939
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,319
yeah i think part of and and perhaps

940
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,240
roman can speak here but part of what i

941
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,400
was trying to do is to separate the

942
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,079
working group decision from that draft

943
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,920
because i do think

944
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,599
uh i think a lot of work has gone into

945
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,280
that draft and i do think that there is

946
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,520
it's making progress and so

947
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,760
um there's a couple options for how that

948
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,319
might be handled going forward um so i

949
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,160
that's why i'm separating that from the

950
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,480
closing the working group discussion uh

951
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,480
but romans

952
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,960
yeah it just when a working group closes

953
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,000
and a draft is left behind it just

954
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,880
it's never a good thing

955
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,480
but roman's the a.d

956
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,440
yeah i mean i am really sympathetic to

957
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,040
that predicament but i would like to

958
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,040
just kind of reiterate for everyone this

959
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,280
is not a new conversation we have set

960
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,920
the january timer uh

961
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,400
a couple of ietf meetings ago and

962
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,920
everyone is aware that this is kind of

963
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,359
what we're heading and no one's voiced

964
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,200
anything kind of new

965
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,119
again i'm very sympathetic to the drafts

966
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,480
we have in flight but we need

967
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,960
demonstrated energy to to convince us we

968
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,960
can close it and as far as i can tell

969
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,760
we've seen no bolus of kind of new

970
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,720
energy

971
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,280
uh on kind of either document to get us

972
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,640
to closure given the cadence of

973
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,560
publication i personally think we can

974
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,800
get co-suite across the finish line i

975
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,480
mean frankly those directorate reviews

976
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,400
came in in early august and the fact

977
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
that we're just talking about them three

978
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,319
months later you know is exactly the

979
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,079
problem kind of we have but we are very

980
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,359
far along uh we're through 80 review uh

981
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:40,800
and we're through kind of early director

982
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,319
review so i think we can turn around by

983
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,560
january i honestly have less confidence

984
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,920
in the architecture document we didn't

985
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,240
even get an update for this meeting and

986
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,480
if there is this huge amount of kind of

987
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,079
interest here we're seeing none of that

988
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,319
demonstrated here

989
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,000
reinforced here by the fact that we

990
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
couldn't get any reviewers just even in

991
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,760
this meeting

992
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,520
so i'm just kind of wondering where that

993
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,119
energy to closure is going to come from

994
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,359
um jess

995
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,960
hey yeah i want to um

996
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,040
i think i think roman made my point for

997
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,000
me but i think one of the reasons that

998
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,760
adam and mike

999
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,920
brought some of the architecture work to

1000
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,640
oca was to try to get more engagement

1001
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,240
try to get more energy behind an

1002
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,079
implementation that we couldn't seem to

1003
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,599
muster the energy in ietf and i wonder

1004
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,200
if i i feel that the document and the

1005
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,480
implementation

1006
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,400
might even be stronger if they went hand

1007
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,079
in hand together maybe

1008
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,000
um and i know to karen's point we

1009
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,280
shouldn't be making decisions about this

1010
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,119
but i want to toss this out to the group

1011
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,359
to consider if that work could just move

1012
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,520
to pace so that it doesn't die it

1013
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,440
doesn't go away it just goes to a place

1014
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,560
where maybe there's a little bit more

1015
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,359
energy behind it

1016
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,200
well that was one of the

1017
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,640
things i was thinking was maybe it could

1018
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,119
go to pace and maybe when it's it's a

1019
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,720
lot more mature it could come back and

1020
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,400
and potentially be

1021
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,880
published through the ietf

1022
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,839
with various options so um

1023
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,720
it's a little bit unfortunate that we do

1024
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,800
seem to be picking up steam at this

1025
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,359
stage um

1026
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:22,160
but

1027
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,560
if all of the work and all of the energy

1028
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,400
currently is over there than it seems to

1029
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,560
me then that's maybe where the

1030
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,599
work at least at this stage should be

1031
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,800
that's just in my opinion

1032
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,000
i am here to serve what you all want

1033
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
so

1034
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,119
um

1035
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,440
all right so any other

1036
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,839
um

1037
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,560
any other comments or

1038
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,560
suggestions

1039
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,640
okay so i think the next steps are

1040
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,720
a message to the mailing list about

1041
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,160
the plan to close the working group

1042
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:10,880
the

1043
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,440
uh coastwood authors have their marching

1044
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,920
orders for the end of next week

1045
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,560
on an update

1046
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,079
and

1047
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,680
uh maybe a conversation with adam

1048
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,200
and mike and others that are currently

1049
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,520
working on that about

1050
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,000
transitioning the

1051
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,880
uh

1052
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,720
architecture work at least in the

1053
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,920
interim

1054
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,200
over to pace

1055
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,799
did you hear anything different chris

1056
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,280
what i have in my notes what's what i've

1057
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,920
written down to this point i would say

1058
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,720
okay okay uh uh

1059
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,480
roman roman

1060
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,560
so great i just wanted to i just wanted

1061
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,520
third option option chris

1062
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,240
chris chris

1063
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,000
so everything you sounded it was great i

1064
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,839
maybe i'm not remembering one piece kind

1065
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,720
of correctly was there a discussion

1066
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,160
about down scoping what's currently in

1067
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,079
the architecture document and changing

1068
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,599
how much

1069
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,160
detail it provides and rethinking i

1070
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,760
believe the track

1071
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,520
of how that was published as potentially

1072
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,800
a third a third route

1073
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,040
am i not remembering that right

1074
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,640
well there

1075
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,160
was well there wasn't any discussion

1076
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,720
today i think one of the challenges is

1077
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,160
it would be really helpful to have adam

1078
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,839
as part of that conversation so maybe

1079
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,680
that's something we should take offline

1080
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,599
with him

1081
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,960
yeah that sounds like yeah

1082
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,160
i didn't mean to imply that it was

1083
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,280
during the meeting i thought there was

1084
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,640
an earlier perhaps this was a private

1085
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,960
discussion about uh

1086
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,880
you know i won't say more we'll kind of

1087
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,079
have it on the list but i think it was

1088
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,319
around right now the

1089
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,640
current document is a ps

1090
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,800
and we could potentially make it

1091
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,400
informational to make sure that the

1092
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,319
working group has an artifact it kind of

1093
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:07,760
finishes with and then that would

1094
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,359
dovetail onto what we've been discussing

1095
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,599
here that white pace might pick off pick

1096
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,280
up where where the working group left

1097
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,440
off

1098
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,200
we'll get adam

1099
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,599
yeah that's a i hadn't really

1100
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:20,800
that's an interesting idea i hadn't

1101
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,930
thought about that um

1102
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:23,119
[Music]

1103
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,040
i i don't remember if it was this

1104
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,319
context or another where there was a

1105
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,839
discussion about a.d sponsoring a

1106
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,119
document but

1107
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,040
um

1108
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,400
i might be remembering that in a

1109
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,280
different working group unfortunately

1110
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,359
i'm not remembering that one now

1111
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:38,960
okay so i am remembering a different

1112
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,880
working group so

1113
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,720
two can play at this right

1114
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,319
yeah there's too many conversations

1115
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,800
going on at once so um

1116
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,079
but yeah i think that that would

1117
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,520
actually be a

1118
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,880
a conversation have when you when you

1119
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,200
first said down scoping the document

1120
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,040
i i was trying to

1121
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,720
put time bounds around i mean there have

1122
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,560
been many many conversations about the

1123
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,720
scope of architecture and it's you know

1124
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,160
it's bigger and it's smaller and it's

1125
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,000
bigger and it's just

1126
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,480
yeah yeah i apologize we'll let adam

1127
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,760
we'll let adam speak but the way i

1128
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,200
believe the some of the conversation

1129
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,800
went and this was my my word was

1130
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,119
downscope so there are outstanding kind

1131
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:14,880
of issues that i believe some of the

1132
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,560
implementations have identified and some

1133
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,079
of them are open issues and then you

1134
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,680
know there's always a desire like let's

1135
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,240
close them and by down scope i meant was

1136
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,640
not to address them to just acknowledge

1137
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,240
that these are issues with the

1138
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,760
architecture for someone else to kind of

1139
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,839
fix but they will not be addressed here

1140
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,000
uh to be able to put a pin in it

1141
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,400
okay yeah no i i would uh

1142
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,040
i mean if especially if adam is amenable

1143
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,880
i would be

1144
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,640
it would be nice to be able to wrap this

1145
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,280
up some way because there has been

1146
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,040
an enormous amount of conversation and

1147
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,800
work that's gone into this over the

1148
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,319
years

1149
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,558
so

1150
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,640
so i think the action then is to follow

1151
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,720
up with with adam on what his thoughts

1152
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,959
are on on wrapping this document up

1153
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,160
all right

1154
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,480
thank you roman

1155
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,640
any other uh questions or comments

1156
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,400
i have nothing more i think we have a

1157
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,640
very cogent plan like you said we'll put

1158
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,280
something on the mailing list uh confirm

1159
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,200
that we are going to wrap things up in

1160
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,359
january as we said with the milestone we

1161
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,440
heard from the code squid folks

1162
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,480
from the team saying they're going to

1163
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,400
get something out to us next week and i

1164
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,079
i would hope that we could maybe even

1165
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,400
put something uh on the late december

1166
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,760
telechat

1167
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,760
if we can get through ietf last call and

1168
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,599
then we just discussed you know there's

1169
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:34,880
a little bit more conversation we need

1170
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,280
to have around the architecture document

1171
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,880
but otherwise i mean everything you

1172
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,920
describe is great so i was just

1173
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,400
repeating to make sure i caught it all

1174
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,640
okay

1175
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,800
um

1176
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,079
all right so with that um i'd like to

1177
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:51,680
uh if there's nobody else left in the

1178
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,079
queue i think that draws our

1179
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,200
sacco meeting at ietf 112 to a close

1180
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,040
um

1181
