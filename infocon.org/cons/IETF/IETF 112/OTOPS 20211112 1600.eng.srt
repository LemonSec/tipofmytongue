00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,560
so it's uh at the top of the hour oh

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,480
yeah and meek echo now understands that

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,720
i can talk to it uh

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,840
welcome everybody to the last session uh

7
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,920
unfortunately not in a local physical

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,399
location but uh probably from your home

people to talk about uh the operations

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,640
of iot the internet of things and we

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,359
have

19
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,760
i guess actually again a very full

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,960
agenda today uh we always try to uh

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,119
enable discussion here but uh sometimes

22
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,040
where the schedule is for it is so so

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,960
let us go through the movements here um

24
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,640
this session is being recorded please be

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,720
aware of that you are operating under

26
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,680
the iatf note well um so everything you

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,400
can you say here should be uh okay with

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
your ipr

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,600
interests also be nice to each other

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,360
there is an anti-harassment and code of

31
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,439
conduct policy of course

32
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,240
at the

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,320
bottom of this slide you can see a few

34
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,119
bcps if you're not familiar with these

35
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,640
just just think about if you are

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,040
recorded here this will be captured by

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,840
the internet society and the itf itself

38
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,600
next slide is this here so i don't have

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,119
to say next slide is so great um so um

40
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,960
yeah if you have some problems with this

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,880
uh again uh

42
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,479
there has been recent activities uh um

43
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,880
there is an ombudsman uh that you can

44
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,759
talk to uh uh i don't know if i think we

45
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,759
have a very chill crowd here so that is

46
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,720
probably just uh just fyi but if you

47
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,239
have a problem there's always somebody

48
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,920
to speak to so we are

49
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,200
very welcoming community here and uh uh

50
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,400
can deal with conflicts um then uh if

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,200
your first time here please

52
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,959
mute your mics this is an auto feature

53
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,040
for me echo luckily try to use a

54
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,440
headphone to reduce feedback when you're

55
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,720
talking to the group and if you have

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,319
other issues i think that's the most

57
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,920
interesting thing here at the bottom

58
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,280
there's an issue

59
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
tracker for

60
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,800
the meetings that you can give some

61
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,040
feedback on

62
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,040
so we have again

63
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,920
our twitch lives alexia and me

64
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,720
that's alexi and me we have

65
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,879
not assigned javascribe let me look if

66
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,400
there is somebody on jabba

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,280
yes carson is there

68
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,760
and so

69
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,200
michael if you could have a look at the

70
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,400
chats most java people are now linked

71
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,920
into big echo so if there's something

72
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,239
noteworthy on the chat maybe you might

73
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,480
be able to capture that also

74
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,040
minutes are taken and can be edited and

75
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,440
viewed by everybody live here via the

76
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,000
link other meetings materials apparently

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,840
you want to meet echo because you're

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,040
here

79
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,400
um

80
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,040
we have again full agenda so i'm already

81
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,360
taking up uh three minutes of my five

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,799
minutes and the

83
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,599
first presentation is coming up but i

84
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,159
actually do not know how to pronounce

85
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,440
that name be

86
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,040
chat

87
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,360
maybe you can unmute yourself already

88
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,720
and uh

89
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,760
i can start to share your slides uh soon

90
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,239
but there's also some from iotsf have

91
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,080
nick presenting here so michael is a

92
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,000
misnomer unfortunately he's just the

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,239
orchestrator of this presentation

94
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,799
then later in the time frame we have a

95
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,319
framework for integrated literature and

96
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,040
networks i think that wasn't has been

97
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,720
highlighted already on the list and it

98
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,959
might be a 50-minute talk and then

99
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,000
elliot will come in insecure talk about

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,400
some midlife crisis of course not his

101
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,120
but iot devices have a life cycle and in

102
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,799
the midst of it something might happen

103
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,200
so this will be our topic for today uh

104
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,358
maybe there's some open mic at the end i

105
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,358
think we have a last minute

106
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,600
presenter that might be roy williams i'm

107
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
not sure if he presented some slides but

108
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,639
i think he has some news on how uh

109
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,639
signing in the iot

110
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,320
might take a a strong direction so uh i

111
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,080
will when it comes and

112
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,720
remind him that he might have 15 minutes

113
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,840
and not 20 of these so now let me try to

114
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,758
um share the first presentation

115
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,759
which is authentication that generation

116
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,440
that works correct

117
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,639
yes

118
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,759
and there we go

119
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,639
hello uh good morning folks uh well some

120
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,400
of you good afternoon maybe

121
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,880
or even good night

122
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
yeah i'm going to talk about hardware

123
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,880
based authentication

124
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,639
my co-author is the dirk von hugo

125
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,320
or um

126
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,240
maybe the real pronunciation is dirk

127
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,800
he is currently vacationing in

128
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,560
somewhere in africa

129
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,600
and this uh yours truly has to present

130
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,199
it next slide please

131
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,479
yeah

132
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,720
what is this hardware based

133
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,039
iot authentication

134
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,560
um this is actually somebody we are

135
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,280
stealing from somebody i'm gonna show

136
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,720
the next slide

137
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,440
uh

138
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,160
the main idea comes from him

139
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,840
and um

140
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
so

141
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,560
we

142
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,840
basically the

143
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,759
next generation type of communication

144
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,280
characterized by

145
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,440
uh diverse applications

146
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,880
connecting in a heterogeneous

147
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,720
environment

148
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,360
all sorts of uh

149
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,440
technologies uh are going to be used and

150
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,319
actually currently being used

151
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,160
um for

152
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,120
uh in in such an environment um

153
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,759
especially 6g we're talking about

154
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,080
authentication models based on human

155
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,639
intervention 8.1x and so on

156
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,479
do not fit well

157
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,039
um in in the next generation

158
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,759
communication era so what we need is the

159
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,440
hardware what we called it

160
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
hardware-based authentication quote

161
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,919
unquote it could be maybe there's a

162
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,120
better name

163
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,520
we're going to find out

164
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,319
is

165
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,639
via sensing of

166
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,520
video audio or gestures

167
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,759
as a device is playing a melody or

168
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,240
blinking red and blue

169
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,120
or

170
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,440
or a person just touched

171
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,960
by

172
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,800
seeing it from a camera

173
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,599
so

174
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,080
currently there's a project edited at

175
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,680
11

176
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,639
uh

177
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,000
sensing

178
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
wireless lan sensing project

179
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,880
and we as we are

180
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,919
closely

181
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,919
following that project

182
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,960
and

183
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,560
very actively

184
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,639
being uh pursued

185
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,360
uh basically doing wireless lan uh

186
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,319
signal

187
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,319
to do the sensing

188
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,759
and

189
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,720
so

190
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,360
it could be it could be a good um proper

191
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,160
framework for for us especially in the

192
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,199
wi-fi

193
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,000
wi-fi for wi-fi enabled devices

194
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,280
and we saw some efforts in 3gpp

195
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,160
to trying to do the same thing using 5g

196
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,639
or 6g signal

197
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,840
next slide

198
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,039
yeah this is the um

199
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,759
the reference um we got this idea from

200
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,639
professor henning schulzner maybe some

201
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,560
of you know him the ieee future networks

202
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,520
webinar he gave in february earlier this

203
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,400
year

204
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,440
so he talked about these things and

205
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,160
uh we need them new um

206
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,240
include for including new devices into a

207
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
home personal network

208
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,120
um

209
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,280
for these types of scenarios

210
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,639
should i admit a smart teapot blinking

211
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,440
red and blue

212
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,919
here is a list of device manifests add

213
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,240
them to the network admit the device i

214
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,159
just touched

215
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,839
blinking device

216
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,839
admit the blinking device i'm pointing

217
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,479
the camera at so it's very high level

218
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,000
uh scenarios admit the play the device

219
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,159
playing a melody

220
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,080
okay next

221
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,209
[Music]

222
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,279
now what we need key technologies do we

223
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,120
have them in place

224
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,279
wi-fi sensing is uh is being worked out

225
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,920
and it and we could probably have a 5g

226
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,680
60 sensing also

227
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,680
and these are being worked out and the

228
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,959
other one is

229
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,360
i think we need ai or neural network

230
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,480
models

231
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,440
that

232
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,120
will take this raw sensing data and is

233
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,880
going to generate

234
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,640
higher level

235
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,720
things we are looking

236
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,720
for

237
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,200
so

238
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,440
and there's a lot of work going on here

239
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,560
also

240
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,839
actually in our draft we mentioned

241
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,760
many papers um

242
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,360
uh doing work in in these

243
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,040
also enough uh references about wi-fi

244
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,600
sensing project and all that so i

245
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,519
suggest you look and

246
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,320
lo you check with our draft

247
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,279
and

248
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,600
so of course we need also the you know

249
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,680
proofing

250
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,920
making sense sensing resilient to

251
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,200
proofing and adverse general conditions

252
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,240
um

253
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
present in the presence of noise and

254
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
interference from other technologies

255
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,399
this is um

256
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,360
i guess

257
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,160
a nicer play work and it could also be

258
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,000
um

259
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,839
embellished by ietf work uh

260
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,079
in the future as well next slide

261
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,160
next slide

262
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,440
now

263
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,320
again our our aim is to

264
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,160
introduce this idea

265
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,440
and

266
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,839
actually we didn't know any any similar

267
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,079
work in ietf we recently found out there

268
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,279
is some

269
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,880
uh like e-oob uh

270
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,240
project or

271
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,800
there's a draft in emu it's quite

272
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,880
relevant uh to this project we are

273
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,040
studying that currently and then they

274
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,560
have a paper

275
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,600
and there they have some uh results

276
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,519
about the camera

277
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,399
data processing as well that seems to be

278
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,720
very relevant too so those are the

279
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,120
things we are currently looking into and

280
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,920
if there's others we don't know uh

281
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,360
please let us know

282
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,079
so we have this draft

283
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,079
just introduced the idea and also gives

284
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,839
a lot of

285
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,600
literature survey

286
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,279
um

287
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,480
uh we

288
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,640
we we had a mailing list pid lock

289
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,320
which was

290
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,040
established before we have um

291
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,959
re-uh re-engineered if you might call it

292
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,040
uh to

293
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,680
to this purpose uh to discuss uh

294
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,320
hardware-based authentication so we

295
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,640
invite people who are not on that list

296
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,680
please

297
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,880
join subscribe to the list and

298
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,200
let's have good discussions there and

299
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,519
let's try to see if this work should

300
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,839
advance in ietf

301
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,300
um

302
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,429
[Music]

303
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,480
we're going to decide if really there's

304
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,240
work needed if it is not needed then we

305
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,440
just give up

306
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,399
i i think that there is work needed yeah

307
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,560
okay yeah that

308
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,880
that seems to be it i hope

309
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,120
i didn't take more than five minutes

310
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,760
any questions i'm going to check the

311
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,920
jabber i'm on jabber

312
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,000
afterwards if you had some people had

313
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,560
comments i can try to reply from there

314
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,200
yeah thank you i already see at least

315
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,920
bob commenting on the on the chat and

316
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,760
are there any questions directly

317
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,320
otherwise we can move on to

318
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,600
the next presentation

319
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,560
um

320
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,639
ah now i unchecked okay this one not my

321
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,639
intent but uh next is

322
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,199
swoosh

323
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,639
here we go

324
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,760
kiran are you with us

325
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,680
so i thought my slot was a little later

326
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,600
down the line but it's perfectly fine i

327
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,680
can go now

328
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,440
thank you for accommodating

329
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,120
the flaws

330
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,399
yeah next slide please

331
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,680
um we kick started the discussion about

332
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,800
uh industry iot or industry networks and

333
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,839
their integration with id technologies

334
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,720
uh last time in um itf11 and there were

335
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,000
two major feedbacks that we received um

336
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,079
that we should have a framework to work

337
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:28,880
on

338
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,399
and we should find the right

339
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,160
stakeholders

340
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,000
so instead of continuing with the same

341
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,040
document uh we created a new framework

342
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,279
specific document just to have broader

343
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,639
perspective

344
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,279
and it is at a very high level i just

345
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,839
want to share my mindset or thoughts how

346
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,399
we approach this document and looking

347
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,720
for feedback and then of course some

348
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,760
kind of

349
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,079
engagement with other people in terms of

350
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,880
reviewing collaboration and coordination

351
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,760
next slide please

352
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,959
and the motivation is pretty much the

353
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,199
same that we talked about last time that

354
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,959
to what extent we can use i.t

355
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,040
technologies and integrate it with

356
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,720
industry networks

357
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,240
and uh cloudification virtual plc

358
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,040
integration of different kind of uh

359
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
media technologies whether they are

360
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,720
field buses ethernet or tsn how to

361
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,639
integrate those together

362
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,040
so that's still the main motivation for

363
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,839
this document can we go to next slide

364
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,639
and this is the high level structure of

365
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,079
the framework

366
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,480
we tried to divide the document into

367
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,800
three parts first thing was just to give

368
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,199
it a name that what it is an

369
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,079
integrated industrial industry network

370
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,800
and describe and identify different

371
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,600
components and interfaces that will make

372
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,560
more sense from people who are familiar

373
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,720
from the iedf background

374
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,199
and then we talk about uh about the

375
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,440
infrastructure that since cloudification

376
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,560
is one of our motive motivation how do

377
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,199
we connect multiple sites together or if

378
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,959
you have certain technologies in the

379
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,360
cloud what kind of interfaces are

380
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,519
required or protocols that will come

381
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,680
into picture when you have interactions

382
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,880
between cloud and a factory site

383
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,360
and for that we leveraged the

384
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,959
ldn nomenclature which is defined in rfc

385
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,639
879

386
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,839
and our main focus was just to align

387
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,079
stay aligned with industry control

388
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,320
architecture and that was very difficult

389
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,519
to find

390
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,560
and we already we have also identified

391
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,800
some kind of cooperation how we can work

392
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,600
with some well-known organizations and

393
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
reach out to them for feedback and

394
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,959
comments next slide

395
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,320
and it was very hard to find a good

396
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,720
architecture but in general this purdue

397
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,480
model is

398
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,959
quite prevalent in the industry it talks

399
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,800
about how

400
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,600
industry verticals are divided into five

401
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,560
levels

402
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,639
and where how they do exchange of

403
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,040
information from level three to level

404
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,199
four for example when you're going out

405
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,639
from ot world to id world where you have

406
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,440
gateways and servers something like uh

407
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,240
hmi and mes scud and scada house card

408
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,120
interfaces with the id level protocol so

409
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,839
there is a translation of uh security

410
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,959
zones from l3 to l4 and then when you

411
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,040
actually go up to the enterprise or

412
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,519
business level applications then which

413
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,920
is normally you're in the cloud or the

414
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,000
enterprise security zone

415
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,079
so there are three different security

416
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,880
zones and we wanted to preserve this

417
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,320
model that

418
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,160
when we build the framework we are not

419
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,000
jumping directly from

420
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,399
l5 to l0 we will

421
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,639
come up with a framework that will

422
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,680
follow the strict order that you are

423
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,240
taking care of the security and policies

424
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,559
as you interface between top level to

425
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,160
bottom level

426
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,799
next slide

427
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,839
and we did this by using the ldn model

428
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,039
so um

429
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,119
a simple case will be

430
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,119
on a site one i have level 0 to level 4

431
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,079
uh functions and then it interfaces with

432
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,799
site c which is my enterprise zone

433
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,880
and it has business applications this

434
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,200
will have an interface like

435
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,200
internet and what i'm showing here is um

436
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,559
there are a lot of things happening here

437
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,960
actually so there is what i say bp are

438
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,440
my boundary protocols

439
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,760
if i need to move from one site to the

440
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,120
other what kind of interface i will need

441
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,840
and

442
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,600
we don't talk all that much about

443
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,080
enterprise zone because we already have

444
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,160
id technologies there

445
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,240
but then there is a case of

446
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,360
cloudification let's say i want to host

447
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,360
l1 l2 l3 something like virtualized plc

448
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,280
in an enterprise zone

449
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,080
and your actuators and sensors are still

450
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,840
on the factory side you want to have

451
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,240
some kind of remote control

452
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,640
then hopefully there is some kind of low

453
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,919
latency

454
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,400
infrastructure like that net in place so

455
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,799
how would we interact between that

456
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,960
so this way we are identifying different

457
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,840
scenarios and these interfaces how they

458
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,960
should work in the framework and they

459
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,840
need to be find out further that how you

460
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,799
will exchange the security information

461
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,520
or how you will honor the policies

462
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,360
that you need from

463
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,880
l3 to l4 and l4 to l5

464
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,440
this is we want to develop this further

465
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,400
and

466
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,360
next slide

467
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,520
and this we talked about

468
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,400
last time as well and it when i showed

469
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,480
this picture to some of the people who

470
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,960
are involved in the ot they said it's

471
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,280
extremely simplified

472
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,760
there are even on top of it there's

473
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,840
multiple layers so there is no

474
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,160
easier way to describe the architecture

475
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,960
from some of someone who's looking into

476
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,080
the ot

477
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,840
so i tend to

478
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,160
and so i was leaning on the figure on

479
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,039
the right hand side so let's not try to

480
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,440
get into each and every minute function

481
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,320
this is not going to help us so what we

482
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,240
can do is we can stick to these

483
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,080
interfaces and

484
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,200
um let's not think about an end to end

485
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,799
connections between

486
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,400
l5 and

487
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,600
l0

488
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,200
we can think of our disconnectivity as a

489
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,520
segmented interface

490
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,919
so you will have some communication at

491
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,960
l0 to l3 and then you honor some

492
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,799
policies and then

493
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,520
um so on so you go on and build this uh

494
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,000
segment and if these issues we talked

495
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,720
about when i say inside protocol this is

496
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,360
a terminology from ldn

497
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,000
and um

498
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,080
this refers to our industry zone and we

499
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,400
talked about certain issues that today

500
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,640
everything is encapsulated at the

501
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,080
application level so actual data or what

502
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,000
your sensor how your sensor is

503
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,400
communicated it is at the application

504
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,919
level past tcp or udp so this way your

505
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,720
policies are pretty um

506
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,200
they are much larger because you have to

507
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,120
look deeper into the packet to figure

508
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,679
out what traffic should go where

509
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,760
so this is one of the issues that we

510
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,640
could simplify in this architecture

511
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,440
then i talked a lot about these zones

512
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,840
and firewalls are pretty stateful and

513
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,760
how you configure them

514
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,240
is quite a challenge second thing is

515
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,000
that

516
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,919
most of these zones are somewhat

517
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,480
physically separated and isolated from

518
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,679
each other

519
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,240
if we talk about cloud cloudification

520
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,919
and softwareization

521
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,840
we have to think about the security

522
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,919
model slightly differently

523
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,559
and how we provisions the firewalls and

524
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,480
if the scale goes up

525
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,000
then we cannot have um

526
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,640
firewalls with every single flow of

527
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,640
traffic we need to find a more

528
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,679
aggregated or more sophisticated way of

529
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,159
creating those policies and maybe how

530
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,760
the data flows

531
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,480
on the industry floor and even to the

532
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,679
cloud

533
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,679
next

534
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,400
so um so canonical format for

535
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,280
architecture in id technology is that we

536
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,400
must have

537
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,640
a management plane a control plane and a

538
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,720
data plane so from the management

539
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,120
perspective obviously we should focus on

540
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,760
some of the autonomous things and

541
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,840
most of the things i was

542
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,320
thinking about is the device management

543
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,480
that how will you make sure that

544
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,159
devices are

545
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,240
well known within that management plane

546
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,200
of that industry zone they are onboarded

547
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,640
they are secure and they are trusted

548
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,600
and

549
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,360
how do you distribute policies from

550
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,919
management plane all the way down

551
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,799
um control plane is very somewhat

552
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,200
integrated with the kind of data plane

553
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,000
we

554
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,200
come up with

555
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,000
and i alluded to it last time that

556
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,880
it will be quite beneficial to think of

557
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,919
a data plane which is uh more optimized

558
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,640
for industry networks and

559
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,559
obviously it is not possible to use

560
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,559
something like uh

561
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,600
traditional ip protocols or

562
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,760
encapsulations it is just too intensive

563
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,400
and one of the problem is that

564
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,440
we just don't have actuators and motors

565
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
on the floor every

566
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,760
such device has some kind of sensors

567
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,240
associated with them and those sensors

568
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,559
are emitting data the data is pretty

569
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,280
short and the frequency is high if we

570
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,600
start encapsulating everything

571
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,760
with traditional protocols it is going

572
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
to consume lot of bandwidth which may

573
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,280
not be suitable

574
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,678
next

575
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,080
so if you and now if you go deeper into

576
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,720
this architecture we can split the

577
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,080
framework from three different

578
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,559
perspectives first part is the device

579
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,760
side and um defining the end point

580
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,320
itself will be an interesting work for

581
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,360
example

582
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,039
what is my virtual plc how do we

583
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,679
identify this virtual plc

584
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,919
if it is somewhere in the cloud

585
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,559
how do i access it or

586
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,679
how i'm going to allow that virtual plc

587
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,600
to talk to my sensor

588
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,120
um digital twins um

589
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,080
nmrg folks are already talking about it

590
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,600
so it's not that researchy from idf

591
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,480
perspective

592
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,559
and if we have to

593
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,120
develop an instance for a digital twin

594
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,840
for

595
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,559
a part of the system subsystem on the

596
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,200
factory floor how will we identify that

597
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,520
will that be an end point in itself or

598
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,760
we represent as a network

599
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,320
and then physical plcs are always

600
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,559
attached to the sensor

601
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,400
so i don't

602
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,000
we need to decide that what are my

603
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,559
endpoints is it just a sensor or is my

604
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,320
plc itself is an endpoint or is it a

605
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,760
network node from the system perspective

606
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,960
and then

607
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,440
we talked about the trust of the devices

608
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,240
the address assignment and management

609
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,120
so

610
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,440
trust has another interesting part that

611
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,200
i think from the industry floor

612
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,679
perspective we should be more concerned

613
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,120
about uh

614
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,760
the data that is coming into the device

615
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,159
like i'm sending a command to change the

616
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,520
pressure or

617
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,240
move the motor in a particular direction

618
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,159
it is more important that downstream

619
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,559
command has to be trusted than the

620
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,799
device itself because it's anywhere on

621
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,360
the closed factory floor and the chances

622
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,760
of device being compromised can only

623
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,120
come from

624
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,520
um the command level

625
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,600
next

626
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,440
i'm just highlighting that you have

627
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,000
three minutes left uh so maybe you want

628
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,679
some different to some discussion or

629
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,080
questions please take care of that so

630
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
moving on okay

631
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,120
this way i keep uh the second part was

632
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,200
identifying the network thing

633
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,480
and

634
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,720
i i think one good starting point will

635
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,240
be to look at a shake header but i found

636
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,640
the rule pretty um

637
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
i don't know if we can use the rule id

638
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,120
directly but then on top of that we need

639
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,799
to have some kind of communication

640
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,760
patterns that opc ua uses

641
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,720
and

642
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,279
safety is one of the differentiating

643
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,240
factor between id and ot networks so

644
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
we should think about some of the

645
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,159
solutions from the safety perspective

646
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,120
also next slide

647
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,840
uh we can jump this one next one

648
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,039
and so these are the three critical um

649
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,200
organizations that i thought could be

650
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,840
relevant and we can work with iic we

651
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,679
already had a meeting

652
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,880
ua i'm not sure but

653
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,159
it's

654
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,799
might be relevant and i spoke to a few

655
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,720
people and they say that we should talk

656
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,679
to ieee 6 822 project they are working

657
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,600
on some of the profiles similar to what

658
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,200
we are working on

659
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,520
so this was my last slide thank you

660
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,919
so i'm looking for feedback that

661
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,720
we i'm touching on many different things

662
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,520
is it the right way to go about it or we

663
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,400
are taking up too much or what's the

664
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,520
right landing spot for this kind of work

665
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,000
thank you

666
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,840
so anybody uh who likes to uh contribute

667
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,679
or have questions can of course erase

668
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,320
this on the list i i think the the

669
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,159
digital twin

670
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,520
uh

671
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,600
term can be specialized a little bit but

672
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,679
we don't have a lot of time actually to

673
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,240
be honest to to really dive into this um

674
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,520
and we want to leave the discussion at

675
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,320
the end here so i'm i'm i'm sharing the

676
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,679
next

677
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,679
next and sorry for mixing up the agenda

678
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,559
before uh that was uh apparently my

679
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,799
fault so um

680
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,918
next up should be the

681
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,080
the names are really cool

682
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,559
this one

683
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,279
right there here nereo

684
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,120
nick are you with us

685
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,559
hi can you hear me

686
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,679
yes yeah

687
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,520
perfect great thank you

688
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,520
okay um i'll try and do this in less

689
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,000
than the 15 to give us a little time to

690
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,520
discuss so

691
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,240
what i'm going to present today is work

692
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,640
that's been ongoing within the iot

693
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,240
security foundation

694
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,080
and specifically with under a

695
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,679
collaborative project called many

696
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,120
secured which is looking at iot security

697
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,679
but from the specific perspective of the

698
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,039
gateway

699
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,640
and so within that work sort of like

700
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,159
we've come across a challenge that we've

701
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,080
spent a lot of time focusing on which is

702
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,799
is fundamentally how we how do we do

703
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,080
secure

704
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,960
usable intranet browsing so how do we

705
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,360
browse local web resources

706
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,000
um sort of like from the browser where

707
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,720
obviously an iot device is a is

708
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,640
essentially a special case of a local

709
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,000
web server

710
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,240
um and this work i mean there's 20 or so

711
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,600
people that are sort of like dipping it

712
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,760
out but the the the majority of it has

713
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,240
come from myself uh younger sema from

714
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,360
signify

715
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,520
and christian and michael have been part

716
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,360
of the discussions who both i believe

717
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,720
are on this call

718
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,840
um next slide please

719
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,520
so yeah fundamentally what is the

720
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,840
problem so the problem is well you know

721
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,720
how how within a browser can you connect

722
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,600
securely and in brackets usably to a

723
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,240
local intranet resource next slide

724
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,799
um so uh this is you know you know in

725
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,200
the uk if you get if you go to the uh

726
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,039
the consumer help out how to log into bt

727
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,279
hub manager you're basically sent to you

728
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,399
know 192.168.1.22.254

729
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,960
and it's an unencrypted connection next

730
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,039
slide

731
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,360
pretty similar if it's vodafone

732
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,679
next slide

733
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,840
um and so the first two examples are

734
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,080
examples of connecting to the router but

735
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,480
there is a large majority of iot devices

736
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,120
of which like a webcam is a typical one

737
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,360
which pretty good much give you the same

738
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
instruction

739
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,200
next slide

740
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,799
and the next ones i think i've just

741
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,200
pulled off a comcast example but again

742
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,360
it's a different subnet but every single

743
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,760
one of these um

744
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,159
user documentations is pushing you

745
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,279
towards an unsecured web browser and

746
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,960
insert your password and do the

747
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,399
configuration

748
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,480
next slide

749
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,279
so this is an example which jan has

750
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,640
sort of been a bit more explicit about

751
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,679
this is exactly what the philips hue hub

752
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,840
does in the three contexts whether you

753
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,760
enter sort of like a like an mdns

754
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,240
address that resolves or you would enter

755
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,320
an ipv4 address or you enter an ipv5

756
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,480
ipv6 you essentially got the same

757
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,080
problem the browser is giving a very

758
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,520
strong indication as a user that

759
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,360
something is not right

760
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,919
next slide please

761
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,200
so why is it this way so fundamentally

762
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,279
from what we've seen basically

763
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,919
the the technology gives you an option

764
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,679
can either be secure or usable that you

765
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,120
can't be bugs

766
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,678
next time

767
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,640
so take the example from um the phillips

768
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,399
so this is this is exactly the philips

769
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,039
hue um a hub example so there is a

770
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,520
certificate there but obviously in this

771
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,919
case the certificate is signed by a

772
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,240
route and that route is phillips but you

773
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,760
know what is the problem here the

774
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,600
problem here of course is the route is

775
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,399
not signed by the approved routes um in

776
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,559
most browsers and sort of conferred by

777
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,600
the the ca browser forum

778
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,158
next slide

779
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,480
so um you won't see the animation here

780
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
because it's on a pdf form

781
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,600
and the issue is as a user

782
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,080
your if you do try and put a certificate

783
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,600
there and we cannot we can have a

784
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,960
discussion in a minute if you like about

785
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,360
well how secure is that certificate but

786
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,720
you know if there is a certificate that

787
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,159
it will it will at least allow you to

788
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,840
encrypt but

789
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,240
the user is very very strongly put off

790
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,840
doesn't matter which browser you go in

791
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,159
you get some quite aggressive and not

792
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,880
very usable warnings that this is not a

793
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,679
route you should go down

794
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,880
um and you can click around it you you

795
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,240
about three clicks through the advanced

796
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,600
but but because it's so unusable

797
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,840
most manufacturers are not promoting it

798
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
because it bluntly it just generates

799
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,480
loads of support calls because users are

800
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,679
being sent somewhere and they don't

801
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,279
understand how to deal with it

802
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,480
next slide

803
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,480
um and it's quite interesting to look at

804
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,600
this from a slightly different

805
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,120
perspective so

806
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,000
um

807
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,919
most government um

808
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,120
uh agencies i know the the uk

809
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,880
um iot security recommendations the etsy

810
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,880
iot security recommendations and there's

811
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,880
ones in the us and the ones of singapore

812
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,799
et cetera they all have fundamentally

813
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,159
the same guidance

814
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,279
so

815
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,519
using the etsy one as an example um

816
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,720
provision 5.5 asks you very specifically

817
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,960
you know please communicate securely

818
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,519
next slide

819
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,840
and interestingly um in a completely

820
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,440
different section which is on the

821
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,440
section about don't use

822
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,240
default passwords there's provision

823
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,440
5.3.1 which says

824
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,320
um pl please get the the users to

825
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,440
authenticate the device um using best

826
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,480
practice

827
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,399
now the issue here to be blunt here is

828
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,240
if you're coming in from a browser which

829
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,640
is the norm because it's easy we just

830
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,320
genuinely don't know what best practice

831
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,360
is

832
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,039
or or we haven't managed to work out

833
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,600
next slide

834
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,919
and yeah so yeah saying the same thing

835
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,039
here so you know https is best practice

836
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,320
when trying to create a secure

837
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,159
connection from a browser

838
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,039
um

839
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,519
but how do you do that how do you do

840
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,919
that for a local resource um how do you

841
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,279
get the certificate on there what does

842
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,120
it mean these are the fundamental sort

843
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,799
of problems we're trying to look into

844
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,840
next slide

845
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,919
so

846
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:28,799
just

847
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,399
there is a solution

848
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,360
that does work and that's build an app

849
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,600
and quite a few iot vendors and router

850
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,519
vendors do do this

851
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,600
and this does solve the problem because

852
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,840
within the app you can provision some

853
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,519
routes that allows you to bootstrap a

854
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,840
certificate and the protocol might be

855
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,720
running tls but and and you know the the

856
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,960
rendering ui could be html based or

857
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,559
could be something else so but

858
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,480
fundamentally there is a way of actually

859
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,320
bootstrapping that secure connection by

860
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,440
building an app

861
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,039
but there are a reasonable number of

862
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,120
reasons why that's not a good idea

863
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,678
next slide

864
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,399
and then in the white paper that i'll

865
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,000
talk about in a minute we've listed at

866
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
least eight

867
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,480
um but you know fundamentally it's not

868
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,719
the way i see it cut to the chase you

869
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,199
know i always give the example um i'm a

870
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,760
consumer i buy five light bulbs those

871
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,119
five light bulbs come from five

872
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,199
different manufacturers if i have to

873
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,440
install a different app to sort of like

874
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,760
manage every single one of those devices

875
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,079
then something is fundamentally broken

876
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,239
um that's from a usability perspective

877
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,599
there's also all sorts of security

878
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,839
implications so we don't really feel

879
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,239
this is a viable way of

880
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,079
addressing the problem even though it is

881
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,320
being used in part by some of the iot

882
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,679
and router vendors

883
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,240
next slide

884
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,440
so um so we've been talking about the

885
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,560
problem for a while and we've been

886
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,839
looking at it and seeing what we can do

887
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,599
about it i'm just going to do a brief

888
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,879
summary of sort of more or less where

889
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,159
we've got to

890
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,639
next slide

891
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,359
so we've published a white paper it's

892
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,599
accessible on that uri

893
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,720
it doesn't really talk about the

894
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,800
solution it really is an attempt just to

895
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,119
sort of raise the profile of the problem

896
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,280
and try and get people's understanding

897
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,280
about it because the problem a lot of us

898
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,000
have had in this area is is um and i

899
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,240
think michael would testify to this it

900
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,160
takes quite a long time to convince

901
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,720
someone there's a problem here um and so

902
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,200
this is part of this um initiative just

903
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,640
to sort of like raise a profile and

904
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,880
simplify the communication such that we

905
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,160
can start moving forward towards a

906
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,000
sensible solution

907
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,560
next slide

908
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,599
um and just aside like

909
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,599
uh this is like a surface level of

910
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,960
analysis that exists in some of the

911
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,040
documents but

912
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,359
if you actually look at what is really

913
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,359
happening at the moment there's about

914
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,400
six different classes of certificate

915
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,359
that are

916
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,000
are issued to a a browser which is being

917
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,680
used into a career everything from there

918
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,960
is no certificate there which is

919
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,280
obviously not ideal because there's

920
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,480
there's no encryption there there's no

921
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,440
sense of trust um the reality is a lot

922
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,599
of them i'm not that i've literally got

923
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,200
them in my office at the moment and

924
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,640
they're they're the commercial bits of

925
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,640
kit you know they install non-device

926
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,320
unique certificates there which in

927
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,680
theory does allow you to encrypt um the

928
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,760
um connection if you click through all

929
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,599
those warnings but there's all sorts of

930
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,359
weaknesses there and that obviously you

931
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,960
can speak to certificate and copy the

932
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,240
certificate etc because there's no

933
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,160
underlying route

934
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,920
um and then there's sort of like a

935
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,760
gradation of of of sophistication of the

936
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,400
certificate to uh version six which is

937
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,040
okay this is the classic ca you know

938
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,440
it's a ca browser approved root sign

939
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,359
certificate as you'd find on the normal

940
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,400
internet

941
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,200
um

942
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,800
but you've got to ask yourself

943
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,240
should we really be using that for an

944
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,480
iot device and then we could possibly

945
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,119
also look at non-certificate um

946
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,320
methods of

947
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,240
triggering this

948
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,799
next slide

949
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,880
and so why bother i think we should this

950
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,200
video speaks to itself i mean why

951
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,640
because fundamentally

952
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,440
a

953
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,400
relatively uh incentivized hacker on the

954
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,160
way that motors are currently configured

955
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,240
and iot devices are currently configured

956
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,920
it's pretty easy

957
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,000
um to get at those passwords to then um

958
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,320
attack the router and fundamentally as

959
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,520
it stands at the moment this is the

960
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,680
antithesis of a zero trust architecture

961
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,760
you're basically assuming everything in

962
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,320
the home is trusted or indeed enterprise

963
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,560
using browsers the way they're currently

964
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,240
being used in the market at the moment

965
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,720
next slide

966
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,000
um so one of the solutions um and myself

967
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,839
christian um has done something like the

968
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,160
lion's share of work on this um sort of

969
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,680
i looked at some of the work that plex

970
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,720
has done this already um

971
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,599
which is

972
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,800
basically a method of bootstrapping the

973
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,560
provisioning of a classic certificate

974
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,960
to an individual device

975
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,280
on the next slide

976
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,960
um so christian's done quite a lot of

977
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,640
work on this i mean i put a link in

978
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,240
there to some of his um sort of like

979
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,000
provisioning demos and just some

980
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,240
snippets of the of the sequence flows

981
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,880
that we've tried to distill from that um

982
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,760
i think it's it's promising uh um

983
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,119
christian jobs you've talked to detail a

984
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,880
lot better um but there are some

985
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
implementation issues specifically to do

986
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,320
with um dns bind protection which which

987
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,880
does call into question whether this is

988
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,960
really the ideal solution sort of like

989
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,880
that can be applied at scale but it's

990
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,119
definitely an area to be looked at

991
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,599
next slide

992
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,040
and then just cherry picking a few of

993
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,640
the others that are in the provisional

994
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,480
solution stock at the moment so we could

995
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,079
we could lobby to make some

996
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,839
recommendations to change the browser

997
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,599
warnings to soften them but you've got

998
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,440
to ask yourself the question will does

999
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,119
that really fix the problem or just

1000
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,640
papering over it

1001
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,200
next slide

1002
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,839
and i think possibly more interestingly

1003
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,359
i think we need to do some deep thinking

1004
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:56,160
about

1005
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,680
how what does it mean to have that

1006
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,200
certificate on that device and how does

1007
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,760
it get how does it get there and maybe

1008
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,000
there's a role for the gateway or other

1009
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,800
entity on the internal network um uh an

1010
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,280
application cetera to essentially be the

1011
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,119
um um

1012
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,599
the the roots the root ca that and

1013
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,599
actually be part of the both the issuing

1014
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,800
of the name and the issuing of the

1015
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,160
certificate

1016
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,160
next line

1017
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,000
and i think to some extent there may be

1018
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
some sort of resonance there with sort

1019
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,280
of what some of the work

1020
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,480
michael and others have done on the

1021
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,320
brewski stuff because it definitely

1022
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,560
isn't in a similar sort of field i'm

1023
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,119
looking at a similar approach

1024
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,680
next slide

1025
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,920
so um next steps so where are we um so

1026
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,920
we published problem statements there's

1027
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,079
a load of work in terms of requirements

1028
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,800
and sort of like software solutions that

1029
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,640
we're um uh looking to publish um in the

1030
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,000
next few weeks just needs a little bit

1031
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,320
of polishing and then we're also hoping

1032
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,760
to move this of like the underlying

1033
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,400
working model into into the open and

1034
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,359
running it all off an open github repo

1035
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,560
um

1036
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
on our side we keep needling certainly

1037
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,319
on the uk side some of the government

1038
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,920
agencies to try and get their attention

1039
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,200
on it because we think it's important

1040
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,280
and i think it's the profile needs

1041
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,480
raising to

1042
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,400
create a sense of urgency about creating

1043
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,480
um a solution but then also obviously um

1044
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,480
key to all of this is experimentation

1045
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,599
you know

1046
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,880
there's a lot of work being done on

1047
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,240
actual

1048
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,000
working code trying to come up with an

1049
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,319
ideal solution to this but i mean this

1050
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,480
is i'm really exposing my own prejudices

1051
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,640
here but i strongly suspect if we want

1052
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,880
to solve this problem properly we sort

1053
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,160
of need to start thinking about an

1054
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,040
enhanced browser the current browser

1055
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,640
sort of like um

1056
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,079
method in the way that it's set up with

1057
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,079
the with the with the ca weeks is not

1058
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,640
sufficient to solve this problem we

1059
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,079
might need to think about how we

1060
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,359
actually issue the address of those

1061
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,480
devices

1062
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,640
and as well what that trust model looks

1063
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,440
like because because you know

1064
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,680
a certificate on a specific device

1065
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,560
that's being used to bootstrap for https

1066
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,560
session locally means something quite

1067
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,680
differently

1068
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,880
but and this is one of the reasons for

1069
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,200
bringing this subject to the attention

1070
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,880
of this group we're really looking for

1071
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,720
more ideas and more input to come up

1072
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,640
with a better more elegant solution to

1073
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,960
this issue

1074
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,800
um that's it thank you

1075
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,520
and thank you and i think you uh sparked

1076
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,880
already a

1077
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,440
a intensive discussion on the chat here

1078
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,560
i hope this continues on the list

1079
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,079
um please

1080
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,400
enhance your arguments a little bit with

1081
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,839
some emails

1082
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,680
to to

1083
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,760
reiterate the next steps but i have to

1084
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,280
make sure that eliot now gets his

1085
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,440
discussion time and for that

1086
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,280
i will squeeze

1087
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,240
roy

1088
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,680
into all of this

1089
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,280
and uh

1090
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,280
i have to

1091
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,200
find that slides

1092
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,480
but there's only three slides

1093
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,760
hi

1094
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,599
so thanks hank i assume everybody can

1095
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,839
hear me

1096
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,599
yeah so i got back from vacation so i

1097
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,560
quickly called it together this is a uh

1098
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,800
a hot topic at the moment for

1099
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,720
uh the industry at large uh and it has

1100
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,400
some intersections into this space so i

1101
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,720
thought i'd present a discussion here

1102
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,118
and ask for comments next slide please

1103
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,640
so problem space we're working at a

1104
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,000
an attempt to secure the supply chain

1105
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,560
and the us governments with their

1106
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,440
executive order has is kind of mandating

1107
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,000
uh some changes globally for all

1108
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,839
companies that want to sell to the us

1109
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,280
government and i think other governments

1110
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,200
are going to follow that pretty soon

1111
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,119
so we're looking at a software building

1112
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,640
materials and microsoft has decided that

1113
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,440
our form of this will have signed

1114
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,000
software billables materials

1115
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,480
ubiquitous across the company

1116
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,040
so we're working through that

1117
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,040
as part of this the actual s-bomb

1118
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,760
really just is basically a claim of what

1119
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,560
we

1120
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,839
produced and you kind of need

1121
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,480
attestations and vulnerability databases

1122
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,480
to be all sucked into this which is why

1123
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,319
there's a large discussion on

1124
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,319
infrastructure around this and how soon

1125
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,119
we can bring things up

1126
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,720
some of the attestation

1127
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,560
basically intersects with some of the

1128
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,359
discussion the rats community and uh

1129
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:24,880
some other things that are coming from

1130
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,160
google that we need to cover over

1131
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,319
next slide i really want to focus on

1132
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,880
signing in this discussion specifically

1133
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,599
the landscape of software with materials

1134
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,760
is i put iot devices here but it really

1135
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,400
needs to flow from firmware to services

1136
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,960
to ios to os's to

1137
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,920
large

1138
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,280
applications

1139
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,640
and

1140
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,960
what is required and what

1141
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,079
the form of these things are going to

1142
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,359
look like is still highly in flux

1143
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,200
as part of signing of course we need to

1144
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,920
solve the identity what sort of identity

1145
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,839
technology we're going to use is it

1146
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,040
going to be

1147
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,560
certificate based or is it going to be

1148
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,720
did based and

1149
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,960
and right now it's it's

1150
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,040
once again still in flux so we kind of

1151
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,440
need some technology allows us to

1152
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,599
migrate if we decide over time because

1153
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,680
it's going to change the requirements of

1154
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,480
iot devices and and so forth

1155
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,200
kind of put pressure on our existing uh

1156
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,160
technologies like do we use uh our same

1157
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,160
pk cs7

1158
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,640
mechanisms or cross sign things and and

1159
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,760
generate cryptographic timestamps

1160
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,839
i don't know whether that's a great fit

1161
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,720
in in the space and we we're starting to

1162
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,359
look at other alternatives and

1163
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,440
the lifetime brings up an interesting

1164
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,200
problem space for us some of our

1165
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,839
products last 10 to 15 years

1166
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,000
and a certificate based approach most of

1167
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
the certificates we sign things with

1168
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,040
have a five minute our five year life

1169
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,000
cycle

1170
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,280
so

1171
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,760
depending on the old pkcs

1172
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,440
approach we would potentially have to

1173
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,960
cross sign

1174
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,280
and

1175
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,680
get extensibility for for the lifetime

1176
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,280
so we're looking at different ways to

1177
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,760
solve some of those problems

1178
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,800
um

1179
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,040
then we get into technology we kind of

1180
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,280
figure we have a set of basic languages

1181
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,760
we need to get up and supported

1182
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,359
and right now

1183
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,440
if we move off of our current signing

1184
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,240
mechanisms we're looking at two or three

1185
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,800
different alternatives one is

1186
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,920
cozy

1187
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,960
which is my preference at this point

1188
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,520
the second one is

1189
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,079
jws

1190
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,599
and then the third one is google's

1191
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,040
pushing a dead simple signing

1192
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,800
effort which

1193
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,560
we're not too sure has been completely

1194
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,520
flushed through and we're not uh

1195
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,200
entirely happy with where it sits at

1196
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,400
this point

1197
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,680
um so

1198
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,920
at this point we're

1199
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,440
proceeding with

1200
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,359
an effort to try and bring cozy up to

1201
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,920
try and hit the scale of all the os is

1202
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,599
it necessary and the scenarios that we

1203
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,640
think we have to support

1204
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,400
that was my quick introduction i'm

1205
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,319
willing to have discussions and uh

1206
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:14,720
feedback but

1207
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,160
these will have to move to the list

1208
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,599
because we squeezed to in an elliott

1209
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,079
really deserves this time but uh but i

1210
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,920
think uh yeah i think the choices you

1211
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,000
highlighted uh well that's one that the

1212
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,640
iot um space might be very happy about

1213
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,560
so uh so let's see how this will work

1214
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,720
out please keep us updated i

1215
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,839
i switched to uh to eliot now

1216
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,240
and uh he has an interesting topic and

1217
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,800
thank you roy and hi elliot

1218
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,640
sorry for that yeah actually i wish we

1219
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,000
had more time to talk about roy's uh

1220
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
topic as well it's very interesting

1221
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,319
topic so um

1222
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,119
thanks very much hank uh today um i

1223
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,400
wanted to talk about an iot midlife

1224
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,520
crisis

1225
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,280
so um

1226
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,960
what you're looking at is actually a

1227
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,040
game that you can buy someone when they

1228
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,680
turn uh you know into their midlife it's

1229
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,640
called midlife crisis next slide please

1230
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,920
um

1231
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,200
so we've spent a lot of time in iot as

1232
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,160
we are chatting right now doing so

1233
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,160
on onboarding all the way on the left

1234
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,359
um

1235
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,400
we spent uh some amount of time on

1236
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,280
credential renewal whether it's ace aces

1237
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,559
and even on the slide but you know you

1238
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,559
could imagine some stuff going on in ace

1239
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,400
we certainly have est there are all

1240
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,680
sorts of ways that we talk about

1241
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,559
credential renewal and on the right side

1242
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,480
right you know

1243
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,079
people don't spend any time thinking

1244
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:39,440
about decommissioning even though it's

1245
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,119
turning out to be a big problem when i'm

1246
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,800
not even going to get to that today

1247
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,760
that's end of life crisis right but just

1248
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,920
today it's midlife crisis i'm sort of in

1249
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,520
the middle there to talk about the

1250
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,400
transfer next slide please

1251
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,359
so um you know the big problem here is

1252
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,640
you you somebody's moving let's say or

1253
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,880
the device is being transferred

1254
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,960
my favorite example is the house though

1255
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,520
where you're moving and now you put in

1256
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,720
all of this

1257
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,559
lovely iot

1258
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:09,920
stuff

1259
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,880
and

1260
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,800
the next guy moves in

1261
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,319
um and how does it know uh how does the

1262
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:19,040
next guy even how does how is the xy

1263
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,000
able to associate this stuff with it's

1264
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,319
with his or her network um

1265
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,119
next slide please

1266
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,559
um and by the way if if people are

1267
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,400
moving in right

1268
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,000
you might not have the cooperation of

1269
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,680
the person who moved out

1270
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,760
um here we have a demonstration of that

1271
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,599
where somebody got moved out i don't

1272
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,079
know by jumping out a window

1273
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,680
um so uh now that stuff you know that

1274
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,400
that maybe was put in by the landlord

1275
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,720
for instance uh now needs to be

1276
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,000
transferred uh to the next or or reowned

1277
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,440
or re-accessed uh by the next person

1278
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,480
um

1279
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,000
and we're talking about things like

1280
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,119
heaters

1281
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,720
um

1282
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,559
thermostats

1283
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:07,280
door locks you name it so some of this

1284
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,720
stuff is not you're not going to take it

1285
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,160
with you when you go whether it's

1286
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,400
voluntary or involuntary

1287
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,559
okay next slide please

1288
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,280
and when the next guy comes in

1289
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,200
there you're you're lucky if you have

1290
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,160
the manual you know maybe you're able to

1291
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,920
um you know look the manual up online

1292
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,400
right maybe not um

1293
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,079
but you're certainly not even going to

1294
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,680
hit you know you know when i mention the

1295
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,520
reset button if it says push the reset

1296
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,599
button if the thing is in the ceiling

1297
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:36,880
good luck

1298
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,359
right so finding the reset button maybe

1299
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,319
that's not possible based on where it is

1300
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,800
um so what do you do right

1301
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,680
next slide please

1302
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,839
so there are two challenges the first is

1303
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,520
knowing that these things are in your

1304
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,280
environment already

1305
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,680
um you may not know when you move in a

1306
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,599
perfect example might be a sprinkler

1307
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,599
system right which has a very

1308
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,520
conventional front-end user interface

1309
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,599
but doesn't indicate at all that it has

1310
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,760
an iot interface maybe that iot

1311
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,839
interface is even a 3g interface so it's

1312
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,680
not even interacting with your local

1313
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,720
network

1314
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,319
um the person was defenestrated right

1315
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,240
but comes back right because it didn't

1316
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,920
get survived and decides to play with

1317
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,200
your sprinkler system remotely

1318
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,800
right so these are

1319
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,480
these are actually some serious you know

1320
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,599
issues

1321
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,839
if and and worse if it's your door lock

1322
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,119
right now at least your door lock you

1323
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,640
probably will replace if you don't know

1324
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,599
how to control it if you're smart right

1325
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,200
but if you don't understand the

1326
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,960
interface who knows

1327
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,280
so then you know so so it's a matter of

1328
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,800
discovering what's there

1329
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,079
and figuring out what to do with them

1330
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,240
once you've discovered them right can

1331
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,960
you is a reset button a reasonable thing

1332
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,800
in a consumer space

1333
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,599
maybe sometimes in an enterprise space

1334
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,520
say in rented space

1335
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,440
not at all next slide please

1336
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,359
that's it

1337
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:02,800
so

1338
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,800
one of the things i'm looking for is

1339
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,119
what does good look like

1340
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,839
because i'm not sure that we have a

1341
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,160
shared vision as to what good looks like

1342
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,240
in this space particularly in the home

1343
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,720
than in the enterprise and elsewhere

1344
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,920
so

1345
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,440
hank asked me to make sure this is

1346
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,680
interactive i'm asking you please make

1347
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,839
sure this is interactive and with that

1348
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:27,000
i'll stop

1349
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,880
and you have to unmute your thingy

1350
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,520
manually

1351
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,079
i do have a question have you started

1352
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,280
talking with the smart hub

1353
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,760
like smart things and uh

1354
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,599
and so forth what are their what are

1355
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,000
their thoughts in this area

1356
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,800
um i'm i'm just beginning to talk with

1357
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,200
them so we we i've certainly talked to

1358
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,280
people like phillips before

1359
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,480
we've talked to

1360
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,040
uh siemens before a little bit

1361
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,160
uh in this context and everybody has a

1362
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,000
slightly different version of this some

1363
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,440
people will say for instance in the

1364
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,880
rental market

1365
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,880
maybe you know it's the it's the owner

1366
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,040
who maintains ultimate control and

1367
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,400
manages the shift of of of of who's

1368
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,040
allowed to access what and in the cloud

1369
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,640
right that that

1370
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,400
that adds a whole different dimension to

1371
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,079
this problem right because if that

1372
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,800
access is controlled in the cloud um

1373
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,800
from one transferring from one person to

1374
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,800
another the the cloud registration has

1375
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,280
to occur so everybody's all over the map

1376
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,640
on this from what i can gather

1377
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,839
thanks micah

1378
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,520
hi elliot so um i think thank you for

1379
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,000
actually continuing i think last time's

1380
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,720
conversation about ownership transfer

1381
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,920
and i think that's a really good

1382
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,319
question about a good in my mind one of

1383
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,160
the things that good would be

1384
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,759
would be some kind of a

1385
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,079
protocol that

1386
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:09,839
allows you to collect

1387
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,800
uh the essentially statements of i

1388
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,040
assert control over device into a single

1389
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,119
place so that um

1390
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:18,559
you know that could be handed over by

1391
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:22,240
the lawyer um whether or not the uh

1392
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,200
their

1393
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,280
regardless of how the previous owner was

1394
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,480
removed

1395
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,920
um and that would be essentially a

1396
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,680
condition you know that same way you get

1397
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,839
sales you get keys you get other stuff

1398
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,359
through the lawyer and if they don't

1399
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,280
give it to you then

1400
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,880
there's issues right

1401
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,400
um and i think that would be the

1402
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,920
interesting thing to get that collection

1403
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,119
of statements that allow you to

1404
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,640
essentially these these ownership

1405
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,319
vouchers that allow you to do things

1406
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,240
where's your app

1407
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,400
uh yep thank you so

1408
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,760
very interesting problem i think the

1409
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,280
discovery one is is one of the most

1410
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,200
interesting ones because

1411
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,800
once a device has you know

1412
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,640
been left in the house and the original

1413
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,240
wi-fi router went away and it's no

1414
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,480
longer connected anything there's not

1415
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,319
much you can do there you know again if

1416
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,240
it's a light you know up above me or

1417
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,760
something like that and i'm the new

1418
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,440
owner and i won't know

1419
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,200
sending out a ping saying i'm lost

1420
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,680
please you know reconnect me is is hard

1421
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,680
to do unless you mandate that they also

1422
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,200
go push the

1423
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,280
discovery button otherwise somebody

1424
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,960
outside my house might actually you know

1425
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,720
pick up and be able to control my lights

1426
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,720
because the device was considered itself

1427
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,040
lost and let anybody register it

1428
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,079
so that problem is in particularly a

1429
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,000
hard one to solve and

1430
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,559
good luck

1431
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,480
so that was more like a reinforcement of

1432
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:51,319
the problem statement thank you eric

1433
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:01,200
might be still a mute right okay

1434
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,520
i get some echo when i start talking

1435
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,839
um so yeah this is an important problem

1436
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,680
right and i can try to draw some

1437
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,359
parallels for what's going on in the

1438
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:12,400
physical space

1439
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,319
and if you look at sort of getting the

1440
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,400
keys to the house

1441
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,319
yeah at least you know how many doors

1442
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:21,520
you have that have locks on them um

1443
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,359
and you can assume that the people that

1444
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:24,799
are selling the house are giving you the

1445
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,559
keys there are some things that you

1446
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:28,480
either have to say well i'm gonna re-key

1447
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,599
because i don't know if they had an

1448
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,359
extra copy right

1449
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:32,640
or do you trust them that they actually

1450
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,240
gave you all the all the copies they had

1451
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,119
of the keys to the front door

1452
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:38,960
so um

1453
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,960
if you then take well i have i have

1454
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,680
these things that are stored elsewhere

1455
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,919
well

1456
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:47,599
there might be some parallels in an

1457
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,520
apartment building that the owner of the

1458
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,280
apartment building has a master key

1459
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,280
right so even if somebody leads through

1460
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,640
the window it doesn't return the keys

1461
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,920
whatever

1462
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,680
they can actually take care of it and

1463
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,839
take it over right and you can view that

1464
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:02,960
as okay should i escrow

1465
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,359
the credentials for these devices

1466
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,200
somewhere because it's an apartment

1467
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,400
building

1468
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,799
or should i escrow the method by which i

1469
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:13,599
can reset them

1470
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,119
and and how can i actually make sure

1471
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:16,640
that you have the whole inventory as

1472
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,160
opposed to there's some you know smoke

1473
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,720
detector that can remotely be triggered

1474
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,240
that you didn't actually know about but

1475
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,400
there's clearly some unsolvable problems

1476
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,079
in this space but

1477
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,240
um but i think that sort of trying to

1478
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,440
train with

1479
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,880
what are the use cases because

1480
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,319
normally people don't like escorting

1481
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:37,280
credentials for good reasons but but for

1482
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,680
rentals it might be the only way of

1483
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,760
handling this thing and commercial might

1484
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,880
have similar things that i want to keep

1485
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,799
track of all of my keys somewhere in a

1486
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:49,760
vault for my enterprise in the cloud

1487
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,440
so wouldn't i want to do the same thing

1488
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,359
for the the things that's in my factory

1489
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,359
right keep them in a vault somewhere or

1490
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:57,440
someone else can come and pick them up

1491
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,960
and you only have to grant access to

1492
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,799
that wall but that clearly it's probably

1493
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:02,160
not going to work for a consumer type

1494
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,119
thing

1495
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,119
so interesting problem

1496
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,160
um definitely

1497
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,720
thanks eric so i would love to see some

1498
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,359
of the uh um problem statements

1499
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,079
associated with the uh existing building

1500
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,280
blocks and gaps but i can see uh

1501
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,119
vessels in the line and

1502
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:25,040
and then edit has this camera on so

1503
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,799
where's really quick i think elliott

1504
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,720
also wants to have some

1505
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,160
final remarks

1506
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,680
yeah i just had a crazy bad idea so i

1507
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,160
thought they throw it out there right if

1508
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,520
iot devices actually within a

1509
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,760
uh within an infrastructure we're able

1510
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,280
to at least communicate with each other

1511
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,559
that they know each other and that's all

1512
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,079
they really need to do

1513
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,319
then when new owner comes in they can

1514
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,480
say you know i found the refrigerator i

1515
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,720
know it's an iot device and they can ask

1516
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,480
it sort of what else is around that used

1517
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,839
to be part of the the previously

1518
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:56,400
existing network that's a bad idea and

1519
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,680
maybe a good idea at the same time

1520
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,760
thanks elliot

1521
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,160
okay so um

1522
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,720
i think we all agree this is a this is a

1523
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,319
problem

1524
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:11,920
um

1525
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,079
and i think the way that we normally do

1526
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:15,440
these sorts of things in this

1527
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,480
organization is we document out

1528
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,599
you know

1529
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,079
what we think the world sort of looks

1530
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,520
like sort of the the scenarios of

1531
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,079
life in a life in a consumer space what

1532
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,400
happens when i sell my car

1533
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,799
and to somebody else for instance

1534
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:33,920
um

1535
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,000
you know and there are opportunities

1536
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,920
here like cars are pretty big ticket

1537
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,920
items so so it becomes

1538
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,000
a little bit of a

1539
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,400
you know sometimes big ticket items have

1540
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,240
easier solutions for this

1541
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,079
um whereas you know a thermostat might

1542
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:51,920
might not be as big enough ticket item

1543
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,040
so

1544
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,599
what we can do i think is maybe start to

1545
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,839
document this out

1546
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,440
and and i think it's probably a good use

1547
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,359
of iot ops actually

1548
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:02,880
to do just that

1549
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,520
and to say okay here you know start by

1550
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,240
saying here's here are the scenarios

1551
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,000
here are some of the principles we think

1552
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,200
apply

1553
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,079
in terms of solving this problem like

1554
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,079
uh you know

1555
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:19,119
we don't really like the idea of of

1556
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:20,799
doing um

1557
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:23,280
some sort of key escrow right because

1558
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,559
the

1559
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,240
whoever's escrowing is probably not

1560
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,559
doing it well for instance

1561
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,440
um as when we can document that out

1562
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,520
and then once we have some principles we

1563
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,040
might even start talking about

1564
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,480
mechanisms

1565
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,319
i think it's a little early

1566
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:40,559
for mechanisms i just like to get some

1567
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:43,599
feel for what good looks like so

1568
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:46,000
what i'm looking for i think are a

1569
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,480
couple of co-authors

1570
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,880
um to work on this maybe even a small

1571
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,799
design team of people who would be

1572
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,000
interested

1573
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,160
and then um if we can get that going

1574
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,760
what i propose to do is to come back to

1575
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,200
you in march with

1576
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:03,839
my con my co-conspirators at that point

1577
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,079
to say here's what we think

1578
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:08,240
um here's where we think we are

1579
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,520
probably we'll get to the point where

1580
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,280
we've documented the scenarios maybe

1581
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,119
we've even got a few principles at that

1582
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,760
point and we'll see how far we got

1583
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,760
that's my proposal

1584
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,079
thoughts

1585
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,599
so we're at the top of the hour but

1586
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:26,160
thoughts are always welcome so

1587
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,880
if there are co-conspirators that

1588
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,280
want to speak out right now

1589
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,920
that's a chance but also uh of course

1590
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,520
this is something you can contact elliot

1591
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,160
or the list with

1592
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,079
and

1593
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,799
practically we are at the top of the

1594
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:46,000
hour but i want to encourage that exact

1595
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,720
plan so uh from a chairs point of view i

1596
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,359
think uh elliot is absolutely correct

1597
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,680
this is a good space for that

1598
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,839
and also looking at the attended list

1599
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:57,760
there might be some potential

1600
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,760
co-conspirators

1601
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,640
thank you all and thank you elliot thank

1602
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,319
you all the presenters for uh

1603
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:07,920
yeah for

1604
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,359
attending here

1605
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:12,400
uh yeah this was a cool itf it was more

1606
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,480
stressful than usual i think i don't

1607
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,520
know why

1608
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,280
because i'm in the eu that should not be

1609
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,240
so hard

1610
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,480
but thank you all for being here in your

1611
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,079
time zones uh thank you all for

1612
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,880
attending here and see you all

1613
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,000
in march hopefully with some cabalish

1614
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,680
design team that comes up with good

1615
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,680
things

1616
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,799
you
