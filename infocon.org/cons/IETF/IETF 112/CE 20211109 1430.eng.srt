to everyone is that the the cmp v2 draft

104
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,160
needs to

105
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,080
progress uh through the rfc editor

106
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,440
in parallel with um

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,720
some other documents in lamps

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,400

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,560
so uh

176
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,400
basically

177
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,840
shall i start

178
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,840
yeah yeah sure go ahead

179
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,960
thank you

180
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,000
so

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,120
in this

182
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,240
version

183
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,560
we have integrated

184
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,000
all the comments

185
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,080
and discussions with christian carson

186
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,879
and

187
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,000
we have

188
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,840
give it also a little bit of

189
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,280
restructuring

190
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,840
and we understand that we have

191
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,200
now the version that we expected after

192
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,039
all these discussions

193
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,839
and we also added a

194
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,080
annex regarding

195
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,719
how to use graphite with tls which is

196
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,159
something that has

197
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,080
was commented but

198
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,800
we did not add something concrete

199
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,880
until now but we we added in annex so if

200
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,279
we can go to the next

201
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,399
slide we have the summary of the

202
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,360
main topics we have been

203
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,080
adding to or

204
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,360
modified in some meaningful way

205
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,240
in regard with the last version

206
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,560
so we added a some discussion about the

207
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,680
discovery of the authenticator

208
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,399
we added some of the the recommendation

209
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,480
from christian to send a resource in the

210
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
first message

211
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,240
we are also

212
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,200
sending

213
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,120
the

214
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,560
sender id and recipient id for oscor

215
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,720
instead of calculating it

216
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,200
as part of the derivation of the

217
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,440
material

218
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,720
also to

219
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,839
improve the the way of

220
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,080
choosing these these

221
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,760
identifiers

222
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,519
we confirm the the use of oscar for

223
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,959
doing the key confirmation of co-op if

224
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,440
we also added some consideration

225
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,760
for the use of proxies

226
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,839
and basically

227
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:00,880
we

228
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,720
gave a definition of a silver structure

229
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,959
to carry some information for the

230
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,720
negotiations

231
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,160
and finally we we show the current flow

232
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,880
operation and we give some comments in

233
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,519
this presentation regarding how dtls can

234
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,560
be used in in the annex so

235
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,279
in the next slide please

236
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,760
basically uh for a discovery of the ip

237
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,640
authenticator since copied is expected

238
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,640
to be used in different iot environments

239
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,360
we leave it out of the scope but we

240
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,480
added some

241
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,839
discussion of how can this be done we

242
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,600
understand that co-op

243
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,640
brings some tools to the table for

244
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,959
a resource disco

245
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,240
discovery

246
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,560
and we are using that

247
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,880
as part of co-op but

248
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,480
in terms of

249
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,519
getting the information of the ipv6 of

250
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,720
the border router or the entity in the

251
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,760
domain

252
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,480
with which the ip authenticator is going

253
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,720
to talk to we leave that out of the

254
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,480
scope but there are different approaches

255
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,480
that could be considered depending on

256
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,000
the deployment scenario such as dhcp or

257
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
multicast dns

258
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,519
so next slide please

259
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,480
so

260
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,839
one of the

261
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,000
modifications we make to the flow

262
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,440
operation to

263
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,480
to save bytes over the of the link is to

264
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,800
send in the first

265
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,600
message from the e-pier to the

266
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,360
authenticator

267
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,880
is to send in the payload the

268
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,240
uri

269
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,760
of the resource that is being created in

270
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,519
the iot device

271
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,320
for

272
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
attending the next

273
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,519
exchange

274
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,920
so this saves

275
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,720
the

276
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,320
flow operation

277
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,639
from having to use the well-known

278
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,399
uri they co-appear

279
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,920
well on uri

280
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,120
twice

281
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,880
so it is a cleaner approach

282
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,480
and the next slide

283
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,480
please another thing that we do we do is

284
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,279
to

285
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,120
send in the

286
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,279
second and the third message

287
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,399
uh

288
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,160
the uh

289
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,880
along with the ip message

290
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,680
we send in a silver structure

291
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,320
the crypto street negotiation the values

292
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,440
of the christian

293
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,839
scriptures with negotiation and we also

294
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:32,880
send

295
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,600
in the request and response the sender

296
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,160
id and response id for uh

297
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,360
oscor

298
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,240
this is uh this can all this can also be

299
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,519
reused

300
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,560
as key id for the tls as we will comment

301
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,860
in the last uh

302
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,399
[Music]

303
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,399
part of the of the presentation

304
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,440
but

305
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,160
this is the the basic idea of this

306
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
exchange

307
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,319
uh the next slide please

308
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,200
so we maintain the use of oscor in this

309
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
case in the basic

310
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,360
exchange

311
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,399
as a way of confirming that the key

312
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,000
material derived from the hip

313
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,920
authentication

314
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,079
is established correctly

315
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,160
and we

316
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,839
double down on

317
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,200
on the use of a score by establishing

318
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,279
the oscars security association that

319
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,200
could be used

320
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,440
from that point on to secure any

321
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,079
exchange between the iot device and the

322
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,519
controller

323
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,120
to do so what what we

324
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,399
propose

325
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,120
uh and also think uh i i want to take a

326
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,519
second to thank christian answers for

327
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,760
his input on this

328
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,639
uh

329
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,360
we create a a

330
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,920
a template an incomplete

331
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,160
oscore

332
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,920
security

333
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,680
context

334
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,199
that is missing the key which is

335
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,839
completed after the authentication is

336
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,760
is completed and what we do is that upon

337
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,839
reception of the if success what we do

338
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,760
is to complete

339
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,880
the

340
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,360
oscar security context

341
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,240
and

342
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,480
be able to complete the

343
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,360
key confirmation uh

344
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,720
the the

345
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,959
detail here

346
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,000
is

347
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,760
that uh

348
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,199
basically

349
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,120
we generally generate the the the needed

350
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,360
context

351
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,199
but

352
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,880
we need to use

353
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,959
the oscar message the first task or

354
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:51,920
message

355
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,600
as a alternate success indication for ip

356
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,720
because

357
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,959
the content is ciphered

358
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,560
so we use the first oscar message as an

359
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,120
alternative success indication for the

360
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,079
state machine to release the msk and

361
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,959
then complete the process

362
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,560
and with

363
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,199
the recipient and sender id that are now

364
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,240
sent

365
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,320
in the previous message we are able to

366
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,639
to complete the whole process the next

367
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,279
slide please

368
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,199
basically we also have a a brief comment

369
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,120
about the use of proxies

370
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,639
because in the exchange there is a role

371
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,000
reversal

372
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,199
in qua

373
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,920
from the first message in which the iot

374
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,199
device acts

375
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,120
as a

376
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,920
client but on the rest of the exchange

377
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,680
it is a cloud server

378
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,759
so this that is something that needs to

379
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,040
be considered when using proxies to send

380
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,920
any needed information to the controller

381
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,759
uh to be able to use the service

382
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,639
through a proxy so this this additional

383
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,519
information could be sent also in the

384
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,800
in the server structure that

385
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,560
it is defined so

386
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,839
we are preparing this structure maybe

387
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,399
the next slide i think is

388
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,560
is there

389
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,399
yes so we define a silver structure that

390
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,920
carries some of the

391
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,440
information

392
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,759
that we need to exchange

393
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,320
for cyberspeed negotiation the sender id

394
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,680
recipient id

395
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,600
also the authorization information such

396
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,399
as session lifestyle maybe we can we put

397
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,519
it as extensible so maybe we if we need

398
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,959
in the future to add some additional

399
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,079
information

400
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,320
and we can do so uh

401
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,160
in this structure to add maybe a further

402
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,880
a

403
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,440
feature or another functionality so

404
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,279
that's also integrated in the next

405
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,120
version and i think that we are close to

406
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,759
to the end in here you can see the

407
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,920
current exchange of operation

408
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,559
and now it is cleaner we have us

409
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,959
abstracted ourselves from confirmable

410
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,199
and concrete mobile messages

411
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,160
and just focused on the

412
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,119
basic

413
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,599
exchange there you can see how the

414
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,919
context is created

415
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:18,959
when the

416
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,359
negotiation is done

417
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,599
and basically when the msk is derived it

418
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,160
is used as in the in the

419
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,360
seventh message to complete the oscar

420
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,480
context

421
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,919
and to send

422
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,799
the

423
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,000
eighth message confirming the the key

424
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,559
and finishing the club exchange lastly

425
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,880
in the in the in the last

426
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,640
slide we add

427
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,200
in the annex some considerations for

428
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,400
using

429
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,720
for establishing a dtls

430
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
security association

431
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,840
that could be used instead of oscar

432
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,799
and for this we are reducing the same

433
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,320
fields as a source core we also do a

434
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,720
crypto suite negotiation for

435
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,480
for dtls

436
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,039
the key id for the dtrs pressure key is

437
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,280
generated in this case by concatenating

438
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,679
the center id and recipient id

439
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,440
and in here as

440
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,160
we do with oscor we consider the client

441
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,240
hello message from dtls

442
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,559
as an urgent exercise indication to be

443
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,080
able to to obtain from the state machine

444
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,919
the msk

445
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,120
and

446
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,280
be able to run the

447
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,720
dtis

448
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,679
so

449
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,480
that that that's it

450
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,039
thank you very much for your time

451
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,640
want to have some comments

452
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,760
yeah so so

453
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,840
from my point of view

454
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,039
um

455
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,280
the the document is ready to be shipped

456
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,039
to the isg

457
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,760
so that's uh that's to me the next step

458
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,400
for for that document so if anyone has

459
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,760
concerns

460
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,200
if anyone see any issues clarifications

461
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,000
um i mean it's time to show up um

462
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,400
and you have until then i would say the

463
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,760
end of the week to

464
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,039
to to raise your concerns

465
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,720
so i'm hearing no comments um i think

466
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,799
that the document is uh

467
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,480
pretty much ready

468
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,039
and i suggest that we move to the next

469
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,919
presentation so it's uh probably gonna

470
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,600
be marco

471
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,719
yes i can hear that

472
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,960
yeah

473
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,559
great

474
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,880
uh i can't share those lights if it's

475
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,600
okay to you yeah so you have to request

476
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,320
this okay yeah

477
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,039
do you get those

478
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,400
i think you'll have sharing as well

479
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,600
yeah uh i think yeah you have to clear

480
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,678
your sharing first before i can go on

481
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,240
so i have to

482
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,600
stop sharing

483
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,280
the slides yourself

484
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,039
oh yeah i am sharing those yeah i

485
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,880
thought

486
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,520
so i uh sharing slides

487
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,240
stop sharing slightly yeah sorry huh not

488
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,840
requested

489
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,158
okay

490
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,240
great

491
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,120
okay

492
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
i guess this should be the one

493
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,400
uh this is an update on keygroup com

494
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,240
most of this was mentioned at the latest

495
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,559
interim so uh i'll be i'll be fairly

496
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,280
quick

497
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,559
um this revision was major and it was

498
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,799
about addressing two reviews we got from

499
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,720
working group plus called uh from your

500
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,159
random sick them

501
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,120
thank you very much for that

502
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,440
and to give a recap

503
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,200
word clarifications on general

504
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,559
terminology and use and semantics of

505
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,960
some parameters and messages both in the

506
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,240
phases of token uploading to the kdc

507
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
and then later on joining process for a

508
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,120
new

509
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,320
candidate group member

510
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,480
another clarification was related to the

511
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,280
overall table of content uh since

512
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,039
texting the draft was parsed here and

513
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,039
there with a lot of repetitions so now

514
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,799
it's much more

515
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,679
linear with error handling mentioned uh

516
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,559
once and for all about its uh common

517
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,039
general part uh when introducing the kbc

518
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,520
interface and then we go through the uh

519
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,760
resources at the kdc one by one followed

520
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,159
by handler one example i'm going to

521
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,080
example um and so on

522
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,919
in terms of

523
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,919
design changes it was also agreed to

524
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,320
bring into this document the definition

525
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,159
already of some parameters that were

526
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,960
otherwise defining keygroup common score

527
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,880
where they remain used

528
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,080
and we define here some new parameters

529
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,960
for enabling uh control messages that

530
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,200
the kdc can send over multicast and in

531
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,720
particular

532
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,960
when using advanced uh group raking

533
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,240
schemes

534
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,960
and related to that also uh

535
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,520
a resource about the public key of the

536
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,919
kdc initially defining figure common

537
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,880
score was transferred here and remained

538
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,840
used there

539
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,200
uh as requested especially by iran we

540
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,000
also enforce the categorization of the

541
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,240
parameters defined in this document and

542
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,960
used in its messages as must should may

543
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,520
be supported by devices leaving some of

544
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,000
them conditional to support and leaving

545
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,039
to profiles to have a final word on this

546
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,559
as a requirement

547
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,880
and we categorize also

548
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,640
functionalities that have to be

549
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,039
minimally or additionally supported by

550
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,480
devices

551
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,400
with profiles to follow this

552
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,960
categorization also for possibly

553
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,240
even more uh new defined parameters and

554
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,640
also we also gave some more guidelines

555
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,440
on

556
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,679
error wrangling when enhanced animal

557
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,080
responses are used following overall the

558
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,159
same rationale considered in the main

559
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,960
ace framework

560
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,200
as also requested in the reviews we

561
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,120
collected all the text we had sparse in

562
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,760
the document about uh group wrecking now

563
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,240
we have a single section about that

564
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,360
introducing the overall problem and task

565
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,799
at hand

566
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,400
we introduced an optimization about

567
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,520
possibly including uh public keys of

568
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,480
just joined uh new members

569
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,159
in the working messages

570
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,240
and we give high-level guidelines and

571
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,720
examples about different approaches that

572
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,240
can be used

573
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,159
uh to perform a group routine like the

574
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,799
very basic one-to-one or one-to-many

575
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,360
using pub sub or multicast

576
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,400
but extreme details leading to actual

577
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,799
content and encoding to use on the yr

578
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,360
are up to yet other documents that

579
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,000
should describe how a particular raking

580
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,960
scheme

581
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,440
uh is used in this context possibly

582
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,559
considering

583
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,520
even the specific profile of this

584
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,000
document

585
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
uh so as a summary this version has

586
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,480
addressed all the working group last

587
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,960
call reviews as far as i can tell plus

588
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,440
additional comments we got uh during the

589
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
july meeting so we also extended

590
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,279
abstract an introduction to clarify even

591
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,240
better

592
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,320
um the the scope

593
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,919
and the goals of this document in in

594
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:32,720
this

595
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,240
group com landscape

596
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,919
and we also extended the security

597
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,600
consideration to highlight the the big

598
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,440
amount of trust that we are putting on

599
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,559
the kdc in the first place and what that

600
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,000
implies

601
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,400
i'm not aware at this point of any other

602
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,200
open

603
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,360
issues uh or open points to address uh

604
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,039
as authors so

605
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,000
we believe this is now ready for a next

606
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,840
step we should be shepherd

607
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,840
review and write up

608
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,279
that should be the last one

609
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,720
thank you

610
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,240
yeah so

611
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,640
um my comment would be similar to the

612
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,440
prison to the previous presentation

613
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,559
is that

614
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,080
this document is going to be shipped to

615
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,320
the ihg very soon so if you have any

616
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,000
concerns

617
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,919
please do raise them by the end of the

618
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,919
week

619
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,240
okay

620
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,840
i think we can go on with the next

621
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,039
presentation

622
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,360
okay

623
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,760
coming up

624
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,840
okay and this is kegro kamal score a

625
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,120
profile of the previous uh draft

626
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,360
uh specific for the use of group of

627
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,120
score in groups

628
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,200
and everything i've done for this

629
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,000
version was really uh adopting the

630
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,039
changes done in ace key group com

631
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,200
to make this trust this draft consistent

632
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,360
with the previous one so moving out

633
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,440
parameters and resources in terms of

634
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,279
their definition as i mentioned was

635
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,799
still used here

636
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,520
and a lot of alignment to be done in

637
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,480
terms of

638
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,840
terminology uh parameter semantics and

639
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,000
the optimization of possibly including

640
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,400
public keys and wreaking messages

641
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
and so on and the categorization of

642
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,120
parameters and operations

643
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,679
is now also enforced here uh and this

644
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,480
document is now overall

645
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,480
following the updated list of

646
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,279
requirements for profiles of sql.com

647
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,000
that we have now

648
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,440
uh

649
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,840
most of the clarifications that were

650
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,400
done in aceke.com were were also to be

651
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,360
done

652
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,679
again here for new parameters and

653
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,919
resources defined brand new uh in this

654
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,440
document

655
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,039
uh there was some clarification

656
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,919
requested on uh who can access what

657
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,640
resource to do what and on error

658
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,080
handling

659
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,159
and on ayana considerations but

660
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,960
relatively uh minor things i would say

661
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,320
and really to summarize i think this

662
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,600
version 12

663
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,559
is now stable version 11 was already but

664
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,520
this is now aligned with the also stable

665
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,720
and

666
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,760
versions of keygroup conforting and also

667
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,000
of the grupo score document

668
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,840
in core

669
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,760
as a reminder i have an implementation

670
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,799
of this draft for eclipse californium

671
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,960
where the group manager acting is kdc

672
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,360
supports but the group mode and pairwise

673
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,640
mode is used in the score groups

674
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,480
also about this document i'm not aware

675
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
of any further

676
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,600
remaining issues or or open points

677
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,640
uh

678
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,279
so i think uh it can be considered now

679
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,760
for uh working group plus goal

680
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,399
um as a heads up the the grouposcore

681
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,880
documenting core is also uh going to

682
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,880
approach its second working group last

683
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,120
call in fact which is good

684
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,360
but uh of course we cannot exclude all

685
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,360
together that the group will score

686
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,480
documenting core with possible uh

687
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,960
future updates is going to uh to affect

688
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,960
this document in turn to adapt something

689
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,399
it's just

690
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,480
the way it works as we keep updating the

691
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,039
documents in the later stages but right

692
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,720
now they are stable and consistent with

693
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,960
one another

694
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,440
yeah this is my last slide

695
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,000
yeah so

696
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,399
my my understanding for um

697
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,880
for this uh document is that we will

698
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,000
issue um a walking deal classical

699
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,120
uh

700
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
very shortly

701
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,919
so

702
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,000
you will have a two weeks a

703
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,520
two week window

704
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,600
to make any comment i would like um

705
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,240
people to commit to review that so

706
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,679
um

707
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,000
please um

708
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,240
i mean um

709
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,480
just um i don't want to to waste a lot

710
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,320
of time on that but

711
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,080
do we have anyone in the room that is

712
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,520
planning to review the document

713
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,000
okay current

714
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,440
it's just you want to speak

715
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,279
no i just want to review

716
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,240
okay

717
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,039
good

718
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,279
so that's uh that's very helpful

719
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,919
okay so we will go through the working

720
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,240
group last goal and um

721
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,799
thank you karen for the review and um

722
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,200
hopefully have that shipped by the end

723
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,399
of the month

724
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,799
thank you

725
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,760
thanks

726
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,960
so i know i have two more presentations

727
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,559
in the agenda but in the interest of

728
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,799
time which one should i pick

729
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,840
so um i i suggest that we

730
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,960
we focus on the new adapted um a

731
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,399
potentially new uh work item to adopt so

732
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,360
i would encourage you to to go to the

733
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,360
token

734
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,678
okay

735
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,960
yes uh i have to give an update on this

736
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,120
one it's now in version 6. i think it

737
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,000
was presented last time in november last

738
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,399
year but of course we've kept working on

739
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,120
it

740
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,760
the whole year

741
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,960
so as a recap the problem here is that

742
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,679
access tokens can of course expire but

743
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,240
can be revoked for a number of reasons

744
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,120
uh before they reach expiration time and

745
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,679
the problem is how to make this evident

746
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,760
to the involved parties so the clients

747
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,760
and resource servers

748
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,440
having an interest and involved in the

749
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,880
use of that token

750
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,720
uh you have token introspection

751
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,799
available of course but practically only

752
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,039
for um resource servers that in case

753
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,840
have to take the initiative and

754
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,279
request the authorization server to

755
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,720
introspect one token at a time

756
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,039
this document in addition so to

757
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,279
complement not really replace an

758
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,000
introspection defines a new service a

759
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,760
new interface at the authorization

760
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,120
server

761
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,760
which basically preserve uh keeps uh one

762
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,399
single resource a token revocation list

763
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,159
intended to keep

764
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,559
let's say short identifiers of tokens

765
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,799
that are revoked at the moment but not

766
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,159
yet expired

767
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,000
and then both client and authorization

768
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,320
and resource server sorry register that

769
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,320
that authorization server can access

770
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,799
that resource uh through a get operation

771
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,039
possibly observe that resource

772
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,360
uh to be informed possibly through

773
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,080
automatic notifications about

774
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,559
their pertaining access tokens that are

775
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,360
revoked but uh not expired yet and when

776
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,880
doing so they in fact retrieve

777
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,799
information only about the tokens

778
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,399
pertaining them

779
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,080
not really all of the access tokens

780
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,039
issued by the authorization server and

781
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,600
there is really no need for new ace

782
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,760
endpoints here defined that client or

783
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,240
resource server this resource is at the

784
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,720
authorization server

785
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,279
so for identifying these revoked tokens

786
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,360
to inform about we don't use the the

787
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,440
token cti or anything like that we

788
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,480
actually

789
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,399
compute the hash

790
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,679
of the token using the 6920

791
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,519
approach of naming things with with

792
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,559
hashes

793
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,399
and the hash input is the only thing

794
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,799
that all the three parties involve c as

795
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,200
identical so the value of the access

796
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,360
token parameter in the response from the

797
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,880
authorization server

798
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,880
when the token is issued

799
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,640
and the resource identization server is

800
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,519
basically a list of the token ashes of

801
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,840
the tokens that are revoked

802
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,919
but not expired yet

803
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,519
and when registering at the

804
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,919
authorization server uh the client

805
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,120
service or server learn the

806
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,360
exact url where to contact uh the

807
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,200
authorization server for

808
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,120
for the trl endpoint and well can

809
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,200
interact with it as i say to to learn

810
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,039
about the revoked access token

811
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,760
uh this can work actually in three

812
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,600
different modes of operation and the

813
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,080
first one is very simple and mandatory

814
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,159
to implement for uh the authorization

815
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,640
server uh say the client just like a

816
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,960
resource server can send a get or get

817
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,679
observed request and retrieve back all

818
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,840
uh the token ashes for the pertaining

819
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,799
token tokens that are revoked

820
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,360
there are two more advanced

821
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,440
diff query modes uh

822
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,159
so the one in the middle requests for

823
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,760
the n most recent updates uh occurred

824
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,200
most recently

825
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,559
uh to the pertaining part of the trl so

826
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,039
pertaining to to the requesting node and

827
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,640
can be supported

828
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,360
uh we developed a third mode out of

829
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,440
input from karsten about considering the

830
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,559
series transfer pattern and about then

831
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,559
i think at the november meeting uh last

832
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,360
year

833
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,679
about considering retrieving not really

834
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,080
that the end most recent updates but

835
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,279
actually the

836
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,279
the most recent updates following a

837
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,599
certain uh resumption point um in time

838
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,520
and putting things together we actually

839
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
developed this mode which is currently

840
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,320
an appendix but we have an ambition to

841
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,879
to move it up to the uh document body

842
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,280
and it's now also detailed in terms of

843
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,599
uh yeah message payload uh error

844
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,960
handling and so on

845
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,399
uh in the latest versions uh other than

846
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,440
developing the uh the stp based mode we

847
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,760
added a number of clarifications about

848
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,918
the difference modes uh the early

849
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,520
registration process and the error

850
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,560
rendering

851
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,119
we had the possible additional use of

852
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,440
the pmax attribute

853
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,520
as a query parameter when requesting to

854
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,159
observe that's something defined in the

855
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,320
co-working group and basically

856
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,918
the client original server is really

857
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,560
requesting the authorization server to

858
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,960
send observed notifications here and

859
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,760
there with maximum silence

860
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,000
maximum intervals of silence between one

861
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,839
and another

862
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,680
to be kept posted

863
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,079
and yeah we defined bit more in detail

864
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,480
in the recent versions how to

865
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,000
format the messages for the most

866
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,119
advanced

867
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,599
um operation mode

868
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:20,720
uh

869
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,359
most recent review we got or comments on

870
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,040
the list were from michael richardson

871
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,440
about a number of very useful

872
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,240
clarifications of different aspects of

873
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,480
the document that are also

874
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,320
integrated now in the latest version

875
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,599
so to sum up this is

876
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,920
an additional service that the

877
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,079
authorization server can provide to both

878
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,880
a client and resource service to um

879
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,040
inform about access tokens that are

880
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,200
revoked but not expired yet

881
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,240
and

882
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,960
that information can be accessed still

883
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,280
in a polling fashion with simple gets or

884
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,680
it can also benefit from automatic

885
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,359
notification using

886
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,200
uh co-op observe

887
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,200
uh this is building uh on input from

888
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,880
carson and then especially on the

889
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,079
advanced

890
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:10,960
mode

891
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,960
recent comments from michael and if you

892
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,520
uh go back to old versions of the draft

893
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,839
we really built uh on initial comments

894
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,680
from jim and the review uh from trevi

895
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,040
spencer

896
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,560
the big mess that we have in mind is

897
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,640
moving the third most advanced mode of

898
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,040
operation up to the document body and to

899
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,200
integrate it better with the other two

900
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,760
to make everything look more

901
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,400
homogeneous but um otherwise we think

902
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,200
the document is is stable in its latest

903
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,520
version and i'm aware of an ongoing

904
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,480
implementation from a cnr

905
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,880
uh research institute in italy they are

906
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,200
building on our implementation of va's

907
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,760
framework on eclipse california and i'm

908
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,320
assisting with that

909
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,480
so overall we believe

910
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,079
uh this isn't a good shape to be

911
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,760
considered

912
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,520
to be adopted as a working document

913
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,760
okay so

914
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,160
anyone um

915
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,400
i'm just um

916
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,640
i'd just like to understand how many

917
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,880
people have read one of the version of

918
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,760
that document

919
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,119
please just uh

920
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,599
raise your hands

921
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,320
some are also mentioned in in this draft

922
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,000
in this slide sorry

923
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,480
yeah yeah well what is worth

924
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,680
and um

925
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,200
um

926
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,280
how many people would like to to review

927
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,800
that document

928
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,520
if adopted

929
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,839
christians is willing to review in the

930
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,839
chat

931
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,960
okay anyone is opposed to this draft

932
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,160
moving

933
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,160
forward

934
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,070
[Music]

935
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,640
okay so i'm hearing no position so

936
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,520
um i would start a call for adoption

937
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,200
please um

938
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,960
do state whether

939
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,160
you're in favor or against uh very

940
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,598
clearly so that we can um

941
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,079
we can be something else in a parking

942
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,960
lot for um document

943
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,480
okay so

944
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,760
thank you um marco thank you

945
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,400
um i suggest that we

946
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,839
we do um

947
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,880
a presentation on um

948
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,680
the

949
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,520
tns

950
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,760
oscar profile

951
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,280
and that we

952
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,680
we then switch back to the um

953
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,119
to the gm admin

954
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,800
from marco if time permits

955
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,680
and i suppose we will have time for that

956
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,400
okay thank you

957
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,800
so i'm joran salander and i'm going to

958
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,640
talk about this draft this is just once

959
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,599
this presentation is just one slide long

960
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,079
and you see the title of the of the sl

961
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,920
draft here the

962
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,280
the purpose of this draft is to discuss

963
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,119
the applicability of

964
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,280
another draft uh

965
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,359
with the dtls profile

966
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,359
of the ace framework to tls

967
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,200
and the content of the draft this was

968
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,960
submitted late i should say so it was

969
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,960
in in the two week weeks period between

970
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,960
the submission deadline and

971
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,000
and the meeting and we just uploaded uh

972
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,680
that on monday

973
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,520
uh as a compensation this is a very

974
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,119
short draft so the content is

975
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,119
essentially what stated in this

976
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,000
slide it's saying that

977
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
the dtls profile of ace applies to tls

978
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,319
as well as dtls

979
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,160
and we could use the same access token

980
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,160
the same profile

981
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,400
so that's the content of this draft and

982
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,880
and the rationale for using this is

983
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,680
for example in in case uh udp might be

984
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,920
blocked and you would rather use

985
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,119
uh

986
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,720
tls and tcp

987
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,839
for

988
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,880
nat and firewall traversal for example

989
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,480
and there is another context as well and

990
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,480
that's the um

991
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,440
that 3dpp has started looking at

992
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,000
i think the use of co-op and in this

993
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,920
service-based architecture where they

994
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,319
all already have adopted tls 1.3 and

995
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,800
oauth 2.0

996
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,119
and when they now add co-op to this

997
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,400
setting

998
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,440
ace makes a natural

999
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,119
a natural solution to the authorization

1000
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,359
problem

1001
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,680
so that's basically my presentation and

1002
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,200
and the question

1003
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,760
is for the working group is uh first of

1004
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,440
all do you think this is

1005
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,200
uh do you like this do you agree with

1006
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,160
this

1007
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,399
this procedure of having a uh

1008
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,720
a statement just about applicability of

1009
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,520
something um do we need a separate draft

1010
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,960
can we solve it in some other way could

1011
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,400
we could we

1012
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,240
for instance consider including this

1013
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,119
sentence or this paragraph

1014
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,680
in the ace details authorized

1015
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,040
draft

1016
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,680
which is currently in auth 48 so it's

1017
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,480
it's kind of late

1018
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,160
yep that's my question

1019
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,040
thank you

1020
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,160
any

1021
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,640
any spontaneous answers do we have an ad

1022
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,400
in the meeting at the moment

1023
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,200
i think we have two ladies in the

1024
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,680
meeting at the moment

1025
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,599
um

1026
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,880
so i mean

1027
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,280
yes you're right from a technical sense

1028
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,520
we could pull the

1029
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,400
details profile back from all 48 and try

1030
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400
to add to it

1031
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,400
uh but that's a pretty heavy hammer at

1032
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,640
this point and i feel like i would want

1033
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,760
to

1034
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,280
redo like the last call process and get

1035
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,160
some

1036
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,040
uh visibility into the iesg about it and

1037
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,119
i'm fairly reluctant to take that

1038
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,560
approach

1039
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,319
i guess i'm not going to rule it out

1040
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,240
entirely but i think there is a fair bit

1041
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,200
of overhead and

1042
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,480
i would want to get a fair bit of review

1043
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,280
to try and get this change in at such a

1044
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,160
late stage and so my preference would be

1045
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,359
to

1046
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:36,720
not do that

1047
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,440
and

1048
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,400
yes it feels a little silly to do a

1049
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,599
two-page document but sometimes it might

1050
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,720
be the right choice

1051
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,200
i'm also happy to hear if there are

1052
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,160
other opinions in the room

1053
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,240
please john

1054
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,119
yeah i was would it really need the last

1055
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,040
call

1056
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,640
isd added dtls 1.3 without having a last

1057
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,800
call i would say that's actually a

1058
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,200
bigger change than this change this

1059
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,160
would

1060
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,680
i don't see any

1061
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,319
the draft before mention some dtls one

1062
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,640
or two details which have now been fixed

1063
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,520
but for the tls i don't think there's

1064
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,760
any changes needed at all then you're

1065
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,319
saying what this drop does that this

1066
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,440
also works for tls

1067
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,160
right

1068
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,960
like it looks like there's no changes

1069
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,839
needed

1070
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,920
but i i feel like i would want the

1071
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,920
review to confirm that there are no

1072
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,760
changes needed

1073
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,680
because sometimes there can be subtle

1074
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,839
differences between tls and dtls that

1075
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,079
come up

1076
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,079
i don't have an example off the top of

1077
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,680
my head because it's early in the

1078
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,599
morning today but i feel like there have

1079
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,599
been some cases when i'm doing isg

1080
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,599
review of other documents

1081
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,200
where they

1082
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,359
they want to combine them together and

1083
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,440
there's some subtle difference that

1084
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,839
needs special treatment

1085
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,760
usually i think that would show up when

1086
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,520
you start with tls and you're trying to

1087
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,000
add dtls

1088
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,280
less clear what the issues would be

1089
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,480
going the other direction but i

1090
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,160
i think there's enough of a risk that i

1091
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,880
don't want to just

1092
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,560
make the change at the last minute

1093
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,480
without actually giving it some thought

1094
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,359
okay fair enough thanks thanks for that

1095
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,119
what so what's your proposal do you want

1096
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,760
to review this and then make a decision

1097
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,520
or is the decision

1098
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,359
or your at least your strong

1099
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,000
recommendation here that we go for

1100
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,359
uh making it separate draft

1101
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,240
uh

1102
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,760
so i guess my

1103
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,160
q is currently a little bit long so i

1104
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,400
think my recommendation would be to go

1105
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,839
ahead and adopt this draft

1106
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,480
and if i happen to have the time to look

1107
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,480
at it sooner we could maybe

1108
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,319
short circuit that process but i think

1109
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,720
adopting this draft would be a

1110
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,800
reliable process that we can get started

1111
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,960
on now and

1112
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,040
would not be blocking on me indefinitely

1113
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,440
okay

1114
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,160
okay thank you then i'm i'm done with

1115
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,000
the presentation

1116
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,680
so um

1117
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,200
one thing um

1118
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,560
it's not clear um to me

1119
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,640
if it has been said but um

1120
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,920
um

1121
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,880
to

1122
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,920
a little bit of context

1123
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,160
my understanding is that the request to

1124
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,760
extend the dtls profile to tls

1125
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,040
i mean to address the tls use case

1126
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,720
has been raised by 3gpp

1127
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,560
and so

1128
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,880
my recommendation is that we had we

1129
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,640
start

1130
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,560
a working group adoption for this

1131
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,920
document

1132
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,920
and move that document pretty

1133
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,280
i mean pretty fast so i would like to

1134
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,599
have a lot of people to

1135
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,440
review this

1136
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,040
document that is shorter than the slide

1137
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,000
so just as a

1138
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,040
short questions i would like to see

1139
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,680
how many people have read or willing to

1140
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,920
review this document

1141
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,960
please

1142
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,440
raise your hand

1143
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,960
so we have only one person

1144
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,880
okay

1145
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,800
anyone opposed to that document to be

1146
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,200
okay

1147
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,200
so i

1148
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,000
i'm gonna start with a call for adoption

1149
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,599
um

1150
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,640
um keep in mind that we we need to

1151
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,040
when we adopt a document we need to make

1152
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,839
to have a sufficient confidence that

1153
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,119
um the document is gonna end to

1154
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:38,960
to um be thrown to the isgs so um

1155
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,119
similarly to the previous document

1156
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,079
uh clearly state whether you're um

1157
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,640
you're gonna review the document or you

1158
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,720
support it and um

1159
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,800
and we will see how

1160
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,720
it goes um i think we have time for

1161
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,800
marco for your last gm presentation so

1162
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,599
please go ahead

1163
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,920
great

1164
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,079
so i requested

1165
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,040
uh

1166
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,559
sharing powers can you grant them to me

1167
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,000
oh yeah

1168
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,040
thank you

1169
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,319
do you have it

1170
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,960
yes

1171
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,240
there we are

1172
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,680
okay um

1173
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,640
this is also um an update about oscar

1174
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,720
germany now version 4 and i think this

1175
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,520
was also presented last time november

1176
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,759
last year

1177
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,559
to recap this is uh another restful

1178
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,800
interface at the same oscore group

1179
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,920
manager

1180
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,599
of the keygroup

1181
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:44,720
draft

1182
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,040
but this interface is intended for

1183
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,119
administrator users

1184
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,480
to create delete configure reconfigure

1185
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,319
uh the oscar groups that that group

1186
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,760
manager

1187
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,440
is responsible for

1188
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,160
and right now we are already supporting

1189
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,000
interactions based both on link format

1190
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,119
and sybor or with corel

1191
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,240
in

1192
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,319
bottom line at the group manager this

1193
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,000
interface exports

1194
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,880
a single root resource for the sake of

1195
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,200
creating new group configurations and

1196
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,280
retrieving the current list

1197
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,160
um and when a group is created you have

1198
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,119
a child resource of this

1199
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:24,960
of this root resource

1200
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,640
the child resource is associated with a

1201
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,280
specifically accreted group and and

1202
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,760
contains as value the configuration uh

1203
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,079
currently used for that group clearly

1204
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,240
here the ace client is the administrator

1205
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,599
and the resource server is again the

1206
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,160
group manager

1207
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,040
and to put all the functionalities in

1208
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,839
one slide again the root resource allows

1209
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,400
the administrator to

1210
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,640
create a new group or retrieve the list

1211
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,440
of existing groups all of them or part

1212
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,920
of them using a fetch with a filtering

1213
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,359
criteria

1214
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,920
and then for each child resource

1215
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,400
associated to a particular oscar group

1216
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,160
you can retrieve the current

1217
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,640
configuration so the list of parameters

1218
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,960
describing how that group works all of

1219
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,000
them or part of the answer fetch you can

1220
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,920
entirely override the current

1221
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,079
configuration with a new one using uh

1222
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,040
put

1223
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,920
or as recently introduced you can use a

1224
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,720
patch for just selectively updating that

1225
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,960
configuration altering only some

1226
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,200
parameters or you can delete all

1227
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,040
together the group configuration thus

1228
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,200
deleting uh the

1229
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,720
uh oscar group altogether

1230
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,599
uh

1231
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,760
what updates have we introduced in the

1232
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,040
last three versions um error endling got

1233
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,960
improved mostly for the sake of chasing

1234
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,760
how that uh changed in in ace group com

1235
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,599
from which we are reusing

1236
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:50,319
again the same uh content format and

1237
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,839
rational for parameters and their

1238
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:56,160
semantics we started to seriously build

1239
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,319
on on an idea that uh christian

1240
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,800
triggered when this document started

1241
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,240
about having

1242
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,040
multiple administrators not only one

1243
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,960
that can have to do with the same oscar

1244
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,440
group and the direction we are taking

1245
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,640
now is that

1246
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,000
you have for sure a primary

1247
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,480
administrator that creates a group

1248
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,800
configuration and can do anything on

1249
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,960
that but at the same time you can also

1250
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,839
have additional um

1251
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:23,599
secondary administrators that

1252
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,040
might be allowed to do at least

1253
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,119
something uh on on the group

1254
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,040
configuration they didn't create uh

1255
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,240
themselves

1256
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,960
and to practically enforce this it is

1257
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,760
about defining the semantics of

1258
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,839
the scope we have in the access token

1259
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,640
for this uh kind of application and we

1260
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,359
are not done yet but we have sketched

1261
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,520
uh the technical direction we are taking

1262
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,160
already in a section we currently have

1263
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,160
as a placeholder and that requires more

1264
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,399
work

1265
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,880
uh otherwise as i mentioned we have

1266
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,040
recently introduced the possibility to

1267
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,240
perform a selective update on the

1268
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,640
configuration on the oscar group um

1269
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,400
through uh patch

1270
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,920
and while if you do a put you really

1271
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,839
override all together a group

1272
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,079
configuration and if you don't specify

1273
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,319
some parameter you fall for default

1274
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:15,359
values

1275
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,160
uh with patch you really act on the only

1276
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,880
parameters you specify uh

1277
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,440
making them take the exact new value you

1278
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,800
specify

1279
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,880
uh it's pretty straightforward for most

1280
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,240
of the parameters it's really about

1281
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,720
specifying the pair parameter name new

1282
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,440
parameter value there's an exception for

1283
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,480
a structured parameter up groups which

1284
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,200
is a list of names or a list of strings

1285
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,520
if you want to think of that

1286
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,359
so it's a bit more tricky with with

1287
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,160
patch but we we have also defined how

1288
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,040
that can be um handled uh you basically

1289
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,160
have two possible ways uh each with pros

1290
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,480
and cons uh you can't combine them in

1291
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,920
the same request

1292
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,000
uh but you can choose what better fits

1293
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,240
uh the particular request ahead

1294
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,160
uh

1295
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,480
also we improved a bit how default

1296
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,280
values uh are handled speaking of which

1297
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,760
uh as i said when creating a group or

1298
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,160
overriding its configuration

1299
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,000
if a parameter is not specified the

1300
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,160
group manager is supposed to consider a

1301
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,319
recommended default value

1302
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:22,319
in case for some strong reason the group

1303
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,319
manager doesn't do that

1304
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,559
and goes for a different value than the

1305
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,640
recommended default one

1306
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,559
uh the chosen value assigned to the

1307
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,040
parameter has to be included in the

1308
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,800
response given back

1309
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,440
to the administrator that's good for for

1310
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,520
consistency and good knowledge

1311
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,319
and also for possible follow-up uh

1312
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,559
registrations at the resource directory

1313
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,720
for group discovery but the details are

1314
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,400
all in the draft

1315
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,400
we have also defined some new

1316
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,800
configuration parameters for the oscar

1317
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,319
groups in case those oscar groups

1318
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,559
allow the usage of

1319
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,280
cachability of responses protected

1320
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,319
with oscar and that mechanism is defined

1321
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:05,599
in another

1322
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,839
code draft here we just defined the

1323
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:11,280
parameters uh describing how the group

1324
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,319
works in that respect so that

1325
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,160
that information can be consistently

1326
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,880
provided to uh to join in nodes

1327
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,040
when they join through the

1328
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,480
join interface defined in the other

1329
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,599
document

1330
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:26,240
this reference here to korkashabaloskar

1331
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,640
is informative at the moment i think it

1332
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,119
can remain for informative because for

1333
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,040
the sake of this document you don't

1334
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,559
really need to understand how the

1335
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,680
mechanics of kashaboloskar really work

1336
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,559
you just need to pick up those two

1337
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,280
concepts here mapped into two parameters

1338
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,359
so hopefully that can indeed remain an

1339
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,520
informative reference

1340
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,079
uh but i'm happy to hear uh feedback in

1341
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,280
the other

1342
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,880
direction in case

1343
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,760
um

1344
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,440
other than this it was mostly about

1345
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,119
keeping this document

1346
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,119
up to date and the line to changes

1347
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,359
happening in document related to it

1348
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:04,480
meaning keygroup com kyogre muscle

1349
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,280
and the group of score documents in core

1350
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,920
so that's just a summary of what i've

1351
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,559
just said for your convenience uh of

1352
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,480
course we are not done yet

1353
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,960
i think the main next step is

1354
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,200
defining in detail the semantics we want

1355
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,000
for for scope in the tokens here so that

1356
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,599
we can enable

1357
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,960
both a primary administrator creating a

1358
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,720
group and doing whatever it wants with

1359
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,119
that but also possibly additional

1360
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,280
secondary administrator that can do

1361
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,640
something

1362
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,440
on groups they didn't create themselves

1363
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,599
uh and again we have a direction

1364
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,240
sketched uh pretty well in in the draft

1365
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,480
already but i was hoping that a

1366
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,559
discussion a bit more in detail around

1367
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,520
this to get early feedback can happen

1368
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,000
at some of the next um asynchrony

1369
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,720
meeting if possible

1370
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,040
and just get early feedback

1371
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,720
and

1372
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,160
that's it i think

1373
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,160
comments input are welcome of course

1374
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,680
any any comment please christian

1375
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,400
um just briefly on the topic of the

1376
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,559
informative reference to deterministic

1377
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,119
score if that doesn't work out as an

1378
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,440
informative reference um it should be

1379
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,440
possible to just remove that part and

1380
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,200
move that part over to deterministic all

1381
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,559
score where it would then be published

1382
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:29,680
later

1383
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,960
so

1384
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,559
i don't expect any showstopper there

1385
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,920
yeah i i made a first attempt here

1386
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,640
because having this in the cacheable

1387
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,799
oscar document would require to bring up

1388
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,280
a lot of context from this draft that

1389
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,680
could could make the document a bit

1390
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,160
heavier but yeah in case we can go for

1391
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,359
it

1392
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,920
it's it's i prefer it to be here

1393
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,839
but if it doesn't work out

1394
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:56,839
we can do

1395
00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:00,640
that thank you

1396
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:04,880
okay

1397
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,680
so um

1398
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,520
i think we we've had we've um we have

1399
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,480
three minutes left so um

1400
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,599
i'd like to give those three minutes to

1402
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,400

1424
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,200
i was trying to clear out my publication

1425
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,160
queue

1426
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,520
uh in the week

1427
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,240
weeks leading up to this meeting but i

1428
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,000
actually got a little bit sick and that

1429
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,240
really disrupted my

1430
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,720
my pace through the queue so i'm feeling

1431
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,599
better now and i hope to continue uh

1432
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,480
