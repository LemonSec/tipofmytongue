1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,000
adam your driving slides right

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,240
that's right

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,240
trying to remember all the icons are

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,400
here for

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,198
getting the slide started

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,520
second from the left adam will get you

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,280
the repo from the data tracker

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,640
the second left for me is gallery view

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,239
uh under

10
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,559
beneath your name

11
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,559
in the upper left-hand corner

12
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,839
ah thank you very much

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,920
so it's my first time sharing with meat

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,520
echo and

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,200
i'm not sure exactly what i'm supposed

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,479
to be seeing

17
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,840
the uh

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,880
icon is lit up

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,439
but i'm not actually seeing any slides

20
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,040
myself and

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,079
um we can see the slides

22
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,759
so i think you're good to go if you want

23
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,840
to turn on video you can

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,520
adam you probably need to click on the

25
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,280
interview and uh

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,600
the the icon on the on the left on the

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,159
upper right stuff ah thank you there's

28
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,840
the problem

29
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,280
okay

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,479
just a little bit of a learning curve

31
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,000
here

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
all right so we're a couple minutes past

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,520
the top of the hour here so i think it's

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,000
time to go ahead and get started

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
you're in the pro ball which should come

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,399
as no surprise

37
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,040
right there there we go so we're going

38
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,399
to start off

39
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,360
with the traditional note well

40
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,038
if this is a surprise to you it

41
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,959
shouldn't be

42
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,360
this is basically saying if you know of

43
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,480
any uh

44
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,480
patent rights associated with anything

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,920
that you discuss

46
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,239
there are obligations that are described

47
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,360
in

48
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,040
bcp 79

49
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,760
please go read it and also behave

50
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,200
yourself that's basically the the

51
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,000
general just here

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,800
so we have uh peterson andre has

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,959
volunteered to take notes initially he

54
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,080
was going to take it for half of the

55
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,640
session but he just very kindly stepped

56
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,160
up for the entire session so we're good

57
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,959
there

58
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,280
um traditionally we have a jabber scribe

59
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,120
for those folks who

60
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,120
are not on audio but want to ask

61
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,800
questions do we have someone who can

62
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,480
just monitor the chat in case there's

63
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,239
someone who for whatever technical

64
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,080
reason can't speak

65
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,920
needs to have a question taken to the

66
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,920
microphone

67
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,200
okay i think i see chris saying yes

68
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,760
we agreed

69
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,480
thank you very much

70
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,280
all right so

71
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,040
overall agenda

72
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,319
we have um we're gonna start out with uh

73
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,400
25 minutes from ecker talking about ppm

74
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,599
and how it's different from what we've

75
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,879
done before

76
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,799
we're going to go through use cases from

77
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,120
a handful of folks

78
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,720
and then talk about how this relates to

79
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,280
some work going on in the cfrg research

80
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,400
group

81
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,840
after that we're going to have a bit

82
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,200
more discussion

83
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,120
around the charter and expressions of

84
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,400
interest

85
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,959
does anyone want to suggest changes to

86
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,000
the agenda we have here

87
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,959
all right hearing no objection um just a

88
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,480
few notes on this this is a working

89
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,159
group forming buff the goal is to make

90
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,159
sure that everyone understands what the

91
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,720
problem is that we're trying to solve

92
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,080
and we're going to talk about

93
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,720
uh potential solutions here but we're

94
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,799
not going to try to like improve those

95
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,720
solutions or anything along those lines

96
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,840
we'll be taking questions for

97
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,959
clarification after the first

98
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,120
presentation that explains the problem

99
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,000
and then we're going to have four

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,639
presentations on associated use cases

101
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,079
we're going to ask that the questions on

102
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,440
the use cases are held until after the

103
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,800
four speakers are done because they're

104
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,160
fairly short slots and we want to get

105
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,840
through them quickly and those are going

106
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,520
to be for clarification and then we're

107
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,199
going to talk about as i mentioned

108
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,040
previously how this relates to some work

109
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,960
going on in the cfrg

110
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,720
and then we have almost an hour at the

111
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,199
end here to talk about

112
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,120
the charter for the working group and

113
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,560
general discussion

114
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560
to provide input for the security ads

115
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,600
and for the iasg

116
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,120
all right so we're going to go ahead and

117
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,639
hop on to

118
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,400
echo's presentation here so i group you

119
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,359
could grab the slides

120
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,759
slides but it does not seem to be having

121
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,960
any impact so i think you have to do

122
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,280
something

123
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,360
um

124
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,360
see

125
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,960
there we go

126
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,280
yeah

127
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,240
fantastic

128
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,479
i actually um despite what it says on

129
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,479
the uh on the agenda i'm going to merge

130
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,600
the discussion of the things we're

131
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,120
trying to accomplish with the discussion

132
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,199
of technology um because i think it's

133
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,360
easier to understand the motivating

134
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,639
cases so i'll just fold them right in

135
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,639
rather having a separate use cases uh

136
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,039
presentation um

137
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,720
so uh um

138
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,320
i'll say i sent a link

139
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,520
i've written up quite a bunch of

140
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,880
interactive material on this so if

141
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,240
people want to read that i sent a link

142
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,919
in the java chat um

143
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,600
um and obviously something is unclear

144
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,240
please stop me and and you know ask

145
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,199
um

146
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,560
so okay let's move on

147
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,160
um so

148
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,840
let's just start so here's just like the

149
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,039
traditional like this is what i'm going

150
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,039
to talk about kind of in order um first

151
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,880
i want to talk about like the kinds of

152
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,080
things like one actually wants to

153
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
measure in these typical settings then

154
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,520
i'll talk about um something called

155
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,720
anonymous measurement which is like one

156
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,319
approach you might take to it and then i

157
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,759
want to talk about um the kind of

158
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,120
multi-party cryptographic techniques

159
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,880
that are the focus of this um of this

160
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,800
buff um and then i'll sort of talk about

161
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,000
the technical architecture for the

162
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,759
protocol that we sort of developed that

163
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,000
are hoping to you know pull in in this

164
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,759
work

165
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,199
um

166
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,319
that's what all aside posting i'm

167
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,840
planning to do so there's a lot of

168
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,440
situations where like one would like to

169
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,479
learn about

170
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,240
people right um you know we have like

171
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,000
the the census um or you know there's a

172
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,080
lot of public research um you know and

173
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,160
you learn things like demographics and

174
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,840
you know people's income um you know

175
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,919
maybe they have medical issues um you

176
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,520
know companies want to do um product

177
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,360
development so see what features that um

178
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,680
you know people use and don't use um how

179
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,360
much they use them like are the products

180
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,440
not working in some way um and then you

181
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,560
also want to take like behavioral

182
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,800
measurements like like so um you know

183
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,080
say you want to discover like new

184
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,520
websites that no one knows about or what

185
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,800
information people care about so you can

186
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,479
tune your product to be like more like

187
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,960
what people actually want um uh so i

188
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,560
mean there was a good example of this on

189
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,240
the other day um

190
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,639
uh um when brave did some posting about

191
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,080
like their research engine and how they

192
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,280
like want to discover websites for the

193
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,520
search engine um

194
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,880
so um

195
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,319
um so all these problems involve like

196
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,360
collecting data um

197
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,039
um the information of course is like

198
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,759
very useful but it also um is you know

199
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,759
can be very very sensitive um you know

200
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,280
people often don't want to and shouldn't

201
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,639
have to disclose you know their medical

202
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,400
issues in order in order we want to

203
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,599
learn how many people have some medical

204
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,240
condition um you know that's that's good

205
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,440
because we want to know you know where

206
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,639
where funding should be targeted for

207
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,160
instance but we don't want to know what

208
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,919
individuals have like you know medical

209
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,000
conditions that's exactly this right um

210
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,199
same thing is true for your income

211
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,520
official orientation all those things um

212
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,080
uh someone is unmuted amazed peter um if

213
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,960
you could

214
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,039
um i know it's not me because i'm not

215
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,840
typing um um and um you know it turns

216
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,360
out that like not only the things you

217
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,879
naturally think of sensitive sensitive

218
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,400
but even like much less sensitive data

219
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,840
can be very appealing and of course this

220
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,000
is like how ad targeting works um and it

221
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,319
turns out that there's like a lot of um

222
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,280
a lot of like evidence that um you can

223
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,680
put like less sensitive data together um

224
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,240
this is often called like um uh um high

225
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,400
dimensional sparse data sets and figure

226
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,360
things out that people would be

227
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,720
surprised and so i had this this is you

228
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,879
know from an article a few years ago um

229
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,879
about you know target inferring um you

230
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,680
know

231
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,360
a girl was pregnant um by like looking

232
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,560
at her other other person behavior um so

233
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,440
um

234
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,160
there's been a lot of uh um you know uh

235
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,919
research on this um

236
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,479
and one would hope to do better

237
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,919
um and so like the historical way that

238
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,080
um you know one

239
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,240
does these things is that you just

240
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,839
gather all the data and then you promise

241
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,399
not to disclose it um and you know this

242
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,600
is like um not working out super well um

243
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,120
you know data breaches um there's this

244
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,320
the famous case of the census

245
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,399
information we use for targeting um

246
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,160
japanese americans during world war ii

247
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,000
um and so generally you better have a

248
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,279
system that does not involve just like

249
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,959
trusting someone to like handle the data

250
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,120
appropriately um

251
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,360
so the good news is that actually the

252
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,440
data that you want to know

253
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,360
is not necessarily sensitive

254
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,600
um the data you want to know is usually

255
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,839
what's called aggregates so say you

256
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,120
wanted the distribution of people's

257
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,040
income maybe in a particular region or

258
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,080
maybe you want to look at their

259
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,839
relationship between like income and

260
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,760
height which by the way there is one um

261
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,640
or you want to know what the most

262
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,080
popular websites are but i don't care

263
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
like what lists any individual goes to

264
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,480
what i care about is like what says

265
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,160
people aggregate go to and in fact it's

266
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,839
often not useful to learn the websites

267
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,279
that an individual goes to because maybe

268
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,640
a lot of them are like cardinality i

269
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,120
don't like popular um often you need to

270
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,800
like slice the data in multiple ways so

271
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,000
you say um look i just want to look at a

272
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,600
given region or when i compare two

273
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,200
variables i want to regress them against

274
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,920
each other so in these cases um you know

275
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,519
it's as i say it's actually not useful

276
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,000
to have um to have the individual data

277
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,760
um beyond what lets you compute these

278
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,080
aggregate metrics and um and of course

279
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,680
it's very harmful to digital data if you

280
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,600
misuse it and from the perspective of a

281
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,000
researcher not only um you know it's not

282
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,800
just a matter of um

283
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,040
it's not just a matter of uh

284
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,880
uh of harmful but it's a matter of

285
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,320
dangerous because now you have to have

286
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,519
all sorts of controls and procedures

287
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,800
around hand on the data that make it

288
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
very hard to work with um and of course

289
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,040
also it makes it people unwilling to you

290
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,079
know share the data with you if they

291
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:14,880
know if they think you're not gonna

292
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,920
handle responsibly so um you know while

293
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,519
there are situations in which it is

294
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,000
necessary to gather full data and then

295
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,920
just say look you have to trust me um

296
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,040
those are these are ones we should look

297
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,880
forward rather than foster

298
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,120
um

299
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,800
so

300
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,880
um i want to tell you a little bit about

301
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,000
the kinds of

302
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,240
kind of output measurements um you might

303
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,680
want um

304
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,880
uh there's a number of common

305
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,839
measurement tasks um that um that we're

306
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,519
hoping to achieve in this working group

307
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,040
um so the first is what's often called a

308
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,640
simple aggregates this is the stuff you

309
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,040
would like learn in an interest s class

310
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,519
of you know um you know uh uh single

311
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,640
figures

312
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,480
group statistics that capture some data

313
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,440
so mean median sum histograms i think um

314
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,399
then there's sort of like um you know uh

315
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,839
relationships between values um

316
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,519
correlation coefficients um ordinary

317
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,240
these squares um that kind of stuff um

318
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,880
and um um you know people talk like

319
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,000
federally machine learning that's kind

320
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,440
of out of scope for this but um simple

321
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,480
stuff is in scope um and um and then

322
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,240
there's um this specific problem that's

323
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,519
often called heavy hitters which is

324
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,200
collecting uh common strings that a lot

325
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,560
of people have that turns out to be a

326
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,839
very useful technique for a number of

327
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,200
number settings

328
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,040
um so like i said you can notice it

329
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,399
these are all like the aggregate things

330
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,920
i don't depend on any anybody's

331
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,399
individual data um so we just like to

332
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,160
find some way to gather those these

333
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,920
aggregates without having to be infected

334
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,200
by people's individual data which is

335
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,600
like basically toxic waste at some level

336
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,360
um

337
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,880
so like let me give you like one

338
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,120
motivating use case um it's very useful

339
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,200
to know what kind of sites users visit

340
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,120
um because then um if you're like a web

341
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,720
browser so that our backlight use case

342
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,760
if you're like web browser you like to

343
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,800
know what kinds of sites people visit so

344
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,240
you can make your web browser work well

345
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,560
on those sites and so you can spend and

346
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,920
spend time saying okay but people like

347
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,519
really watch a lot of videos like making

348
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,440
video where they work is important um

349
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,800
now we have like some data on this

350
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,720
because we collect like mechanical data

351
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,000
uh but like for obvious reasons um it's

352
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
unattractive to know like what topics

353
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,360
any individual is interested in because

354
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,120
on this topic some of those topics are

355
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,720
you know implicate um information they

356
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,120
don't want us to have um and you know

357
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,360
it's it's very difficult to obviously

358
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,639
know exactly what these people go to as

359
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,839
problematic but even knowing the

360
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,040
interest people have is problematic

361
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,279
basically further things about them and

362
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,320
um

363
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,680
and so there's been a lot of work and

364
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,959
and trying to figure out like exactly

365
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,160
what information is sensitive and what

366
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,600
information is not extremely difficult

367
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,040
because in some cases like some

368
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,160
interests are sensitive and in some

369
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,440
cases people think they're just not

370
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,200
sensitive and so um there's been a lot

371
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,839
of talk about this um in the ads context

372
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,320
of like what topics are safe um but like

373
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,680
in ideal world if you didn't care about

374
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,880
privacy what you want to do is like

375
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,399
bucket the sites by topic and then count

376
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,600
the number of like minutes but on each

377
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,279
topic um but like i said we can't just

378
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,360
do that but so this is another problem

379
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,120
statement is to collect the distribution

380
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,639
of time spent on each type of site

381
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,480
without actually seeing the um

382
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
individualized people on

383
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,680
um

384
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,839
so that's like one motive in this case

385
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,519
another one of the use case again for a

386
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,480
browser um is to see which websites are

387
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,320
having problems of one kind or another

388
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,120
um in some cases these problems are um

389
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,720
i guess innocuous um so like web

390
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,240
compatibility is a big problem some

391
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,760
sites just don't render properly and

392
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,680
like mozilla operates like a thing which

393
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,880
you can press in the upper right hand

394
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,079
corner of your browser somewhere that

395
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,560
says like this site is broken from me um

396
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,600
uh but like but we depend pretty heavily

397
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,279
on people volunteering information

398
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,320
because we obviously don't want to

399
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,880
collect what url everybody's going to um

400
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,320
this is like a bigger problem for

401
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,920
surprisers with smaller market shares

402
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,200
because things will often work on like

403
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,199
one engine or not another um so in many

404
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,560
cases we can detect breakers on the

405
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,399
client we know that something's wrong

406
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,920
like they try to use a property we know

407
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,440
it doesn't exist or the user is saying

408
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,920
reload constantly like rage clicking but

409
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,199
you can't do anything about it because

410
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,639
like the browser knows but it can't tell

411
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,360
us

412
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,160
um

413
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,040
and so that's one example um

414
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,440
another example is um that we know

415
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,480
there's a lot of like what's called

416
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,160
fingerprinting going on so a lot of web

417
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,880
tracking happens with um

418
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,320
cookies but there's a lot of which

419
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,199
happens without cookies and um and so

420
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,800
what you do is you like have a bunch of

421
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,320
javascript apis and you can measure how

422
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,920
the browser behaves under the job sheet

423
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,000
apis um so an example people often talk

424
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,959
about is what's called canvas

425
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,279
fingerprinting where you like render

426
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,639
some fonts and then you read back from

427
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,839
the canvas and that gives you

428
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,279
information about like the gpu that

429
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,279
machine uses machine so you can use this

430
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,920
to build up a like single value which

431
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,760
you can use use like follow the user on

432
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,839
the internet um so this is like a big

433
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,360
front tracking that is not addressed by

434
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,519
the kinds of you know third-party cookie

435
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,199
blocking the browsers like firefox and

436
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,360
chrome do um this is again off

437
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,560
detectable on the client because you're

438
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,240
like why is this person like doing a lot

439
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,600
of canvas read back so when like they're

440
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,560
not actually displaying anything

441
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,720
meaningful and or like they're actually

442
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,240
loading some some some like script which

443
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,240
you know is a tracking script um but you

444
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,440
just can't like report it back for

445
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
exactly the same privacy reason

446
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,839
so we're stuck in the situation where

447
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,079
where if you have like the sort of

448
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,279
accurate information about which sites

449
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,240
are having problems you could just think

450
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,440
about it could you go to the site and

451
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,560
you could like download the script and

452
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,320
find it yourself um uh but um but

453
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,360
doing that would entail collection

454
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,040
browsers are still very problematic um

455
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,240
one thing i would say is people often

456
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,760
say like why don't you just do a scraper

457
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,880
um and you certainly can do that

458
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,279
sometimes um but there are two problems

459
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,720
one is building a scraper that collects

460
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,240
that much information is very expensive

461
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,680
and the second is that it's very easy to

462
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,440
detect when someone has a scraper and if

463
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,760
so especially in these um

464
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,760
in these uh uh fingerprinting cases they

465
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,880
could just send you different different

466
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,800
data there's a lot of fingerprints um so

467
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,480
again the problem statement is to

468
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,720
collect on the sites where the client is

469
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,240
seeing some issue but only to see the

470
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,160
hot ones and only to see and not see

471
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,240
individually um you know what you just

472
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,440
said you're going to but just to pick

473
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,720
the sites that are most problematic in

474
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,839
one way or another

475
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,480
um and i'm just going to preview on the

476
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,839
the rest of the people here were talking

477
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,600
about um a number of use cases i guess i

478
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,199
i hate this first one so i should have

479
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,040
like um remove that my slides got

480
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,600
changed um but there's a bunch of talk i

481
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,519
think other use cases involving but some

482
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,839
advertising work and also some work on

483
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,199
um covenant exposure notification

484
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,680
measurement um so um you'll see those

485
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,040
later but i mean this should give you a

486
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,399
sense of breath the kind of problem we

487
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,160
have here which is all kinds of

488
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,519
sensitive measurements you want to

489
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,560
collect um that uh unfortunately are

490
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,839
difficult to collect with pride over

491
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,440
privacy with like without fancy

492
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,800
technology off the countertop develop

493
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,639
here

494
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,880
um

495
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
so um it's important to recognize there

496
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,560
actually are two kinds of privacy

497
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,519
threats with these kinds of data

498
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,240
collections the first is when you

499
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,920
collect sensitive data and it's directly

500
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,000
tied to identifying information so you

501
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,759
say look i like you know did a survey

502
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,959
and like i called people on the phone

503
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,079
and they told me you know they tell me

504
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,680
this sensitive stuff and now like i have

505
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,519
the phone number and like you know they

506
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,040
told me like you know whether they have

507
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
a particular medical condition um so

508
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,959
that's that's like a direct tie right um

509
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,279
inside um and then there's but there's

510
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,759
also this thing um what's called um uh

511
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,839
basically this goes back to um this high

512
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,839
dimensional data sets is often if you

513
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,000
collect enough non-sensitive information

514
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,759
um and then you collect one piece of

515
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,360
intensive information you can use the

516
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,959
nonsense information to figure out who

517
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,480
the person is and so there's this like

518
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,399
famous observation due to latin sweeney

519
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,799
that like if you just have five zip code

520
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,839
gender and date of birth you can

521
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,439
identify like most population united

522
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,839
states um and

523
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,079
so um generally and there's like was a

524
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,559
bunch of bunch of work also but um by um

525
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,559
uh our vernerian um about this netflix

526
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,760
data set where they're able to find like

527
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,839
people's uh you know who people were by

528
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,760
the netflix netflix browsing history or

529
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,599
viewing history so um we have to solve

530
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,119
both these problems

531
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,240
um so

532
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,679
the naive thing that people often talk

533
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,280
about doing is basically what's called

534
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,200
anonymized data collection and this is

535
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,559
absolutely a viable technique and

536
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,919
there's a bunch of work going on about

537
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,080
it um in ohio working group and the

538
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,080
basic idea is to strip off all the

539
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,280
identifying that information and um

540
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,640
and so what the client does the client

541
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,280
like and it encrypts um the data to the

542
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,880
collector and then you have some proxy

543
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,720
in the middle that removes all the

544
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
metadata like the ip address

545
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,679
um and so this this avoids the collector

546
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,600
like seeing that meta information but

547
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,360
still gets and because that is encrypted

548
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,960
the proxy never sees the report so that

549
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,880
these things are split up um and we've

550
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,480
talked about the trust model for that so

551
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,240
i won't go into that in much detail um

552
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,520
and so the number of ways to do this you

553
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,960
can do this with liquidational proxies

554
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,280
like mask or ipsec or 20

555
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,880
or you can do an application proxy like

556
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,320
oh hi

557
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,240
um so like this is a very good technique

558
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,000
for a number of cases it's really good

559
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,679
for like sort of boosting the privacy of

560
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,960
semi-sensitive data like data you

561
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,240
collect anyway you say well like i wish

562
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,600
it had the ip address you can get rid of

563
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,360
it and so it's very common now for like

564
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,080
browsers to collect telemetry and we

565
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,280
have the ip address which you just throw

566
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,400
away and we agree not to have that

567
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,840
involved um there are also a bunch of

568
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,840
cases where um you want to collect

569
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
individual values um

570
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,440
and these free form data blobs that you

571
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,360
want to really dig into um it's also

572
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,559
like the only way to do things that need

573
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,000
an answer so if you like actually want

574
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
to have not just like data collection

575
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,280
data collection but you also want to

576
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,440
have um data reports like you can't do

577
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,280
that with that you can you'll hide for

578
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,200
that um and the techniques we're talking

579
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,919
about don't do that um

580
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,039
but there's a bunch of cases where it

581
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,120
doesn't work well um

582
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,320
and and the most common cases are um

583
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
you can't it's not good for like these

584
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,919
high dimensionality data sets where you

585
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,039
need to like take multiple values and

586
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,840
put them together and um and the problem

587
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
is that um goes back to what i was

588
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
saying before if you give me like even

589
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,280
the innocuous demographic information i

590
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,640
use identify the person and so if you

591
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,000
give me this data set that conversions

592
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,160
consists of you know of like your zip

593
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,679
code and your birth date and your income

594
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,120
well i can map that back to i know your

595
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,559
income so i can't do it so i can't use

596
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,520
this if i want to do those kind of

597
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,799
correlation because unfortunate

598
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,960
demographic information itself is fine

599
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,320
um

600
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,280
and and the same thing is true if you

601
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,559
want to do like cross tabs inside and

602
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,799
sub groups um it's also not good for

603
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,480
collecting um this kind of heavy hitter

604
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,640
stuff and the reason is because the the

605
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,080
even though it is anonymized you get all

606
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,520
the values even the low cardinality

607
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,799
values and a lot of the cardinality

608
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,559
values are problematic so they might be

609
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,200
for instance you know um you know google

610
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,799
capability or else

611
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,039
um

612
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,600
so the good news is over the past 10

613
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,440
years we've done cryptographic because

614
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,000
of all these problems um and um there's

615
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,679
a bunch of fancy crypto which i'm gonna

616
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,799
really only only vaguely sketch um

617
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,960
but the basic idea is a multi-party

618
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,280
computation so um

619
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,320
you uh the the what the client does is

620
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,720
the client um wants to report some value

621
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,080
and it takes the value and it splits it

622
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,840
up into two two shares with a secret

623
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,240
sharing technique of some kind um and

624
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,520
the way the shares are constructed is

625
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,960
that knowing only one share doesn't give

626
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,400
you any information about the other

627
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,000
about the

628
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,600
and that that splitting is what's called

629
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,960
information theoretically secure maybe

630
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,000
it doesn't depend on computational

631
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,840
assumptions um

632
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,000
um but um when you put the shares

633
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,280
together they of course represent the

634
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,440
entire value so what you do each client

635
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,960
sends like one share to one server

636
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,799
another share another server and then

637
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,960
the servers take the shares themselves

638
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,559
and they aggregate them they compute the

639
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,080
aggregate value but again you're just

640
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,120
working on the partial data so you're

641
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,480
not learning anything and then you could

642
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,000
take the aggregate so like say for

643
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,440
instance you want the sum you've got a

644
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,120
partial sum and then you take each

645
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,480
partial sum and you put them together

646
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,120
and you get the final output and so

647
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,039
the key point here is that you can do

648
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,200
all this work um you know without ever

649
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,880
having anybody see any anybody's

650
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,520
individual value

651
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,000
um so let me just pause for a second

652
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
before i talk at the crypto which is the

653
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,520
trust model um because this is like

654
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,640
really important i know this comes up a

655
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,200
lot we talk about these systems so um

656
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,360
the client's requirement is the two

657
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,600
servers do not collude um if it's a

658
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,200
service clue they can be digital values

659
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,320
and it's game over right um and

660
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,480
um so

661
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,080
um this is very hard to operate between

662
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,679
people obviously and and the client has

663
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,760
to trust exactly one of them um the

664
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,640
client

665
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,840
is great the client trusts both but as

666
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,200
long as one of them doesn't cheat it's

667
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,960
fine and you could do n servers but two

668
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,640
is the most common number obviously the

669
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,480
servers also have to for various reasons

670
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,679
do a little bit of enforcement about

671
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,120
like minimum batch sizes and query

672
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,960
limits and stuff like that to avoid some

673
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,120
attacks that we will talk about here um

674
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,640
for the collector's requirement both

675
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,080
servers have to actually be executed

676
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,679
protocol correctly because either server

677
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,960
can like distort the results that they

678
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,880
don't but again this is only a

679
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,280
correctness requirement um that only one

680
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,400
server is required to behave correctly

681
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,640
from the client's perspective um

682
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
so i just want to recognize right up

683
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,240
front it's like difficult to verify from

684
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,280
the client's perspective that the

685
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,200
servers aren't colliding um that

686
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,240
conclusion could happen through side

687
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,600
channels um

688
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,799
uh depending on the architecture

689
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,799
sometimes the sideshows are small signs

690
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,880
are big you can do point in time audits

691
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,080
to verify that someone is behaving

692
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,520
correctly

693
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,200
but you can't uh but it's like not

694
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,720
possible for them you're not colliding

695
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,480
um and i just want to like so i want to

696
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,400
highlight that um but i also want to say

697
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,760
that like this is like a very very

698
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,600
common scenario on the internet where

699
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,039
you where people have data and you have

700
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,799
to trust and behave correctly i mean if

701
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,919
you think about like you know your data

702
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,840
is in gmail like you know google has

703
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,200
like your entire email record right and

704
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
you're pressing them behave correctly um

705
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,880
and you know even you know even if the

706
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,960
software's running on your machine like

707
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,880
uh you know um generally people think of

708
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,400
that as behaving correctly but like your

709
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,840
ability to verify the software running

710
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,679
on your device extraordinarily limited

711
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,679
and so like

712
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,640
while like it would be great to have a

713
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,600
situation in which you never had to

714
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,720
trust anybody that's simply not the

715
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,320
situation most of us find ourselves in

716
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,559
so we're talking about here is trying to

717
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,480
like alleviate the situation of trust

718
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,360
people and make the number of people

719
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,120
have the trust smaller or the number of

720
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,360
people have to cheat larger i guess um

721
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,559
we're not talking about a limiting trust

722
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,159
entirely it's not possible the state and

723
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,240
our technological development and so

724
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,280
we're trying to improve the situation

725
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,320
but we're not trying to like boil the

726
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,480
ocean

727
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,360
um

728
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,679
so um i want to talk like very briefly

729
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,440
about like one cryptographic protocol to

730
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,880
give you a sense of like the situation

731
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,559
um this is sort of the one that started

732
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,320
it off it's called prio um and it's

733
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,919
useful for computing like numeric

734
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,520
aggregates like sum and mean that kind

735
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,440
of thing and like this is like the one

736
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,200
that's going to most apprehensible um

737
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,559
and like we're going to punt the crypto

738
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,760
to cfrg but this one is like

739
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,000
understandable like normal humans so we

740
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,600
assume each client has some value like

741
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,760
the numeric value and like called x of i

742
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,640
right and so the client does is the

743
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,799
client splits up that value in the

744
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,720
following way it generates a random

745
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,080
value um

746
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,440
sorry about the fancy math but basically

747
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,520
a random value is smaller than a prime

748
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,360
and then it basically does it sends

749
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,600
server one like the value minus the

750
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,919
random value module the prime and it

751
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,080
sends server to the random value it's

752
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,440
like you see it's quite easy to convince

753
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,159
yourself that if you know that oh no the

754
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,480
random value is not enough and knowing

755
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,640
and knowing um that the subtraction is

756
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
not enough and that is sufficient so now

757
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,320
each server takes all the shares i get

758
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,600
from everybody and they add them up

759
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,159
right um and again like because because

760
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,200
because because these are like

761
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,320
information theoretically they're not

762
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,360
only anything

763
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,720
and then they and then they basically

764
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,960
exchange the exchange the sums or really

765
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,720
like one sentence on the other probably

766
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,240
and then if you take the sums and you

767
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,080
add them up um and you like do a bunch

768
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,919
of like much like relatively simple like

769
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,919
you know middle school math you could

770
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,200
just convince yourself because addition

771
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,720
is commutative that when you add the

772
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,840
sums up you actually get some of the

773
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,279
initial values

774
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,080
um so mission accomplished with all this

775
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,440
all this computation zero knowledge and

776
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,240
we have the output at the end

777
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,120
um

778
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,840
so

779
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,279
this is like this seems like really

780
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,159
boring and like kind of obvious um and

781
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,919
but it's actually fantastically powerful

782
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,600
and the reason is because there's a lot

783
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,960
of things you can actually compute with

784
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,880
just the sum thing as long as you encode

785
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,640
the data properly you can compute all

786
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,000
kinds of things as sums so like

787
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,440
arithmetic mean is obvious that sum

788
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,520
divided by count product you compute

789
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,960
product by doing some of the logs

790
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,960
geometric means coming from product you

791
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,080
can do variance and standard deviation

792
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,760
by computing some some of the values of

793
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,279
the squares there's a but there's a

794
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,039
bunch of fancy stuff for doing like or

795
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,880
and min max and even ordinary obviously

796
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,320
squares so the trigger is just finding

797
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,840
the writing coding and there's like

798
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,120
papers now about how to do all this

799
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,880
stuff

800
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,120
um so

801
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,320
one problem that people really say is

802
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,840
like what about bogus data right and

803
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,039
there are actually two kinds of focus

804
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,600
data there's plausible data but it's

805
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,440
actually false so like i'm like about

806
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,120
175 centimeters tall but maybe i save

807
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,360
180 right um this is like a problem with

808
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,559
any surveying technique unless you

809
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,240
qualify yourself and you just live with

810
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,520
it you have to live with the noisy data

811
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,400
right because people don't lie

812
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,240
consistently um and then there's like

813
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,080
consistent completely ridiculous data or

814
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,080
i like say like i'm a kilometer tall or

815
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,679
worse i say like i'm negative kilometer

816
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,320
tall right and ordinarily what you do is

817
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,640
you just like have some filter mechanism

818
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,520
where

819
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,960
you said um you know uh you just said

820
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,279
like well i i i just reject anything

821
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,880
this is a kilometer tall right and but

822
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,320
like with the pre of it is encrypted you

823
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,039
can't do that right and so

824
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,240
um

825
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,039
uh um and so instead what you do is like

826
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,559
and this is the fancy math part each

827
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,840
submission comes with the zero knowledge

828
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,440
proof of validity and the proof says

829
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,880
something like this height report is

830
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,720
like between like 100 and 200

831
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,320
centimeters right the servers work

832
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,000
together to value the proof and you only

833
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,039
aggregate the submissions that have

834
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,880
valid proofs right so like you have to

835
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,640
trust me this part works but like um

836
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,480
this part works um

837
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,840
um but it's important remember that this

838
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,600
part believing this part works does not

839
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,520
we're not necessarily required for

840
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,799
bullying privacy if the privacy claim

841
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,720
caused the previous things um uh the

842
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,840
youtube with zero knowledge please don't

843
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,760
pick the data

844
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,039
um

845
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,200
so okay so like going back to my use

846
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,919
cases right um uh say i want to collect

847
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,360
these user interests right so basically

848
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,720
what you call user interest thing like

849
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
preo is that every user interest is a

850
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,080
bucket and you have like i don't know

851
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,880
100 200 500 buckets right and the client

852
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,240
individually reports time spent in each

853
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,600
bucket you have to report the ones that

854
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,960
are zero too by the way otherwise you

855
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,840
can just look at which buckets are

856
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,679
reported and then you use prior somewhat

857
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,120
and you end up with a bunch of sums one

858
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,200
for each bucket and now you know exactly

859
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,559
how much your time was spent on each

860
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,240
bucket for each bucket but you don't

861
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,640
anybody's individual time spent um and

862
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,240
as i know you can oh you can also

863
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,679
report t squared you could be standard

864
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,600
deviation as well so um this is like a

865
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,559
pretty straightforward application or

866
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,000
something like preamp

867
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
um but there's like a whole pile of use

868
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,919
cases that basically come into this

869
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:14,960
um

870
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,400
okay um

871
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,240
so um

872
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,240
even more fancy is a protocol um called

873
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,000
heavy hitters um well actually they

874
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,120
didn't name it so like we've been

875
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,320
calling it hits um and the idea so the

876
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,000
idea is that like each client submits a

877
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,320
string um like a url and you want to

878
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,880
output the most frequent strings and i'm

879
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,640
gonna like very very aggressively handle

880
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
this but the basic idea is that the

881
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,559
servers can join the compute the number

882
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,799
of strings at any given prefix p and so

883
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,080
what you do is you start with like

884
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,000
basically you just do binary search so

885
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,320
you start with like strings start with

886
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,600
zero and you say how many strings are

887
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,919
zero or start with one and then okay

888
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,520
fine now i'll keep going down the tree

889
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,720
until i've gotten down to whatever

890
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,039
threshold i want to and so you can just

891
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,039
just find all the values and effects

892
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,480
all the important values and basically

893
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,799
log n tries um and i will not even

894
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:01,919
remotely attempt to explain how this

895
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,240
works um i you know i understood it for

896
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,200
about the amount of time i understood

897
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,440
quantum physics when i was in college um

898
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,600
um so but like um again this is like

899
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,360
walnut math at this point

900
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,480
um

901
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,399
so going back to my use cases again this

902
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,440
you can just have to like this for

903
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
conducting broken sites right each

904
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,960
client creates one report for each type

905
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,559
who's broken or which is fingerprinting

906
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,240
and they use his determine on top sites

907
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,840
and it's just and the servers just spit

908
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,360
out the list of all the important sites

909
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,559
but you don't learn who reported them

910
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,760
and you don't know not any sites that

911
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,799
aren't important because the servers

912
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,320
just won't just in the tree once the

913
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,679
cardinality is below a certain value

914
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,360
so um so again this is like an example

915
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,399
how you can use this for like a real

916
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,760
world application like we actually

917
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,520
really care about

918
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,760
um

919
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,840
so

920
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,559
um i i do one thing i want to like flag

921
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,840
is um

922
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,520
that there um is a

923
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,880
there's an issue course called subset

924
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,600
query um which is um

925
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,039
uh that

926
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,799
so submissions could i just giving you

927
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,159
examples or something we're just giving

928
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,679
you submissions that like have one piece

929
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,279
of information but you can also tag the

930
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,720
submissions of the demographic data

931
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,159
because like birthdayers of code results

932
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,600
and these are talking about right and

933
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,000
those get passed on all the way to the

934
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
aggregators right and this is like this

935
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,440
is notionally safe because you say that

936
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,200
the non nonsense information is safe or

937
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
you you only click nonsense information

938
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,279
and then they owed it as encrypted but

939
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,640
then you can say okay computing

940
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,720
aggregate over the subsets um

941
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,080
so that's like a very powerful today

942
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,159
that's one reason why this is like a

943
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,360
powerful technique and ways that like

944
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,399
ohio is not

945
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,320
um but of course it means that repeated

946
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
queries can be used to reduce values by

947
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,760
like querying for the subset like

948
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,520
includes them and then excludes them um

949
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,919
there's defenses against this on having

950
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,240
minimum batch sizes anti-replay um

951
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,919
randomization for differential privacy

952
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,360
um this is a piece of work the working

953
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,399
group's gonna have to work on that's

954
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,919
part of why this is completely done uh

955
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,520
but i think we will understand how to do

956
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,520
pieces of this um for for some some

957
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,720
measurements and then other ones that

958
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,799
you need some more

959
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:51,840
um

960
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,039
so what is the state of the play here um

961
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,799
a number of us some of the people you're

962
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,960
representing have basically developed a

963
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,840
generic protocol um that is designed for

964
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,600
doing privacy pure measurement what i

965
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,919
mean by generic is that

966
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,840
it's a framework protocol that then you

967
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840
can plug in um

968
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,360
uh you know individual cryptographic

969
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,240
technologies um so it's compatible with

970
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,360
the basic what these things called

971
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,039
verifiable should be application

972
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,799
functions which we'll be talking about

973
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,279
um but um initially it's tuned to work

974
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,000
with uh prio and heavy hitters um it's

975
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,520
built on top of https it's going to

976
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,120
smell a lot like you know any rest kind

977
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,480
of protocol like acme or whatever you've

978
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,000
seen before and so it's easy to

979
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,440
implement with physical services

980
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,279
infrastructure and and other people

981
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,200
working on this like um you know having

982
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,880
work from regular infrastructure to

983
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,360
design and work well with this um so the

984
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,679
um

985
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,120
um so let me just give you like system

986
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,320
architecture picture um that's what it

987
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,600
looks like you know there's a bunch of

988
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,120
clients they send their shares and

989
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,200
there's like a leader and and i'm the

990
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,880
leader like basically takes the shares

991
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,559
and parcels about the helpers and

992
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,240
orchestrates the whole computation and

993
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,679
then the data is like sent to a

994
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,039
collector and so the clutch because i

995
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,720
look give me like the output for this

996
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,799
this subset of the system um and then it

997
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,399
splits the results out right and so one

998
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,559
way to think about this um i think

999
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,600
there's a number of different playing

1000
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,200
modes it's compatible with um one of

1001
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,240
which is that you know the collector and

1002
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,159
the leader are the same person and

1003
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,360
they're trying to do it the data

1004
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,799
collection and they outsource the helper

1005
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,559
job to one other person so that they can

1006
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,320
make guarantees about the privacy of the

1007
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
system um another possibility is the

1008
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,960
whole is a whole like leader collector

1009
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,960
helper box is like a service that's

1010
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,120
provided people um

1011
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,960
the trust model here you'd be assuming

1012
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,360
is that the clients have to know what

1013
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,360
the helpers leader are and so the

1014
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,519
clients know who the who who the data is

1015
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,039
being encrypted for and so they can make

1016
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,960
their own assessment of whether or not

1017
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,120
they trust one of those people um though

1018
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,320
of course in a real world scenario

1019
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,399
what's most likely to happen is that the

1020
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,000
clients are deployed by some by the

1021
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,360
collector effectively and the collector

1022
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,519
hardwires the leader and helper and so

1023
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,840
the the user of the servers can inspect

1024
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,519
who those people are but it's not like

1025
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,480
they actually choose them in any

1026
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,000
meaningful way

1027
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,240
um

1028
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,399
so um you know people are actually going

1029
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,080
to ask like what like the situation oh

1030
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,240
hi is um because oh hi as i mentioned is

1031
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,360
useful for many of these kinds of

1032
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,360
settings um these are complements and

1033
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,159
not substitutes so um you know good

1034
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,159
cases for ohi are like as i say sort of

1035
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,760
standing sensitive data this kind of

1036
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,200
rich freeform data that like you

1037
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,960
couldn't really you know aggregate this

1038
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,120
way um um anything of course it needs

1039
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,480
any kind of responsible right because

1040
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,679
like none of this technology gives you a

1041
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,840
response that just measures um good

1042
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,679
cases for ppm are like really sensitive

1043
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:26,960
data um

1044
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,720
hopefully simpler data because like as

1045
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,159
you sort of find any idea it's not like

1046
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,039
really easy to like do really

1047
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,120
complicated stuff um and settings where

1048
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,559
you just kind of do drill down you do

1049
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,480
regression or you do do subset

1050
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,559
correspondence like kinds of things um

1051
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,640
um so like these are like you know these

1052
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,600
are two great hits that tastes great

1053
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,279
together right you can use ohio talk to

1054
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,799
ppm server that's like boosting the

1055
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,640
privacy of the system so like you say

1056
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,080
okay well i do want to collect this data

1057
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,360
but i actually store an ip address so

1058
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,480
you can remove that as well um and

1059
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,559
so um in fact i think you'll see you'll

1060
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,440
see some of the um uh some of that like

1061
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,320
later talks um you can also use um uh

1062
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,640
sort of a front-end proxy server um to

1063
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,440
do a bunch of like um you know kind of

1064
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,600
misuse detection of like you know

1065
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,440
spamming attacks and stuff like that so

1066
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,120
um so i think these are a complimentary

1067
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,720
techniques not but not not competitive

1068
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,760
techniques which is why you see some of

1069
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,840
the same people working on them

1070
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,240
um i don't know why oh yeah right um i

1071
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,679
was like why do i have two more slides

1072
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,600
so i'm now done i think i hit my target

1073
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,440
time target quite well um i have a

1074
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,640
little time for questions which i'd be

1075
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,120
happy to take

1076
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,399
oh i did want to say one more thing um

1077
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,600
but while i'm waiting to see if anybody

1078
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,640
will say anything which is our

1079
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,159
assumption is the vdf functions we

1080
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,039
standardized or are defined in cfrg not

1081
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,880
an itf and so the idea is we'll build

1082
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,279
the framework here and we'll defer the

1083
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,360
work by defining the v dash to cfrg and

1084
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,360
that work is already probably going on

1085
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,240
or is being is being presented as safety

1086
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,480
yes

1087
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,519
boss thanks uh good presentation i

1088
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,440
enjoyed um

1089
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,120
you laid it out really well the one

1090
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,559
thing that i'd like to hear more about

1091
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,240
is sort of the deployment scenario for

1092
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,639
example on slide 14 don't go back you

1093
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,480
you specifically said the client wants

1094
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,440
to report some value right so

1095
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,119
would your expectation be that uh

1096
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,719
application authors and

1097
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,320
and servers would sort of make use of

1098
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,760
the same way that sort of ohio is

1099
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,679
considering being deployed by you know

1100
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,839
various organizations to get into stuff

1101
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,560
or that you know doe is being used for

1102
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,359
if for everything you know dns i mean

1103
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,560
how do you

1104
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,000
where would this be deployed because the

1105
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,239
client actually if if the client is a

1106
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,560
user right they're clueless so yeah

1107
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,399
absolutely yeah i think so i think i

1108
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,079
think the most likely settings for this

1109
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,800
initially will be the kind of like

1110
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,560
um kind of measurements that like people

1111
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,000
are already taking via the software

1112
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,480
disseminate so um you know

1113
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,879
things like browser telemetry um uh you

1114
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,159
know um

1115
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,040
uh i think um the the case of the case

1116
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
of the the um uh tim what we talk about

1117
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,960
next involves um measurement of covert

1118
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,040
exposures um and yeah those things are

1119
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,960
all being done like sort of sort of like

1120
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,160
um you know

1121
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,240
automatically um you know potentially by

1122
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,680
asking these are automatically by the

1123
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,880
software i think there's some

1124
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,880
possibility that in the future um you

1125
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,240
know you'd see like this used for

1126
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,839
surveying for direct surveying where you

1127
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,119
say okay you know are you willing to

1128
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,640
participate in surveys and then we'll

1129
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,480
we'll write down the client and you can

1130
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,200
do it but i mean like you know the the

1131
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,040
uh i mean i think yeah you know these

1132
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,320
are pull these are pull techniques not

1133
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,400
push techniques fundamentally um

1134
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,680
um and i think you know obviously

1135
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,200
cryptographic is so complicated that the

1136
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,400
user has to involve some pieces of

1137
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,040
software to do it

1138
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,160
do you have a use case today that that

1139
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,240
should not be used with ohio that this

1140
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,680
would be a better for that's like

1141
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,440
already in your head for you know i want

1142
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,560
this now

1143
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,800
yeah yeah um so i think so so i think uh

1144
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,960
um the uh cert so certainly the um

1145
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,880
uh the use case of measuring sort of

1146
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,640
misbehaving websites um it basically

1147
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,560
cannot be cannot be contained with ohio

1148
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,880
because you um because you learn the uh

1149
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,240
um

1150
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,000
you learn a bunch of the uh you don't

1151
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,720
want to learn any of the little

1152
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,079
cardinality sites those are very

1153
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,599
dangerous right um because if you like

1154
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,280
collect like every url somebody goes to

1155
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,119
if this is behaving um then there's a

1156
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,400
real probability that you learn a bunch

1157
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,720
of like say google docs um you know

1158
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,040
capability urls or you learn you know

1159
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,960
you know some document quality this is

1160
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,119
like my plan to buy company a you know

1161
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,240
um um so yeah so it's basically like

1162
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,599
anything involves that that kind of like

1163
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,480
string data collection is very

1164
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,800
problematic without high um also even

1165
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,640
like the cert this sort of bucket eyes

1166
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,520
um you know uh um you know give me

1167
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,040
counters that would be 80 80 counters

1168
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,960
like really problematic with the high um

1169
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,400
because basically if you decide to get

1170
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,599
every single value and report it

1171
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,040
separately otherwise you end up a

1172
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,720
situation where you can do these high

1173
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,320
dimensional data sets and use them to do

1174
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,079
to do production so like those are both

1175
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,200
cases where ohio does not perform

1176
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,480
particularly well though the second like

1177
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,000
you could maybe get away with but it's

1178
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,800
probably problematic

1179
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,040
andrew

1180
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,000
just my way of clarity since ohio has

1181
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,320
come up quite a lot uh um in the chat

1182
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,200
with the new presentation um uh where

1183
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,400
you said complimentary there's no

1184
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,079
dependency

1185
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:06,800
on

1186
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,800
yeah

1187
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,399
not at all thank you

1188
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,160
okay chairs i i i'll hang around but

1189
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,160
like i think then we're done right

1190
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,400
yes thank you very much um

1191
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,320
so just for avoidance of confusion the

1192
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,000
the mozilla use cases were bolted into

1193
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,680
accuracy that's correct yes the case i

1194
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,640
mean i didn't cover everything we're

1195
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,160
just doing but those two here's what

1196
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,280
we're doing yes

1197
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,000
right so we're going to roll into uh tim

1198
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,440
now

1199
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,119
if you go ahead and grab the slides

1200
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,240
excellent

1201
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,040
oh

1202
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,200
the song slides

1203
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,880
oh i thought excuse me i thought you

1204
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,400
were going to

1205
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,720
put the slides up

1206
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,040
i can i can run them if you want me to

1207
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,960
or would you i'm not sure how to upload

1208
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,760
them in miner nice and simple anyway

1209
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,960
thank you

1210
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,960
um okay i'll

1211
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,920
dive in and release oh i've got it there

1212
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,000
we go

1213
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,400
all right thank you

1214
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,440
um

1215
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,520
okay so let's get started uh my name is

1216
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,359
tim and i'm an engineer at the internet

1217
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,040
security research group uh we're the

1218
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,720
non-profit that

1219
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,160
operates the let's encrypt certificate

1220
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,359
authority

1221
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,400
um

1222
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
not to be confused with the irs g

1223
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,560
incidentally uh the dilemma that uh mr

1224
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,560
riskorla just introduced in which the

1225
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,920
essential function of gathering

1226
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,599
telemetry from the field introduces

1227
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,839
significant privacy risks for users is

1228
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,160
of great interest to the isrg given our

1229
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,160
mission of reducing barriers to secure

1230
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,520
and private communications on the

1231
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,720
internet

1232
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,560
um next slide please

1233
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,680
so echo covered that you know the ways

1234
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,119
in which telemetry is a privacy risk for

1235
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,040
users and the you know the implied

1236
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,359
benefits to users of um using these new

1237
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,960
technologies but i think it's worth

1238
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,440
noting that uh many data collectors also

1239
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,720
want to do the right thing and respect

1240
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,880
the privacy of their users besides that

1241
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,720
being a decent thing to do the large

1242
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,920
amount of personal identifying

1243
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,760
information stored by conventional

1244
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,520
telemetry systems is a significant

1245
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,599
liability for the data collector

1246
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,280
there's new privacy regulations emerging

1247
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,200
in various jurisdictions all the time

1248
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,040
which require expensive and complicated

1249
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,359
controls around user data

1250
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,200
and all that pii makes for a very very

1251
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,520
tempting target for attackers

1252
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,960
um

1253
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,720
so we have these new tools like prio and

1254
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,800
heavy hitters but uh even those

1255
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,480
organizations with pretty formidable

1256
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,839
engineering departments who have the

1257
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,680
wherewithal to explore these techniques

1258
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,520
are in kind of a jam because you need an

1259
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,599
external trusted partner to execute

1260
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,680
these multi-party protocols

1261
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,800
um so isrg is interested in providing

1262
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,320
private measurement aggregation as a

1263
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,920
public service to the internet for a lot

1264
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,280
of the same reasons that we built let's

1265
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,280
encrypt we want to make it easy to do

1266
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,880
the right thing

1267
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,760
uh next slide please

1268
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,520
so we envision running a standards

1269
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,760
compliant aggregator as a service with

1270
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,079
the same focus on automation and ease of

1271
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,560
integration that drive let's encrypt we

1272
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,119
expect that uh some customers will want

1273
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,640
to run their own aggregator and have it

1274
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,400
work with ours but others will want to

1275
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,480
avoid running any servers at all and

1276
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,680
will instead choose two existing

1277
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,160
aggregators say one run by isrg and one

1278
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,760
run by some other organization or a

1279
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,560
company that chooses to participate

1280
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,839
um

1281
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:14,640
so

1282
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,480
in support of that we are

1283
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,839
hoping to provide an open source

1284
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:21,119
implementation of a ppm aggregator with

1285
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,359
the aim of making it easy for some data

1286
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,680
collector to interoperate with isrges

1287
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,920
aggregator or anybody else's

1288
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,680
so hopefully uh it ends up being a

1289
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,440
matter of grabbing a container image

1290
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,359
from some public registry you deploy it

1291
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,040
into your existing you know kubernetes

1292
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
cluster or whatever you have and you can

1293
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,400
start gathering private telemetry

1294
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,880
cheaply and easily um somewhat akin to

1295
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,119
how the eff cert bot can be easily

1296
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,960
deployed alongside your existing web

1297
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,040
server um to have it manage let's

1298
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,440
encrypt tls certificates

1299
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,800
we are also

1300
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,800
aiming to provide open source client

1301
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,720
libraries targeting like a variety of

1302
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,960
languages and frameworks uh chosen to

1303
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,400
you know facilitate adoption for the

1304
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,319
most likely interested parties so you

1305
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,839
know you can imagine like a swift sdk

1306
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,319
for ios apps uh javascript for web app

1307
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,040
for a single page application on the web

1308
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,200
and so on

1309
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,240
um so right so with this goal in mind an

1310
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,880
open standard through the ietf is

1311
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,119
acutely valuable because a proprietary

1312
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,720
single vendor solution wouldn't be

1313
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,319
terribly useful since the privacy

1314
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,920
guarantees are contingent upon

1315
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,760
independent and non-colluding

1316
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,680
aggregators

1317
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,079
um next slide please

1318
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,200
thank you

1319
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:29,920
so

1320
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,280
we talked a lot about you know the

1321
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,440
benefits of these new technologies but

1322
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,200
uh there are some trade-offs some

1323
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,359
drawbacks to these systems so for one

1324
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,119
thing there are more servers involved so

1325
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,520
it's more likely more likely to fail uh

1326
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,960
somewhat necessarily

1327
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,880
second the verification of the proofs

1328
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,280
that uh introduced earlier

1329
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,880
do introduce some computational network

1330
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,160
overhead and in particular we'll

1331
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,319
introduce depending on which which uh

1332
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,640
protocol which vdaf is in use will

1333
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,480
introduce uh potentially multiple rounds

1334
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,160
of communication between the aggregating

1335
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,440
servers

1336
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,839
uh finally

1337
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,599
um metrics gathered under these schemes

1338
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,480
are

1339
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,680
these skins are necessarily less

1340
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,440
flexible than conventional telemetry

1341
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,680
systems uh you can't make arbitrary

1342
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,680
post-hoc queries sorry you can't make

1343
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,599
arbitrary queries post-hoc against your

1344
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,359
corpus of data

1345
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,280
you have to know up front before you

1346
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,119
begin collecting any data what are the

1347
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,040
aggregations you're interested in

1348
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,720
computing this has to do with the

1349
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,040
construction of the proofs

1350
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,720
as well as enforcing some of the privacy

1351
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,560
guarantees of the system

1352
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,319
um fortunately you know in spite of all

1353
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,760
these challenges we do have some

1354
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,280
evidence that this stuff actually works

1355
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,720
and at scale

1356
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,960
so in december of 2020

1357
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,839
a collaboration between apple google uh

1358
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,839
we at the isrg the linux foundation

1359
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,440
public health initiative the mitre

1360
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,280
corporation and the national cancer

1361
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,960
institute at the national institutes of

1362
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,319
health

1363
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,079
in the united states

1364
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,400
uh launched the exposure notifications

1365
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,400
private analytics system

1366
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,319
and this is the back end to apple and

1367
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,440
google's exposure notifications express

1368
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,119
um which is a system of course for

1369
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,200
covert exposure notifications

1370
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,720
so

1371
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,599
uh

1372
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,520
so en explorer verifications of course

1373
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,520
is the system by which mobile devices

1374
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,520
can sort of anonymously exchange with

1375
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,800
each other to a

1376
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,599
cove exposure enpa allows back

1377
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,440
anonymously and privately back hauling

1378
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,960
that data to your regional public health

1379
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,319
authority so that they can get

1380
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,920
information on how many people are

1381
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,200
getting the notifications how many

1382
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,119
people are on their mobile devices how

1383
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,599
many people are interacting with them uh

1384
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,200
and all sorts of interesting metrics

1385
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,200
about the spread of code itself as well

1386
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,680
as the effectiveness of the

1387
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,280
of the en system

1388
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,359
so this is currently deployed in 13 u.s

1389
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,000
states and the district of columbia and

1390
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,760
at the moment it's gathering 2.1 million

1391
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,839
measurements per hour uh we also heard

1392
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,520
last night if there was one more

1393
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,839
interesting number that uh sometime over

1394
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,720
the night we gathered uh 12 billion

1395
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,920
individual

1396
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,359
metrics that have been aggregated since

1397
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,440
the system launched

1398
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,200
um we're also about to deploy this

1399
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,599
internationally so uh

1400
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,440
beyond the united states so we're hoping

1401
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,160
to soon turn this on in uh four states

1402
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,560
in mexico okay i'm already well over

1403
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,000
time so i will see the floor thank you

1404
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,680
thank you very much tim

1405
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,400
all right martin you're up next do you

1406
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,599
want to run your slides you want me to

1407
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,240
that was kind of broken up

1408
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,440
i

1409
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,560
am sorry

1410
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,119
is that coming through better now or we

1411
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,520
i can hear you now yes thanks

1412
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,839
yeah it takes some time

1413
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:45,720
uh where are we

1414
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,680
i have to thank the people who provided

1415
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,599
the preview on selecting their slides

1416
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:56,800
because all of these slides have the

1417
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,440
same titles

1418
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,760
okay so um i'm going to talk very

1419
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,520
briefly about some of the

1420
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,440
use cases in advertising specifically

1421
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,359
the conversion measurement one

1422
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:08,480
i think charlie's going to follow up

1423
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,079
with some more details

1424
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:10,880
on

1425
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,079
on this one so um conversion measurement

1426
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,800
is something that happens on the web

1427
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,880
quite a bit

1428
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,480
when when someone shows an advertisement

1429
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,640
it's kind of nice to know if that

1430
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,720
advertisement is having the intended

1431
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,760
effect

1432
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,359
and so the goal

1433
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,880
here is to

1434
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,720
measure how many people

1435
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,520
buy the widget when they saw the ad and

1436
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,040
how many by how many people buy the

1437
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,800
widget without seeing the ad how many

1438
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,000
people see the ad without buying the

1439
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,480
widget all those sorts of things

1440
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,760
and

1441
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,839
combinations of of those things for

1442
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:51,359
different uh campaigns and and whatnot

1443
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,359
uh this information flows to both the

1444
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,160
advertisers the ad tech companies and

1445
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,720
those people who who actually sell the

1446
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,440
inventory or put the advertisements on

1447
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,000
their websites

1448
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,520
so

1449
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,520
key question here is is the money i'm

1450
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,960
spending on all this advertising

1451
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,720
actually having an effect

1452
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,160
on me making more money

1453
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,160
so the way this works today is pretty

1454
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,680
simple

1455
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,720
we assign a

1456
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,560
user an identifier so everyone gets

1457
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,040
their own unique identifier and every

1458
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,040
time they visit a website and an

1459
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,720
advertisement is shown or they do

1460
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,200
something then we just create a little

1461
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,720
little log record

1462
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,160
that records all the details from the

1463
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,960
context and the user identifier time

1464
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,200
stamps all those sorts of other things

1465
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,920
and then you look at the log

1466
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,599
and you can answer all sorts of

1467
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,480
questions about what people have done

1468
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,640
it's um it's really great for getting

1469
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,160
the information that you need it's all

1470
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,640
quite precise and leaving aside all of

1471
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,200
the complications of anti-fraud and all

1472
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,720
those sorts of other things you can

1473
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,800
answer all the questions that you have

1474
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,760
fairly precisely

1475
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,960
however

1476
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,160
that

1477
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,800
doesn't really respect people's privacy

1478
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,560
and so the idea behind some of the

1479
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,920
efforts uh

1480
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,200
that we're talking about here is to

1481
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,280
produce aggregate statistics about

1482
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,240
conversions uh without relying on

1483
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,760
user-specific

1484
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,280
logs

1485
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,319
that means you get counts rather than

1486
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:31,279
individual records

1487
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,440
uh the current status of this work is

1488
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,240
that there's lots and lots of

1489
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,640
requirements that are coming through

1490
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,920
this is obviously a lot more complicated

1491
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,000
when it comes into practice there's lots

1492
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,400
of ideas people have all sorts of

1493
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,240
wonderful proposals

1494
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,359
and

1495
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:50,880
some competing requirements but

1496
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,800
a lot of the really promising ideas

1497
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,720
include something like what ekka

1498
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,520
described earlier

1499
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,640
and the simple example here

1500
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,800
is probably the one that is easiest to

1501
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,800
understand you have an event that occurs

1502
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,880
someone views an ad

1503
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,280
you have a

1504
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,440
another event that occurs they buy an

1505
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,079
item as maybe that's connected to that

1506
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,839
particular ad and those are two of

1507
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:21,119
independent events and you can

1508
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,280
imagine those events going into some

1509
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,599
sort of opaque box that's operated by

1510
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,119
say their browser

1511
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,520
or something like that

1512
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,680
and

1513
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,200
you

1514
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,160
add up some numbers and maybe you add up

1515
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,280
a one

1516
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,119
if there was an ad shown

1517
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,839
and the person bought the thing

1518
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,000
and if there was no ad shown you add up

1519
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,160
a zero you get those reports from

1520
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,720
thousands and thousands of people

1521
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,119
and feed them through a system

1522
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,599
like brio or one of those other things

1523
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,520
and you get back a count of the number

1524
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,119
of people who

1525
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,920
saw the ad and bought the product

1526
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,160
and that allows you to make some uh

1527
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,680
conclusions about how you how your

1528
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,880
business has been operating and the

1529
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,280
advertising campaigns you're running

1530
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,720
obviously this gets a lot more

1531
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,119
complicated but uh we'll let charlie

1532
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,400
explain some of that

1533
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,839
any questions on this part

1534
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,240
okay so is that is that the end of your

1535
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,240
presentation

1536
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,240
that is it

1537
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,319
okay let's go ahead and bring uh charlie

1538
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,240
on then charlie do you want me to do

1539
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,400
your slides you do want to run them

1540
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,040
uh i think i can run them let me see

1541
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,000
ask to share slides

1542
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,319
and

1543
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,640
let's see if this works

1544
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,319
great you guys can see it

1545
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,200
yep

1546
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,640
okay great

1547
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,359
hello everyone uh my name is charlie

1548
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,680
harrison i'm a software engineer working

1549
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,880
at google

1550
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,760
uh

1551
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,119
looking at ppm like solutions for doing

1552
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,880
ads measurement on the web

1553
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,000
uh

1554
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,160
to satisfy similar use cases that martin

1555
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,240
was just talking about

1556
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,680
um so i'll kind of breeze through some

1557
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,040
of the background just because there's a

1558
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,359
lot of overlaps with martin's slide but

1559
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,240
i i think the gist here is that

1560
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,839
here at google

1561
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,839
we think third-party cookies are not

1562
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:37,119
great for users uh users privacy

1563
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,000
um

1564
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,200
but

1565
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,440
they're kind of right now like critical

1566
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,400
infrastructure that powers online ads

1567
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,359
um

1568
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:48,000
for exactly the reason martin mentioned

1569
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,520
uh and the

1570
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,040
the problem that we're trying to kind of

1571
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,000
grapple with is whether we can build

1572
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,920
something like a third-party cookie

1573
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,720
alternative that gives users good

1574
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,920
privacy

1575
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,920
while still kind of supporting this like

1576
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,960
critical infrastructure to some extent

1577
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,079
um and i think the key insight here is

1578
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,119
that um at least as it relates to ppm is

1579
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,880
that like many ads use cases are

1580
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,800
actually like totally fine with

1581
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,160
aggregate data

1582
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,000
and they don't actually need to track

1583
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,319
you kind of around the web and learn all

1584
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,559
the data exactly

1585
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,800
um we we could be fine with aggregate

1586
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,119
data in many cases

1587
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,680
uh so i i want to go over just in a

1588
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,839
little bit more detail how attribution

1589
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,440
measurement which is also called

1590
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,520
conversion measurement um

1591
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,319
happens today with cookies essentially

1592
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,000
uh and i'm sure this is going to be

1593
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,720
familiar for many people uh what happens

1594
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,680
is that you typically have an ad tech

1595
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,079
site that is like running on a website

1596
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,880
and that drops cookies on

1597
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,960
uh sets cookies that are readable

1598
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,000
basically from anywhere from any website

1599
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,880
um this allows you basically to keep

1600
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,440
track of like a mega identifier sort of

1601
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,119
which is this third party cookie which

1602
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,800
is uh

1603
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,359
tags the user or the user's device with

1604
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:09,440
an identifier which

1605
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,280
is readable from multiple different

1606
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,160
contexts so you'll read this cookie when

1607
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,640
an ad is placed and you'll also read

1608
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,319
this cookie when there's a conversion

1609
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:20,559
like when you buy something later on

1610
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,559
down the road after you've seen an ad

1611
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:23,520
for it

1612
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,000
and so right now this cookie id is used

1613
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,800
as the join key to join these two cross

1614
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,480
site events right

1615
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,359
um

1616
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,240
and but they they they join arbitrary

1617
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,319
events so like all of your browsing can

1618
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,240
be linked up to this one cookie in

1619
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,440
theory

1620
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,319
uh how could it be improved uh we could

1621
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:45,119
internally join this data in the browser

1622
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,520
um so when you see an ad we could

1623
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,520
register something in like custom new

1624
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,760
browser storage uh and when you buy

1625
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,839
something that was like pointed to by

1626
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:55,040
that ad

1627
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,200
that would join up with that with that

1628
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,520
event in the internal browser storage

1629
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,880
and you could uh have a communication

1630
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,440
path from the browser to something like

1631
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,480
ppm

1632
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,440
where we we you know we have this data

1633
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,960
we want to compute something like a

1634
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,319
histogram

1635
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,559
maybe we want to learn something like

1636
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,040
you know what are the counts

1637
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,440
of conversions like purchases per ad

1638
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,920
campaign so the x-axis is ad campaign

1639
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,920
the y-axis is the number of conversions

1640
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,559
we can we can use ppm to kind of uh

1641
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:29,200
generate data uh data share split that

1642
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,599
encodes that histogram contribution send

1643
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:35,440
that up to ppm and the ad tech could uh

1644
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,920
uh learn aggregate statistics like just

1645
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,119
a histogram

1646
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:44,000
um of of the uh of the counts and this

1647
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,960
doesn't reveal any uh user data directly

1648
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,480
it only reveals aggregates

1649
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,440
um so there are a whole bunch of like

1650
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,160
cool use cases to think about um i know

1651
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,240
there's a lot of talk in the chat about

1652
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,520
um differential privacy and this is a

1653
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,440
something some formal privacy that we

1654
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,760
could add within the ppm system to

1655
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,319
ensure that the output of ppm is private

1656
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:11,839
um so that's something we're looking

1657
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:12,720
into

1658
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,359
um there's a lot of interesting research

1659
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:16,960
that's related to kind of the heavy

1660
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,680
hitter stuff about how do we report

1661
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,440
these histograms when they're like

1662
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,280
really really really big like you are

1663
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,200
running millions of campaigns or you

1664
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,640
want to do like all sorts of different

1665
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,079
crosses

1666
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:31,760
um we're uh really interested in uh

1667
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,319
systems that can help train machine

1668
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:35,920
learning models

1669
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,319
in some cases there's there are results

1670
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,160
that show that even just aggregate

1671
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,079
histograms could be used to train like

1672
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,160
logistic models but like

1673
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,599
are like

1674
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,520
we're looking into more sophisticated

1675
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,880
mechanisms

1676
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,559
um

1677
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,280
there's uh uh you know in rather than

1678
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,960
conversion measurement we could look at

1679
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,880
reach measurement which is asking like

1680
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,359
how many distinct users saw my ad across

1681
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,440
many different websites so this is kind

1682
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,599
of like removing a uh like remove

1683
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:04,839
duplicates

1684
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:09,040
operation um and you know we we're

1685
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,040
we're interested in exploring like you

1686
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,160
know

1687
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,520
we have this conversion measurement

1688
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,200
thing but maybe there's something that's

1689
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,480
more generic

1690
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,119
um that we could use for

1691
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,240
like a more basic browser primitive

1692
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,760
uh

1693
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,160
and i think i think that's my time but

1694
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,440
uh yeah happy to answer questions after

1695
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,160
the uh everyone else is done

1696
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,520
thanks

1697
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,040
very much charlie so now that's the end

1698
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,520
of the uh the use case uh presentations

1699
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,520
so we're going to open the floor briefly

1700
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,520
to anyone who wants to ask about any of

1701
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,559
those

1702
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:45,799
use cases

1703
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,160
okay so i think we're going to go ahead

1704
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,480
and move on to richard now

1705
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,720
thank you

1706
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:13,040
so i sent a request to share slides ah

1707
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,440
there we go yeah

1708
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,760
there we go

1709
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,079
sure

1710
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,200
all right so yeah this is this is pretty

1711
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,440
different so uh ecker talked about

1712
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,000
protocol we had a couple talks about use

1713
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,319
cases um i'm here to talk about kind of

1714
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,960
the substrate

1715
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,520
and the the label we are using for this

1716
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,760
is verifiable distributed aggregation

1717
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,440
functions thanks to chris patton for

1718
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,240
that

1719
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,319
that name

1720
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,880
context here is a like many things in

1721
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,040
the in the ietf we need some complicated

1722
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,640
crypto for this

1723
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,720
and so we're doing some parallel work uh

1724
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:54,880
in cfrg and it goes alongside the crypto

1725
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,040
the protocol work in the ietf

1726
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,079
to kind of uh to specify the the

1727
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:01,920
complicated crypto bits in a place where

1728
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,920
we can get cryptographers eyes on them

1729
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,319
as opposed to just protocol nerds um

1730
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:08,079
just highlighting some some parallels

1731
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,480
here uh tls depending on cryptographic

1732
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,280
primitives that cfrg defines mls relies

1733
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,000
on hpke which you did in cfrg and so for

1734
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,200
this ppm work we're defining this vdf uh

1735
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,720
or

1736
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,079
vdaf depending on how you want to

1737
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:23,119
pronounce it

1738
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:25,440
uh that defining this as the kind of

1739
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,280
cryptographic abstraction

1740
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,640
that um

1741
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,839
that ppm relies on in cfrg

1742
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,839
now if you look at the draft it's kind

1743
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:37,359
of in two parts we define an api

1744
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,520
that is the abstraction ppm is supposed

1745
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,359
to rely on so

1746
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:43,119
the idea is that we have multiple

1747
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:45,920
instantiations that do various flavors

1748
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,960
of this

1749
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,079
private aggregated measurement dance

1750
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,040
that all behave in a close enough way

1751
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,960
that we can define a common api over

1752
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,920
them and build protocol around that api

1753
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,359
and this provides a way you know that we

1754
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:01,280
can build a protocol without having to

1755
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,319
care about the details of the

1756
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,799
cryptography and provides a target that

1757
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,640
cryptographers can look at and design

1758
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,480
new schemes and if they plug into this

1759
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,480
api then they can presumably be used

1760
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,520
inside of ppm with uh you know more

1761
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,359
quickly and more more easily than if

1762
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,200
they'd been um designed kind of

1763
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,839
completely from scratch using a new

1764
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:22,480
not not reusing that construct so what

1765
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,839
i'm going to talk about here is mostly

1766
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,319
the api and i'll talk a little bit about

1767
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:30,079
the instantiations um at the end

1768
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,640
um so is ecker outline uh so just

1769
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,839
briefly to define like what we're

1770
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:36,000
actually doing here

1771
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,720
so the idea of this vdaf is to kind of

1772
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,880
capture the critical things we need the

1773
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,760
cryptography to do inside of ppm

1774
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,240
so kind of working back to front the

1775
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,640
aggregation bit is

1776
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,720
the idea that you know the inputs to

1777
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,720
this process are individual measurements

1778
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,400
and what comes out of it at the end is

1779
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,640
an aggregate measurement over those

1780
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,640
individual measurements

1781
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,240
distributed in the sense that it's

1782
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,760
distributed among a bunch of aggregators

1783
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,200
you know that the computation of that

1784
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,640
aggregate is distributed over those

1785
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,799
aggregators and the privacy properties

1786
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,079
of the individual measurements are

1787
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,240
assured by non-collusion among those

1788
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,680
aggregators

1789
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,920
and finally it's verifiable in the sense

1790
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,160
that the aggregators can check that the

1791
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,680
inputs have

1792
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,240
meet some properties um as ecker pointed

1793
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,079
out you know there's risk in this sort

1794
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,400
of uh distributed scenario

1795
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,240
that the measurement results that get

1796
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,720
reported in by uh the measurement points

1797
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,200
could be corrupt it could be invalid um

1798
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,799
and they that could flow through and

1799
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,119
lead to a garbled aggregate so we will

1800
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,200
have some checks in here um

1801
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,160
that um allow the aggregators to verify

1802
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,520
that the measurements they're getting

1803
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,520
are meet some definition of correctness

1804
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,280
now which exactly which definitions you

1805
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,640
can apply varies a little bit by the

1806
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,960
instantiation

1807
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,359
um so looking at how this kind of plays

1808
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:55,520
out you know this is the kind of classic

1809
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,040
measurement scenario this is how a lot

1810
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,040
of telemetry works today where

1811
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,440
you have a client out there um you know

1812
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,040
actually many clients but i'm only going

1813
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,200
to portray one on this slide you have

1814
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,359
many clients out there collecting uh

1815
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:09,040
measurements of something you know where

1816
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,799
people clicked in an application or what

1817
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:12,799
what not and reporting that back to a

1818
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:16,000
collector and the as you know you've

1819
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,400
seen various takes on this on the last

1820
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,280
few

1821
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,640
but the idea here is that we're

1822
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,880
introducing this aggregator tier in

1823
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,920
between the client and the collector and

1824
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,040
the idea of these

1825
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,960
aggregators is that the client

1826
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,480
shards their each measurement out

1827
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,920
to

1828
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,440
individual shards of the aggregators

1829
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,040
such that you can only make sense of

1830
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,400
that measurement if you have all the

1831
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,359
shares that's how we get that

1832
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,680
non-collusion guarantee

1833
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,119
the aggregators then go through this

1834
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:44,960
process of what i've called prepare the

1835
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,400
term we're using the draft is preparing

1836
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,720
the measurements so that's that includes

1837
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,040
um verifying that the

1838
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,400
measurements are correct are

1839
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,480
acceptable that they're correct

1840
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,119
um and you know transforming them into

1841
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:02,079
an aggregatable encoding perhaps that's

1842
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,079
necessary in some realizations

1843
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,760
um so once you've kind of taken the

1844
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,440
individual measurements and prepared

1845
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,720
them

1846
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,799
you aggregate them um

1847
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:12,319
this is kind of where you do that step

1848
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,480
that um echoers over you add up the

1849
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,359
shares into a share of the sum

1850
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:19,200
and then finally the aggregators send

1851
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,880
their aggregate shares over to the

1852
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,960
collector who unshards them to get the

1853
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,960
final results so this is kind of the

1854
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,200
data flow view of the same thing

1855
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,040
um i think the interesting thing here

1856
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,880
from a kind of protocol point of view is

1857
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,400
you notice there's a kind of back and

1858
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,720
forth thing at the preparation stage

1859
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,359
there is a need for some some chattiness

1860
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:39,200
some interaction between the aggregators

1861
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,000
in that verification process to enable

1862
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,200
um

1863
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,960
a distributed verification of the

1864
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,359
correctness of the input shares

1865
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:49,520
um but otherwise hopefully this kind of

1866
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:53,040
explains the overall process also this

1867
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,359
um the kind of little gray squares that

1868
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:57,039
uh parallel to the output shares are

1869
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:58,880
other and meant to indicate other output

1870
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,280
shares the idea that an aggregate share

1871
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,760
represents the aggregation

1872
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,559
of

1873
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,640
the output shares over a batch of

1874
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,960
measurements and as as was pointed out

1875
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,480
before it's up to the aggregators to do

1876
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,160
things like enforce minimum batch sizes

1877
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,960
define what a batch is

1878
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,440
so that's kind of the data flow

1879
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,039
um

1880
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,039
this is how kind of how we've described

1881
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,200
that api in the draft um

1882
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,599
again just kind of using notations here

1883
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:26,720
um

1884
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,280
so basically you know what the

1885
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,119
vdaf draft defines is this api and how a

1886
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:35,119
couple of instantiations fulfill that

1887
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:36,160
api

1888
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,319
and then ppm's job is to do the plumbing

1889
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,880
to get the inputs and outputs of of

1890
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,079
these uh

1891
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:43,039
local

1892
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:44,079
functions

1893
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:45,839
to the right places at the right time so

1894
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:47,440
that at the end of the day

1895
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,359
you can unshard into a measurement

1896
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:52,720
that's meaningful to the collector

1897
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:55,920
in the draft we define a couple of

1898
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,920
constructions i think ecker probably

1899
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,200
described

1900
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,480
described these in a little bit more

1901
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,760
detail um

1902
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,880
prio is is the one where we that i think

1903
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,760
uh enpa is is based on uh the diversion

1904
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,319
in the draft is is i think

1905
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,920
has a few more changes on top of what's

1906
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,000
in the enpa but that's one where we have

1907
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,920
a fair bit of deployment experience and

1908
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,200
then the hits protocol is the one that

1909
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,119
lets you get a distribution on strings

1910
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:20,480
and there's been some discussion in chat

1911
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,079
about whether you know possibly we could

1912
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,920
fit something like star in here um

1913
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,599
that's i mean it's kind of the idea of

1914
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:27,839
the draft is that we can look at

1915
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,319
not just these two but also fitting

1916
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:32,079
other things in under this umbrella so

1917
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:33,920
that we can have ppm as a generic

1918
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,680
construct into which we can fit multiple

1919
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,279
different cryptographic realizations

1920
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,480
there's a few implementations so far um

1921
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,799
this is kind of uh well we have the one

1922
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:49,920
that supports enpa uh with prio v2 we've

1923
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,960
got some early implementations of uh

1924
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,319
distributed point functions are what

1925
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,079
supports uh kind of the inner loop of

1926
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:59,280
hits um and there's some work uh on

1927
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,559
various previous

1928
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:02,000
instantiations

1929
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,920
um i think one of the things interesting

1930
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,119
that comes out of this is that we can

1931
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,200
start to do some measurements of the um

1932
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,280
the cost of doing these algorithms um if

1933
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,119
you look at the papers in which they're

1934
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:13,039
published there's you know it might look

1935
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:14,319
intimidating in terms of the amount of

1936
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:15,440
data that's getting sent around the

1937
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,200
amount of computations being done but

1938
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,799
with these implementations we have some

1939
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:21,920
early data about the expense of

1940
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,359
in terms of computation and

1941
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,280
communications overhead

1942
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,520
of uh doing these private schemes and

1943
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,200
you know

1944
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,440
your mileage may vary but it seems seems

1945
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:35,200
tolerable to first order let's say that

1946
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:40,079
um so yeah i think that's all i had

1947
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:43,200
yeah a couple references

1948
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:46,319
much that puts us uh right on schedule

1949
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:47,359
again

1950
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,240
uh much appreciated so any any questions

1951
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:54,839
for richard about any of that

1952
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,640
eric

1953
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,680
hey

1954
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,559
um so in one of your slides you had the

1955
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:10,799
aggregators with lines

1956
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:14,240
between them and in the

1957
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:17,520
um ppm spec i mostly see sort of the

1958
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,599
helpers not connected

1959
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:22,079
are we thinking about a protocol where

1960
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:23,920
we might imagine

1961
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,079
enabling a topology that

1962
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,319
could have helpers sort of communicating

1963
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:31,520
with each other um like some npc

1964
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:35,520
protocols uh allow for yeah this slide

1965
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,240
yeah i i i i admit that i'm not an

1966
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,240
expert on kind of what the ppm protocol

1967
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,680
is doing right now i've mainly been

1968
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,280
stuck down at this layer but i think my

1969
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,240
understanding is that you can emulate

1970
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,440
you know this kind of looks like a

1971
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,200
broadcast channel and if you have a

1972
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,640
leader that

1973
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,799
um is connected to multiple helpers you

1974
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:54,960
could have basically a star topology

1975
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,480
that over which you can emulate a

1976
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,640
broadcast channel so if if a helper

1977
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,559
needs to it

1978
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,200
for us for instance in the in the um

1979
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,000
in the pro in the api we've sketched out

1980
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,359
uh

1981
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:09,280
we structure the preparation process in

1982
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,559
rounds where the input to each round is

1983
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:15,200
uh the output of the previous run from

1984
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,799
all uh aggregators so i think in the ppm

1985
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:19,760
uh

1986
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,599
content kind of communications model you

1987
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:24,000
can envision all helpers submitting

1988
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,680
their outputs from the previous round

1989
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,920
and then the leader distributing those

1990
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,839
outputs out to all of the helpers for

1991
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:31,680
the next round

1992
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,078
kind of yeah

1993
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,160
just add on to that yeah i think

1994
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,920
basically the assumption is that the

1995
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,280
communication is probably mediated by

1996
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,039
the leader um but that that's the

1997
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,799
assumption it is embedded in ppm not

1998
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,960
embedded here and certainly that turned

1999
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,799
out to be not a workable function so

2000
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:48,799
figure something out

2001
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:50,640
yeah i mean i think it might be useful

2002
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,280
for the leader to be able to

2003
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,319
you know

2004
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:56,559
coordinate helpers directly connecting

2005
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,319
to each other just to minimize

2006
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:00,960
communication overhead but

2007
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,880
as long as that's sort of within scope

2008
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,359
or or whatnot absolutely considering i'm

2009
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:06,160
fine

2010
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,680
yeah we have a this is this is like a

2011
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,240
straw man thing um it's not uh like a

2012
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,520
first of all any change radically i

2013
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,119
imagine

2014
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:15,839
thank you

2015
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,079
chris patton i saw you briefly flash up

2016
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:23,520
in the speaker list your geocomment

2017
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:28,279
so i don't need to reiterate it

2018
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,200
okay

2019
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,640
seeing no one else in the queue thank

2020
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,799
you again uh very much richard

2021
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:40,720
we're going to go ahead and move on to

2022
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,280
um well first we're going to call and

2023
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,240
bring the slides up here

2024
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,079
so we're going to move on to a call for

2025
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:58,000
expression of interest from folks in

2026
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,200
this um

2027
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,559
just just to make sure that there is

2028
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,480
enough critical mass behind this aside

2029
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,640
from the people who have presented here

2030
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,680
uh we'd like to ask who in attendance is

2031
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,680
interested in working on this technology

2032
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,039
trying to figure out we probably don't

2033
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:14,880
need people to speak to this necessarily

2034
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,799
although we're very happy to hear what

2035
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:18,960
you have to say on the topic

2036
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,759
i'm also going to throw up a

2037
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:25,839
quick show of hands

2038
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:37,639
there we go

2039
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:46,399
so go ahead tommy

2040
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:53,759
hello all right um i i did the show

2041
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:55,040
i just wanted to speak up a little bit

2042
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,439
to mention

2043
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,839
from my perspective you know uh

2044
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:01,920
we definitely have

2045
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:02,880
already

2046
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,238
using stuff like this and seeing

2047
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:06,479
something like this be standardized and

2048
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:07,839
taken on by the word group would be

2049
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:09,600
something that would be a positive thing

2050
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,560
so

2051
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,640
uh we didn't do any of the presentations

2052
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:13,839
here but

2053
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:16,640
we're definitely interested

2054
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,799
thank you

2055
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:30,799
does anyone else want to stand up and

2056
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:34,839
speak specifically to it

2057
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:39,120
that we did get um uh is two things one

2058
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,359
that uh uh i think everybody who is beak

2059
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:42,560
is interested in working on this just so

2060
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,439
we're all clear and second um uh uh if

2061
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:46,880
you look at the um there's a bunch of

2062
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:47,839
people in the job or chat that are

2063
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:49,839
saying nurses including facebook and

2064
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:51,520
whatever tuesday

2065
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,520
oh excellent thank you

2066
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,880
all right uh robin

2067
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:00,320
is the audio okay

2068
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,679
yes

2069
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:04,400
great thanks adam um yeah this is uh so

2070
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,920
this is a personal comment rather than

2071
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,080
anything on ice behalf

2072
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,480
uh i would be interested in um at least

2073
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,560
following the work and

2074
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,880
um i would also have a personal interest

2075
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,600
in seeing to what extent it can be used

2076
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,880
to test the the um

2077
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,960
growing and increasing the mature body

2078
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,159
of work on

2079
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:26,560
um what's sometimes called values value

2080
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,080
based design

2081
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,800
so in in other words um what systematic

2082
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,679
approach can you um adopt

2083
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:37,199
for the design and innovation process

2084
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,920
that ensures that ethical factors and

2085
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,840
values are considered at each relevant

2086
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,480
step

2087
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,800
and i think that would

2088
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,719
that would help clarify a lot of the

2089
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:51,199
comments in the chat

2090
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:52,159
about

2091
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,400
along the lines of yes but this happens

2092
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,560
already or

2093
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,719
well this only works if you can assume

2094
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:01,760
there's no collusion and so on

2095
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,920
because what it does is it flushes those

2096
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,159
assumptions out

2097
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:07,920
and lets you determine whether you want

2098
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,960
to design in a way that is compatible

2099
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,120
with those behaviors or actually perhaps

2100
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,960
even conceivably

2101
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,679
inhibits those behaviors

2102
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,560
okay thanks

2103
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,199
uh yari

2104
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,880
yeah i just wanted to briefly mention

2105
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,840
that

2106
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,360
i do think this is

2107
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,199
exciting technology and we should work

2108
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:38,159
on that

2109
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:39,840
i can see

2110
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,520
other types of applications we mostly

2111
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,199
talked about the

2112
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:45,440
uh sort of application type uh browser

2113
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:48,480
type of things but also many types of

2114
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,360
networks we could probably use this this

2115
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,040
technology to

2116
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,840
do a better job at uh collecting

2117
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,679
information that means we collected for

2118
01:11:57,679 --> 01:11:59,280
various uh

2119
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,199
debugging and uh other other reasons

2120
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:04,800
the only piece that i was sort of a

2121
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,199
little bit concerned about was was this

2122
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,679
advertising piece and i sort of just uh

2123
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:11,199
as a personal opinion i had some

2124
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:13,040
reservations about

2125
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,600
browsers working with advertisers

2126
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,280
even though i do recognize that i need

2127
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,040
to do something better than we do today

2128
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,480
but

2129
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,400
you know maybe there's also other paths

2130
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,239
for the advertisement problems trying to

2131
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:26,400
try to prevent information flow rather

2132
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,360
than

2133
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,760
collaboration but uh i don't work for

2134
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,920
the advertisement in the industry so

2135
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,679
anyway i i like this they should go

2136
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:36,000
ahead

2137
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,440
you

2138
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,759
wendy

2139
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:53,520
so i i we can't hear you unfortunately

2140
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,640
there may be um

2141
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,640
an incorrect input device selected or

2142
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:04,280
something along those lines

2143
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:17,199
okay um i think we probably need to let

2144
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:19,760
you try to work that out and

2145
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,320
get back in the queue

2146
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,400
thanks

2147
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,960
uh ted

2148
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:33,360
uh thanks uh i basically got in the

2149
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,840
queue to to to answer one of the bob

2150
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,000
questions that's do i think the problem

2151
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,679
statement is clear well-scoped solvable

2152
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:41,920
and useful to solve and i think one of

2153
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,080
the things that kind of worries me about

2154
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,880
the way it was presented today is that

2155
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,199
it's talking about what seems to me to

2156
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,360
be a set of problems

2157
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,840
and aggregating them into something

2158
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,480
which seems to be arguing that a single

2159
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,280
solution is the best solution

2160
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,760
for each of the ones in this set

2161
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,520
and i would be very interested in seeing

2162
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,520
the work go forward but i would suggest

2163
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,520
that in scoping the work that you do it

2164
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,600
in a way that allows you to say

2165
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,320
the best answer for this

2166
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,719
member of that set may be different from

2167
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:16,719
the best answer for that member of the

2168
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:20,000
set uh in particular the the set of

2169
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,840
problems you're dealing with with

2170
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,360
something like identifying bad urls etc

2171
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,000
um doesn't really involve tying two

2172
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,840
actions together in the same way that an

2173
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,080
ad conversion does so it may be that

2174
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,960
there are simpler um mechanisms or only

2175
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,280
a partial use of this system that would

2176
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,120
still satisfy those

2177
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:42,159
where invoking the full thing might be

2178
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:44,640
more difficult and not necessarily

2179
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,159
buying you everything

2180
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:48,239
uh that it would need to buy you when

2181
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:50,320
when you had the conversion case

2182
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,960
so i think as a set of problems it's

2183
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,960
interesting to work on but i would

2184
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,520
prefer that we take it as a set

2185
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,960
uh when we take the work in

2186
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:02,960
thank you ted

2187
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,159
uh

2188
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:06,320
phillip

2189
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,360
yeah i

2190
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,840
i like this

2191
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,360
stuff uh i don't think that we

2192
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,199
understand the problem but i want to do

2193
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:15,120
it anyway

2194
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,880
um

2195
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,560
i am a bit worried that we seem to have

2196
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,040
gone straight for the

2197
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:24,480
real high falutin cryptography

2198
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,120
rather than measures like let's just

2199
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,440
encrypt log files

2200
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,600
as they're produced

2201
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,120
rather than having them sit in plain

2202
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,040
text ready to be stolen

2203
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,640
so there's a bunch of real bread and

2204
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,520
butter issues i think that we need to do

2205
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,760
as ietf

2206
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,360
before we do the stuff that really

2207
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,800
excites us

2208
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,840
the other thing that i point to is this

2209
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,560
has been presented in terms of a network

2210
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,640
realization

2211
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,440
i think that the more immediate and more

2212
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,239
useful use for this would be to assist

2213
01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:00,480
work like the stuff that my wife does

2214
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:01,760
analyzing

2215
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,480
workers compensation claims

2216
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,199
in that there you've got enormous amount

2217
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:08,400
of

2218
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:11,040
really privacy sensitive data

2219
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:14,239
that is aggregated together and then she

2220
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:16,640
analyzes it

2221
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,080
and so it that's not a network uh

2222
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,920
application but that transition from i

2223
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,960
have this large amount of data

2224
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,280
i would like to pre-process it into a

2225
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,080
form that it can't then leak

2226
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,400
in a dangerous way and analyze it in

2227
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,600
that form

2228
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,560
i think that that technology

2229
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,280
would be very useful

2230
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,719
disconnected from the whole network case

2231
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:46,840
and it might make for

2232
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,880
some uh

2233
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,640
starting problems

2234
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,280
that are rather simpler than trying to

2235
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:57,679
think about how do we secure the web

2236
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,719
right thank you

2237
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:05,520
um chris

2238
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,840
so there we go

2239
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,280
so

2240
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,040
chris oh chris appears to have

2241
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,600
disappeared he's showing us offline

2242
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,400
let's move on to wes

2243
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,480
thanks so

2244
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,960
you know in general i think this is a

2245
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,480
an interesting problem to look at and

2246
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,480
it's certainly something that we could

2247
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:49,280
consider doing it's uh as ted said it it

2248
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,600
meets all of the buff criteria

2249
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,520
except for you know one oddity right

2250
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,760
that that this solution is really

2251
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,120
designed to help us protect ourselves or

2252
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,440
protect end users

2253
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:04,640
from good people right because it it has

2254
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:07,120
no ability to prevent all of the evil

2255
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,440
sites and the the evil of you know

2256
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,920
mechanisms and evil ad trackers that

2257
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,480
don't want to use aggregation because

2258
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,480
they're act deliberately trying to track

2259
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,080
individual people

2260
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,640
and you know i i think it would be sort

2261
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,640
of fair to say that this cool new

2262
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,400
technology really helps you perfect

2263
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,159
protect you from companies that may

2264
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:27,760
already be behaving reasonably in the

2265
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,040
first place

2266
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:29,920
and

2267
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,280
that doesn't mean that it's not worth

2268
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,360
doing but you know there's a security

2269
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,719
consideration sections i'd be

2270
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:38,600
considering writing

2271
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,000
looks like chris is connected against

2272
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,560
let's go ahead and take him next thanks

2273
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:51,280
yeah sorry about that um i i just wanted

2274
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,640
to echo something that richard was

2275
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,400
saying in the chat um

2276
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,360
uh and and perhaps uh ask us to take a

2277
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,360
step back from the advertising use cases

2278
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,400
um

2279
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,719
and recognize that uh this this pattern

2280
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:04,080
that we're seeing across the industry

2281
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,080
across different problem domains uh for

2282
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,400
collecting these aggregates be it in you

2283
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,880
know telemetry for browsers or exposure

2284
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,920
notification for coven or even you know

2285
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,360
bandwidth measurements in the case of

2286
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,159
tor

2287
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:18,719
is very very common um

2288
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:21,280
and i think it's certainly true that we

2289
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:24,640
have uh confidence in um

2290
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,320
the general shape of the problem that is

2291
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:29,040
to say we we want to we have we need to

2292
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,040
collect these aggregate statistics to

2293
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,600
answer certain questions um

2294
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,719
and it's uh

2295
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:38,239
whether or not you know this is harmful

2296
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,000
helpful for the purposes of uh web

2297
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,280
advertisements and conversion

2298
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,800
measurements in a privacy provisional

2299
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:43,600
way

2300
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,239
um i think is a good question to ask um

2301
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:48,080
but that does not i don't think that

2302
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,440
takes away from

2303
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,360
the the very valid use cases that were

2304
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:54,159
also presented here

2305
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:55,120
that

2306
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,840
could certainly be improved by a more

2307
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,159
privacy preserving protocol so

2308
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:02,480
um i i'm

2309
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,719
very strongly supportive of this work um

2310
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:06,639
it cuts across so many different problem

2311
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:08,880
domains and use cases and

2312
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,159
um it's kind of inevitable um that you

2313
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:13,679
know it'd be standardized somewhere

2314
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:16,400
given how important it is so

2315
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,239
that's what i want to say thank you

2316
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:19,360
thanks

2317
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,960
um so we've we've closed the queue in

2318
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,239
the interest of making certain we have

2319
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:23,600
enough time to discuss the proposed

2320
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,159
charter uh although uh

2321
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:29,440
let's go ahead and move on decker here

2322
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,520
yeah so i would make a number of points

2323
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,239
um so so first i think um you know uh

2324
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:36,000
ted's point um yeah i mean this is a

2325
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
toolbox um that's got that it has a

2326
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,159
variety of tools and i think that that

2327
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:41,520
you know that the one way to think about

2328
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,120
this is that the ppm protocol is the

2329
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,960
toolbox and the vdf's the tools um and

2330
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,560
so the idea is not it's not not to

2331
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,480
define any particular um you know

2332
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:51,280
measurement measurement um you know

2333
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,679
thing is to define is to define a set of

2334
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:54,800
mechanisms which can be used for taking

2335
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,080
different kinds of measurement and then

2336
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,360
you know individual applications they

2337
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,280
layer on top of those tools um so that

2338
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,440
would be true both in terms of the you

2339
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,760
know which vdas exist and it'll also be

2340
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,400
true in terms of like how um how you

2341
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,760
build applications on top of the top of

2342
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,199
the vdf because like you know like i

2343
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:10,400
mean one thing about this is like you

2344
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,760
got a thing that basically says i can

2345
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,239
collect counts right and but like what

2346
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:15,360
do you do with those counts is an

2347
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,880
important question um and one that we

2348
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,600
don't pretend to define um

2349
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,960
the um

2350
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:21,840
you know

2351
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,520
it's uh um

2352
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,679
uh i i i do see some over indexing on

2353
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:27,679
the on the ad use case here as well um

2354
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:28,400
you know

2355
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,400
uh um you know there are a lot of these

2356
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,480
cases they're not ads um and in

2357
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,760
particular like there's nothing ad

2358
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,840
specific to any of this um all the ad

2359
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,000
specific work that's which exists or

2360
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,880
somewhere else in pat cg um so i mean

2361
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:41,920
this is about building a set of

2362
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,840
fulfillment measurements um and and as a

2363
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,120
really one application measurement with

2364
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,120
that said i do think that um you know

2365
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,040
this question about like you know um

2366
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,800
about this is for letting good people do

2367
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,159
do good things i think there's two

2368
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:54,000
points about that one is that there are

2369
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,239
a lot of applications where i as wes

2370
01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:57,199
says good people want to take

2371
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:59,760
measurements and want to be able to like

2372
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,440
bind themselves so they can't cheat you

2373
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,800
um and so it can't be collected the day

2374
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,080
they don't want to have so that's

2375
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,840
application case one i think application

2376
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,560
case two is um that there's been a lot

2377
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,719
of like attempts to look at what it

2378
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:12,639
would take to like you know reproduce

2379
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:14,080
partially out ecosystem with better

2380
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,760
privacy because like i think we'll agree

2381
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,360
as they're not going to go anytime soon

2382
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,440
and one of the pushbacks that one gets

2383
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,360
once once it's doing that is it will

2384
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,679
have a negative impact on the ecosystem

2385
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:26,719
as a whole and like you know i'm not um

2386
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:28,400
you know um i think

2387
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:29,679
you know firefox has already played a

2388
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:30,960
bunch of anti-tracking technologies so

2389
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,320
like i'm not like all in on that but i

2390
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,520
think there's a real concern people have

2391
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,440
and so the idea is not that when we

2392
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,280
simply offer you know these alternative

2393
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,440
technologies and then people would use

2394
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,040
them and third-party cookies the idea is

2395
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,400
that the idea is that zulu offers

2396
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,719
alternative and that would eventually

2397
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:46,480
have to deprecate the existing

2398
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:49,759
privacy-based technologies

2399
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:50,960
right

2400
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,880
thanks ecker um

2401
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,280
charlie

2402
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,560
yeah i also wanted to uh respond to wes

2403
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,000
and some of the comments in the chat

2404
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
just mostly the plus one what ecker said

2405
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,360
but yeah i'm

2406
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,199
uh on the on the google end we're

2407
01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:07,040
definitely looking at

2408
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,960
uh

2409
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:09,840
like

2410
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,840
helping helping this this

2411
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,480
uh tracking problem on the web with kind

2412
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:18,080
of a two-pronged approach like one is

2413
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,920
having a well-lit path where we can

2414
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,080
recover use cases in a way that we know

2415
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:25,040
is is privacy preserving uh something

2416
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,760
like ppm could fit into this story

2417
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,520
and once we have kind of a uh

2418
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:32,239
a

2419
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:34,480
foundation where some of the use cases

2420
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,400
that we think are are important to

2421
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,040
maintain the ecosystem are there

2422
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:42,960
then we can go ahead and uh remove kind

2423
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,480
of the bad stuff

2424
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,880
that we think is bad for user privacy so

2425
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,560
this question of like oh only the good

2426
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,920
guys will do it and the bad guys will

2427
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,840
use this other stuff like here i think

2428
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,719
the platform can really mediate this and

2429
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:56,560
if we think that the platform provides a

2430
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,120
good enough foundation then we can we

2431
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,840
can remove the stuff that we think is is

2432
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,760
bad for user privacy and this is like

2433
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,480
our our strategy that we're trying to do

2434
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,960
uh on chrome where you know we're

2435
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,639
investing all this time trying to come

2436
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:13,760
up with new browser primitives um and

2437
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:16,080
also we have like a timeline where we

2438
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,120
want to

2439
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,840
uh disable third-party cookies um and

2440
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,360
deprecate them uh so yeah we're we're

2441
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,199
i i think i think this is like a

2442
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:27,520
reasonable point but it's you know it's

2443
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,360
something that we're we're we're looking

2444
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:32,960
into as like a long-term strategy

2445
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:35,600
thank you very much charlie um i do want

2446
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,840
to give wendy an opportunity to to come

2447
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,520
back in if we think we've

2448
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:43,880
solved the audio issues um

2449
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:48,480
all right

2450
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:00,320
okay um so let's go ahead and move on to

2451
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,800
the charter then

2452
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,560
i have it uh

2453
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,080
up here in front of us we've broken into

2454
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,280
two sections

2455
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,400
um

2456
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,159
it's probably not terribly useful for me

2457
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:11,760
to try to read through it directly as

2458
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,520
it's on your screens

2459
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:14,800
but we want to go ahead and take some

2460
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,400
comments here i see our area director

2461
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:17,520
has stepped up

2462
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,480
sorted out and told us to move on

2463
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,800
i'm i'm sorry we missed the first part

2464
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,480
of what you said there roman

2465
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,360
ah

2466
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,520
wendy said that she is not going to be

2467
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,440
able to get her audio working and told

2468
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,440
us to move on but she appreciates the

2469
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,120
opportunity for the slot

2470
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,800
all right thank you

2471
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,000
um

2472
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,400
so uh this is the current proposed

2473
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:42,080
charter or at least the first half of it

2474
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,679
i want to go ahead and open the floor to

2475
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:46,000
comments on the formulation that we have

2476
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
here

2477
01:25:57,679 --> 01:25:59,120
and recognizing that people are still

2478
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,480
reading i'm going to give it a bit of

2479
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:03,480
time

2480
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,239
okay i'm going to go ahead and skip on

2481
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:53,440
to the second half of the charter

2482
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,799
which is where a lot of the media's

2483
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:59,920
specifically the second paragraph talks

2484
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,120
about exactly what the working group

2485
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:04,360
will be doing

2486
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,959
florence

2487
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:15,520
um thank you um so thanks for all the

2488
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:16,560
presentations it's been really

2489
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:19,120
interesting um so most presentations

2490
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,280
today were about use cases

2491
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,679
um but there's nothing about that in the

2492
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:26,080
charter i don't think although i can

2493
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,159
only see the second side now

2494
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:31,440
or i don't think currently in the draft

2495
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:33,679
i think that would be a useful thing to

2496
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:37,360
kind of document somewhere um

2497
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:41,120
all right thanks ecker

2498
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:42,960
i think we're up for that i guess um you

2499
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,000
know i think

2500
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,040
one thing we're trying to do is with the

2501
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,719
use cases motivational um because i

2502
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:47,840
think like the these are generic

2503
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:48,960
techniques but i think it'd be great i

2504
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,000
think i would be more than happy to

2505
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,760
think to like write down like what like

2506
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,360
enough motivation is to understand why

2507
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:54,880
you want to collect the naked statistic

2508
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,880
and just to say something um siobhan

2509
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,159
should ask in the chat is there's room

2510
01:27:58,159 --> 01:28:00,880
for like for like multiple um for like

2511
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,639
for like multiple instantiations of the

2512
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:04,320
same basic task i think absolutely so i

2513
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,440
think for instance if there's a there's

2514
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,120
a better mechanism for for collecting

2515
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:08,639
heavy hitters than hits which is

2516
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:09,840
relatively expensive that would like

2517
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,560
something like that room for um i think

2518
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:15,280
you know um you know uh uh

2519
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,199
like i'd certainly be interested like

2520
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:18,880
like i think i want to build something

2521
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,239
where like as new cryptography gets

2522
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:21,679
adults we can add it and i'm gonna build

2523
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:23,600
something where we have multiple

2524
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,040
mechanisms that like support the same

2525
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,280
basic thing um i think you know the only

2526
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,199
the only question i i i want to be sure

2527
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:30,320
is like you know if we have something

2528
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,679
radically different in some like some

2529
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:32,800
lightweight it doesn't match up then we

2530
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:33,920
have to ask would be better to make a

2531
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,760
new a new protocol or better to fit it

2532
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,760
in but like i'm i'm like definitely pro

2533
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:40,800
fitting they do things

2534
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:42,400
thanks

2535
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,719
siobhan

2536
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,880
yeah i just wanted to see that um

2537
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:51,280
that's that's encouraging i just want to

2538
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,880
make sure that like currently the

2539
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,800
charter i think would kind of rule out

2540
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,679
some of the ideas um alternatives to

2541
01:28:57,679 --> 01:28:59,679
achieve the same goals so i think the

2542
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:03,440
charter would need some tweaking

2543
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:11,080
just specifically which aspect of it

2544
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,960
um i think if you go to the previous one

2545
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,280
previously sorry

2546
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,040
um i think

2547
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:21,040
like splitting measurements between

2548
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,480
multiple non-including servers like i

2549
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:23,280
think

2550
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,480
um

2551
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,800
that is like a class of

2552
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:27,520
for

2553
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,600
techniques for

2554
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,440
achieving this goal of privacy

2555
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,960
preserving measurements but i think you

2556
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:36,239
could do it in other ways as well

2557
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,239
and i see there's some support to

2558
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:42,080
rewrite text and i'm happy to send a pr

2559
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,080
thank you for the clarification

2560
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:47,360
okay um jim

2561
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:51,760
i think the charter needs to say

2562
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:54,320
something about use cases and threat

2563
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,400
models i don't have any formal words for

2564
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,080
that at this point

2565
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,520
but i do think that's the important

2566
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,920
thing to capture here because

2567
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:03,760
if we're going to be developing multiple

2568
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,840
solutions as ted was alluding to edward

2569
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,199
there might be different threat models

2570
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:08,800
that apply to them rather than a single

2571
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,639
overarching one and i think it would be

2572
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:12,000
good to make sure that information is

2573
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,440
clearly captured when things are

2574
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,600
developed and obviously that needs to

2575
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,400
fit into the charter cheers

2576
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:19,520
thank you

2577
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,840
uh eric

2578
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,639
come on on a similar line actually uh

2579
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:27,600
there was

2580
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,719
uh

2581
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:31,120
comments in the chat earlier about sort

2582
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,480
of different scene attacks and simple

2583
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,440
attacks

2584
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:35,679
and comments that differential privacy

2585
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:38,480
would be required and that the um

2586
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,960
uh the vdfs have um

2587
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:44,400
you know sort of had the scope for that

2588
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,600
is it

2589
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,280
meaningful to like

2590
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:50,239
say that these will support privacy

2591
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:52,800
respecting incorporation values

2592
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,920
um without having some definition of

2593
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,440
what we mean by

2594
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:59,120
a a

2595
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,639
private value

2596
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:03,440
or should that be here or should that be

2597
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:07,519
at the at the vdf level

2598
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,400
all right thanks

2599
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:17,440
uh charlie

2600
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:20,320
yeah i just wanted to uh

2601
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,560
i i guess drill in a little deeper in

2602
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,960
the charter of like what aggregation

2603
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,120
actually means and it might be good to

2604
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,080
have

2605
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:32,400
maybe like a definition there i see like

2606
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,400
with the server can't learn the value of

2607
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,480
individual measurements which maybe that

2608
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,120
suffices to say as long as that's the

2609
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:40,800
case you can't uh

2610
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,719
you can't have aggregate measurements

2611
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:44,320
but some of the use cases that we're

2612
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,639
considering like you know are not are

2613
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:49,120
don't very neatly fall into this realm

2614
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,560
of like you're learning in aggregate

2615
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:51,280
like

2616
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,159
you know

2617
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:54,560
you're if you learn like a private ml

2618
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,719
model that you can verify is you know

2619
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:58,080
differentially private or something like

2620
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:01,440
that would we consider that an aggregate

2621
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,400
like maybe maybe not um but it would be

2622
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:07,120
it would be great if there's you know

2623
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:09,199
at least from our perspective i think it

2624
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:10,960
would be great if things like

2625
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,679
ml models fit within this scope of the

2626
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:16,080
charter

2627
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:18,480
all right thanks

2628
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,959
andrew

2629
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,080
yeah just

2630
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,000
adding to the the early point uh i

2631
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,679
completely agree with the idea of adding

2632
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:30,880
in the use cases but uh just to echo a

2633
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:33,679
point that's come up in the chat um

2634
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:36,320
i think also consider adding uh abuse

2635
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:39,679
cases and ideally mitigations

2636
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:41,199
as well

2637
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:42,639
which might help alleviate some of the

2638
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:43,920
concerns

2639
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:46,400
about some of the dark practices in this

2640
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,199
uh general area thanks

2641
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:50,639
thank you

2642
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:53,639
watson

2643
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,480
watson i'm relaying a message from wendy

2644
01:32:58,480 --> 01:32:59,600
in the chat

2645
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,679
uh she said she wrote i'm just gonna

2646
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:04,080
first voice support from w3c for this

2647
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,239
work as there's working incubation that

2648
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:08,480
could use it

2649
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,560
ah thank you

2650
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,400
steven

2651
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,000
yeah just on the abuse cases use cases

2652
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,520
thing i think

2653
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,600
given that this i think is probably

2654
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:18,800
pretty

2655
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,760
good technology that could be used well

2656
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,360
i'm not too worried about documenting

2657
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:24,719
use cases and that could be a bit of a

2658
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:26,719
time sync but given that this good

2659
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:28,480
technology could be abused i think

2660
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,560
effort spent in that direction would be

2661
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,560
much more valuable

2662
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:33,760
particularly if we find ways of

2663
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:37,840
mitigating abuses that we see

2664
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:39,360
okay

2665
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:40,239
thanks

2666
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:42,480
nick

2667
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:52,400
nick 30 cdt and

2668
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,400
thanks for presenting all this everyone

2669
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,960
on the charter i had uh

2670
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:00,800
two questions or concerns for now um

2671
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,719
one i think we're talking about

2672
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:04,719
abuse and things like that but i also

2673
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:06,320
think there's a lot of the privacy that

2674
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:07,679
depends on

2675
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:09,040
um

2676
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,600
assumptions about

2677
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:14,800
non-collusion or about how the

2678
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,760
client is going to find the different

2679
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:20,080
servers or or configure them and i'm a

2680
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:21,040
little bit worried that that's all

2681
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,760
getting marked out of scope in in the

2682
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,440
hope that like

2683
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,360
uh maybe we can just ignore that problem

2684
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:30,560
or someone else will fix it i i'm i

2685
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:32,639
guess i think we should be discussing it

2686
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:34,159
if we're going to put a lot of effort

2687
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:35,280
into

2688
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:36,560
um

2689
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:37,760
into the work of the protocol that

2690
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:40,320
depends on those things um

2691
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,320
the other concern is about the name i

2692
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:43,920
think maybe it's come up a little bit

2693
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,760
already in the chat um i i think priv is

2694
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,560
is both very confusing does not describe

2695
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,960
the work that's happening about uh

2696
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:55,119
privacy preserving measurement

2697
01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:57,199
and actively misleading that this is the

2698
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:59,360
group doing everything about privacy or

2699
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:00,960
incorporation of values sounds like a

2700
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:02,239
very general

2701
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:03,760
concept that i would support but that

2702
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,840
this charter is not related to so i

2703
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,159
think it's uh actively misleading we

2704
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:10,799
should change it

2705
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,480
all right thank you

2706
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:15,199
uh so uh nick i'm going to ask that you

2707
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:16,239
send

2708
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:18,480
some concrete suggestions for your first

2709
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,920
bullet point to the list if you have

2710
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,320
some some time to do so

2711
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,920
thanks

2712
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,360
sure

2713
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:28,599
uh chris

2714
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:32,719
this plus one to that like i think it

2715
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:37,119
priv does seem overly broad um

2716
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:38,960
but also i wanted to address okay i want

2717
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:40,719
to talk about the abuse

2718
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:42,159
use cases people are talking about in

2719
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:44,080
chat so

2720
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,080
uh one of the things that was brought up

2721
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,080
is like what about clients like trying

2722
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:50,239
to like corrupt the computation by

2723
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:51,920
sending bogus inputs or something like

2724
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,080
that so that form of abuse is something

2725
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:56,480
that we're explicitly trying to rule out

2726
01:35:56,480 --> 01:36:00,960
so um in the in the so like a vdf is is

2727
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:04,320
verifiable in the sense that um invalid

2728
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,760
inputs can be detected and removed from

2729
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:12,400
the um output of of the computation

2730
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,520
all right thanks so just for

2731
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,440
clarification uh and i this is addressed

2732
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:18,880
at stephen um when we're talking about

2733
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,480
abuse cases is that the kind of abuse

2734
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,679
you're talking about are you talking

2735
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:23,280
about like abuse of the actual data

2736
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,840
being collected

2737
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,040
so

2738
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:29,360
again pardon my ignorance it's vast but

2739
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,760
uh so for example if this tech this this

2740
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:34,000
technology could be used to to measure

2741
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,920
things in two small in aggregates that

2742
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:38,719
are too small and that become exposing

2743
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:40,239
or if

2744
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:41,920
if some application had some kind of

2745
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,520
opt-in mechanism and then it was

2746
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:46,000
possible to change what gets measured in

2747
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,080
ways that are damaging for users those i

2748
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:50,080
think would be kind of abuses that are a

2749
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:51,119
bit

2750
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:52,639
you know a little bit less concrete than

2751
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:55,280
the example given um

2752
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:56,400
you know

2753
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,360
all right

2754
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:58,800
it's i was just i was hearing what i

2755
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,159
thought were two senses of abuse and

2756
01:37:00,159 --> 01:37:02,000
that appears to be the case so thank you

2757
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,600
very much

2758
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,199
yeah but i'm not i'm explicitly not

2759
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:06,560
asking that we try and fix everything

2760
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,080
because it might not might not be fixed

2761
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:09,679
fixable but if we can think about it in

2762
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:11,840
detail and propose what mitigations are

2763
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:14,000
possible then i think that that would be

2764
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,320
good

2765
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:18,000
thank you very much

2766
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
yuri

2767
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:23,199
thank you um so plus one on the name

2768
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:26,080
confusion issue uh plus one on talking

2769
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,719
about abuse cases and i i think that's

2770
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:30,800
mostly by the you know whoever is doing

2771
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,639
the measurements not not so much about

2772
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:33,679
the

2773
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:36,880
abuse by by the user users should still

2774
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,080
be able to

2775
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:40,080
produce the data that they want to

2776
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:42,320
produce as long as it's sort of within

2777
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:43,760
bounds

2778
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:44,560
um

2779
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,719
the other thing is that i i think um

2780
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:48,400
maybe there's some room for

2781
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:51,040
a discussion of opt-in opt-out type of

2782
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,199
um solutions and if we

2783
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:55,040
learn from some other

2784
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:57,440
protocol cases like first in quick

2785
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:58,960
there's the spin bit

2786
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:00,960
where there's an arrangement that some

2787
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,719
fraction of the users are automatically

2788
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:04,639
always excluded from

2789
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:06,800
from spinning um in order to create this

2790
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:09,119
set of users that don't do a particular

2791
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:10,239
action and

2792
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:11,679
similar techniques might actually apply

2793
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:14,320
here that you automatically exclude some

2794
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:17,520
set of users um and then you sort of

2795
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,920
create this opportunity to uh not do

2796
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:22,639
this and users can opt out without being

2797
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:24,880
targeted as opt-outers

2798
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,480
and so i think that that kind of thing

2799
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,719
would be important um i don't have the

2800
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:30,960
specific language for the charter

2801
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:33,119
or maybe something about um

2802
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:35,760
you know enabling opt-in and opt-out or

2803
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:38,320
realistic opt-in and opt-out

2804
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,719
possibilities thank you

2805
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:42,320
thanks

2806
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:45,320
hacker

2807
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:47,920
generally uh just the opt-in thing of

2808
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,119
generally these are these are

2809
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:51,119
configuration points of some kind and

2810
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:52,719
clients um

2811
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:55,520
um you know uh um

2812
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,280
you know the question of exactly how how

2813
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:59,040
users decide whether that got actually

2814
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,719
engaged is like it's like not generally

2815
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:03,520
saying we were too much itf um

2816
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:06,400
the um uh the points even making are

2817
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,080
absolutely correct um

2818
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:10,639
like um you know uh there's like a whole

2819
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:12,000
pile of material that has to be done

2820
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,800
about ensuring that this system the box

2821
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,400
the system is in does not allow for

2822
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,480
abuse by by the collector or by or by

2823
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,239
the various aggregators um and that's

2824
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:22,480
like a that's a big topic that

2825
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:23,679
um that like absolutely have to make

2826
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:25,199
sure we hit properly um there's some

2827
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:26,480
work already in the document about it

2828
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,800
but like it's it's insufficient so i

2829
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:31,360
think i would um uh i'd love to see

2830
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:32,560
somebody suggest some text but i think

2831
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,400
absolutely having um

2832
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,239
uh uh um

2833
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:37,440
uh

2834
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,040
like some

2835
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:40,560
like i think having zion texas if we had

2836
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,639
to work on you know um actually like

2837
01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:43,760
addressing those topics would be really

2838
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,080
important

2839
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:48,880
okay

2840
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:49,679
um

2841
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:53,080
all right martin

2842
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,280
just to just a yari's point a lot of the

2843
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:59,920
systems that um

2844
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,400
are being described here allow people to

2845
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,400
to opt out of the system without

2846
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,800
apparently opting out they can generate

2847
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,480
the inputs to the system

2848
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,320
that appear to all intents and purposes

2849
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,639
as valid inputs to the system but

2850
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:14,320
they're not actually contributing any

2851
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,560
any values to the system

2852
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,080
and that's actually a useful property

2853
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:21,119
that is exploited in various ways

2854
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:23,760
so um i think that that capability

2855
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,119
exists

2856
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:26,960
i'm not sure that we need to put those

2857
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,520
sorts of things into a charter

2858
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:31,920
i do think that we need to include some

2859
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:33,600
of the

2860
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:34,800
i think we need to include something

2861
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:37,360
generic about abuse there is something

2862
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,600
very specific about abuse in here about

2863
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,840
proofs of validity but um

2864
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:44,000
i've spent quite a lot of time thinking

2865
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,920
about things like civil attacks on

2866
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:47,679
various manifestations of these sorts of

2867
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:49,280
protocols and and those would be

2868
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,800
interesting things to

2869
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,119
to have at least

2870
01:40:53,119 --> 01:40:56,400
in the auspices of the group

2871
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,440
uh so a slightly different thread that i

2872
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,199
meant to ask a while ago

2873
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:09,679
um has there been any thought put on

2874
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:12,239
what type of ecosystem we really want to

2875
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:14,639
develop with this technology

2876
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:16,639
let's consider the fact that collectors

2877
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:18,880
need to take data from

2878
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,440
helpers and leaders essentially

2879
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:24,159
and are we expecting a small number of

2880
01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:25,760
helpers and leaders that will be

2881
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:28,639
accepted by particular collectors or

2882
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:31,440
you know can i and steven stand up our

2883
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,440
own helpers and leaders and expect

2884
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,840
everything to accept data that we submit

2885
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,600
to it because the two of us agree that

2886
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,360
we trust each other but

2887
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:41,119
uh but the collectors you know are the

2888
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:42,719
collector's only going to accept data

2889
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:45,119
from certain places and so we end up

2890
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:46,400
with either a very small very

2891
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:49,520
centralized ecosystem or uh or you know

2892
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,960
a much more flexible framework

2893
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:55,109
[Music]

2894
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:59,600
thanks yuri

2895
01:41:59,679 --> 01:42:01,840
yes so just a quick response to martin

2896
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:03,920
so that's that's really good news um and

2897
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:06,080
i wasn't looking for documenting any of

2898
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,440
that uh

2899
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,600
detail in in the charter perhaps the

2900
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,360
high level bit about

2901
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:12,960
being effective

2902
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:15,119
opt-out mechanisms could could be in the

2903
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:17,360
charter thank you

2904
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:18,400
thanks

2905
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,719
ecker

2906
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:23,920
the answer is question um i think

2907
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,119
there's a bunch of like compatible

2908
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:27,440
models um i think the important thing to

2909
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,520
remember is that the person who i'm

2910
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,280
going back to the right model i had i i

2911
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:33,840
put up earlier right that um the the

2912
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,400
collector has to trust um the to help

2913
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,880
the aggregators but the clients also

2914
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,239
trust the aggregators because because

2915
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:41,360
aggro is responsible for starting the

2916
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:43,760
client's privacy and so as a practical

2917
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:45,600
matter i would expect i would anticipate

2918
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:46,719
that you know

2919
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:47,679
um

2920
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:48,800
that that there that you know there'll

2921
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:50,320
be a

2922
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:53,119
a a non like you know a non-gigantic

2923
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:54,719
number of collectors of different

2924
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:56,639
aggregators because fundamentally you're

2925
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:58,159
you're trusting them to behave correctly

2926
01:42:58,159 --> 01:42:59,679
right so what you just you know what you

2927
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:01,040
and stephen probably has worked up

2928
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:02,400
except for like maybe you know maybe i

2929
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:05,280
people intimidated that um um but um

2930
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:07,040
because people probably rely on relying

2931
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:08,880
on the rotations of the collectors oh

2932
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,400
sorry the aggregators but i mean this is

2933
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:11,760
compatible with like an arbitrarily

2934
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,600
large number um i would expect to see

2935
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,119
really two models that we talked about

2936
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:18,000
um one of which is um you know people

2937
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,840
who operate just as just as aggregators

2938
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:21,360
and are basically their job is to ensure

2939
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,880
the safety system and then people who

2940
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,080
operate sort of like a more global

2941
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:25,840
system where it's like you know i like

2942
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,040
if you see amplitude but it's like you

2943
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:28,400
know look i am like data collection of

2944
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:31,760
the service and like you know i i i i

2945
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:32,960
contract with several several different

2946
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,400
aggregators and that's how i provide the

2947
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,320
system in a box so i put this to those

2948
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,639
two models but um there's nothing really

2949
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:39,600
centralized here there's something

2950
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:40,960
there's like no there's no reason you

2951
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:43,280
know like every you know

2952
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:44,719
like plenty of like trustworthy entities

2953
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:46,480
in the world and um and so there's

2954
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:48,159
nothing that basically requires like

2955
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:50,960
that like a good the collector a work

2956
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:52,719
with it same set of aggregators as

2957
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:55,119
quantum b

2958
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:00,639
uh chris

2959
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,440
to bump what eckerd just said but also

2960
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,920
uh also kind of point out that something

2961
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:09,600
that we've been working on in the

2962
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:10,880
protocol

2963
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:11,840
is

2964
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:14,080
lowering the bar of entry to running

2965
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,560
this this system as much as we can so

2966
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:19,119
there's a sort of asymmetry between

2967
01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:21,520
leader and helper so the leader is

2968
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:24,719
uh you know and and this could change um

2969
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:26,480
uh depending on what p what people's

2970
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:28,159
needs turn out to be

2971
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:30,320
but what we have been thinking about so

2972
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:32,719
far is the helper should be very very

2973
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:35,119
cheap to run and operate

2974
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:36,480
and a leader is inherently more

2975
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:39,119
expensive because it's getting

2976
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:41,679
measurements directly from clients it

2977
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:43,440
has to store them for some amount of

2978
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,040
time

2979
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:48,639
before they can begin processing them um

2980
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:50,159
how much you have to store and how long

2981
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:52,080
you have to store it depends on the vda

2982
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:53,840
if you're running

2983
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,360
so but

2984
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:56,960
i think this is one of our goals and i

2985
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:59,040
think this is um

2986
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:01,119
important thing to keep in mind

2987
01:45:01,119 --> 01:45:03,040
regardless of like how the ecosystem

2988
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:05,520
pans out we want it to make we want to

2989
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,440
make the bar bar to entry as low as

2990
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:10,239
possible i think

2991
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,639
all right thank you very much

2992
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:13,840
um

2993
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,199
so at this point we'd like to go ahead

2994
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:17,360
and move on to some questions to inform

2995
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:19,679
the the area directors and the iasg

2996
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:22,159
about community interest for this

2997
01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:24,159
i'm going to go ahead and bring up polls

2998
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:25,760
for each of these

2999
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,000
but also at certain points we're going

3000
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,800
to ask that if you are not in support of

3001
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,000
forming the working group that you go

3002
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,560
ahead and put yourself in the queue

3003
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:38,239
so for the first question

3004
01:45:39,119 --> 01:45:41,360
i'm going to ask

3005
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:44,880
who supports a working group

3006
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:47,199
with this charter

3007
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:48,960
and this is modulo any changes that

3008
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,639
we've discussed today or come up in the

3009
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:51,840
mailing list

3010
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:55,239
shortly afterwards

3011
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:10,320
and again if you if you don't support

3012
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:13,360
the charter and have not yet spoken we

3013
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:18,119
urge you to join the microphone queue

3014
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:42,239
okay we seem to have

3015
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:44,080
slowed down so thank you very much for

3016
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:46,800
the input on that

3017
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:53,360
the next question we're going to ask is

3018
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:55,600
uh do we think uh

3019
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,159
um do you have something to say alyssa

3020
01:46:58,159 --> 01:46:59,840
well maybe we should take them one at a

3021
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,239
time so we can hear from

3022
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:03,600
uh

3023
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:05,840
from the folks who did not raise their

3024
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:09,760
hand or explicitly left their hand down

3025
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:11,600
yes i i don't see anyone in the queue

3026
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,840
though

3027
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:17,440
okay i just want to make sure it was

3028
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:19,199
clear to people that now is the time to

3029
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:21,040
to do that if you have something to say

3030
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:23,119
about it yes

3031
01:47:23,119 --> 01:47:25,360
thanks

3032
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,239
okay we can move to the next one

3033
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:30,000
thanks

3034
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
so for our second poll

3035
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,360
do we think the problem statement is

3036
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:36,159
clear well-scoped solvable and useful to

3037
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:38,480
solve

3038
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:43,840
ted go ahead

3039
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:45,679
is this also a module of the discussion

3040
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:46,960
in the chat because there was a good bit

3041
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:50,159
of it that really did help

3042
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:52,560
uh i would imagine yes i have been

3043
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,719
following the chat myself um

3044
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:56,159
but i would hope that any ceiling points

3045
01:47:56,159 --> 01:47:57,520
for that would also be brought to the

3046
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:00,080
mailing list

3047
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:04,679
sorry i'm looking at the

3048
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:09,520
ted i mean the answer to that is yes i

3049
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:12,320
mean the work that the charter itself uh

3050
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:14,239
is going to require some edits we've had

3051
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:16,800
some good kind of feedback here so

3052
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,719
consider the chat and

3053
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:21,800
the presentations

3054
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,679
so again if you have you have concerns

3055
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:46,480
about the the scoping here and have not

3056
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:48,639
yet spoken on them uh please add

3057
01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:50,719
yourself to the microphone queue

3058
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:52,320
so we can understand better your

3059
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:55,320
position

3060
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:24,159
nick go ahead please

3061
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:29,320
um

3062
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:31,199
just uh

3063
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:33,440
okay probably yeah okay doing polls like

3064
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:36,239
this is is tricky because we're uh

3065
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:39,520
chatting about possible variations i i

3066
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:42,000
agree but um i think we have this like

3067
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,400
very open question about are use cases

3068
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:46,480
and abuse cases going to be put into the

3069
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:48,639
charter or are they going to be a

3070
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:49,760
work item

3071
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:51,360
um

3072
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:53,040
and

3073
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,040
and until

3074
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:57,040
until some of that is settled until we

3075
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:59,360
actually are going to define them then i

3076
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:01,040
think that

3077
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03,199
it's it's harder to conclude that the

3078
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:05,920
problem statement is is uh completely

3079
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:08,080
clear if we're not actually agreed on

3080
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:11,760
the use and abuses

3081
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:13,599
thank you

3082
01:50:13,599 --> 01:50:16,159
okay robin

3083
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:22,080
and again a personal statement not on

3084
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:24,719
behalf of isoc um

3085
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:26,880
uh i think the discussion in the chat

3086
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:29,440
about even the name of the group and

3087
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:31,520
most of the proposed names did not have

3088
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:33,920
the word value in values

3089
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:35,840
uh raises

3090
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:38,080
questions about the the scope and intent

3091
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,679
to the group that are fundamental enough

3092
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:42,159
that question two is very difficult to

3093
01:50:42,159 --> 01:50:44,960
answer as nick said

3094
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:48,159
ah okay thank you

3095
01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:55,760
all right so uh ecker go ahead

3096
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,679
people seem to be like a little worked

3097
01:50:57,679 --> 01:50:58,880
up about the name i just want to say

3098
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,719
like like what happened with the name is

3099
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:02,480
like we're calling this ppm privacy

3100
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:03,840
return measurement people was too close

3101
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:07,360
to ippm i like got punchy and like

3102
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:08,960
trying to figure out how to say priv so

3103
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:11,040
like like really like there's like like

3104
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,480
that's what's going on here so like if

3105
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:13,679
you want to like that like suggest

3106
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:16,800
something else because like like the the

3107
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,159
like every every letter in there was

3108
01:51:18,159 --> 01:51:20,000
like constructed to make it say priv not

3109
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,360
for any actual reason other than that

3110
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:26,239
thank you

3111
01:51:27,199 --> 01:51:28,960
okay and then the final two questions

3112
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:31,199
that we're going to have um

3113
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:33,199
typically we would have raised of hands

3114
01:51:33,199 --> 01:51:35,840
of this in a physical room

3115
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:37,920
because we do like to keep track of who

3116
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:39,760
exactly answered yes but

3117
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:41,280
to do that effectively here we're going

3118
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:43,679
to ask people in the chat if you are

3119
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:45,760
willing to review documents associated

3120
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:47,360
with this working group please respond

3121
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:49,839
with review

3122
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,400
okay so i've seen uh on the order of 20

3123
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,560
people respond so far

3124
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:10,080
this is a

3125
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:11,599
very strong signal

3126
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:15,440
um and secondly uh who here plans to be

3127
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:18,000
an editor for related documents please

3128
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,119
respond with edit in the chat

3129
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:38,639
all right

3130
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:40,639
great well thank you very much um that

3131
01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:42,080
takes us to the end of the things we

3132
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:43,840
wanted to discuss for this buff i think

3133
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:46,000
this has been very useful and i want to

3134
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,840
give a few moments over to our area

3135
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:48,880
director

3136
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:51,360
to speak

3137
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,239
hi everyone i'd like hi everyone i'd

3138
01:52:56,239 --> 01:52:58,159
like to repeat uh i think we've had a

3139
01:52:58,159 --> 01:52:59,679
successful buff and i want to thank

3140
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:01,840
everyone for kind of all their input i

3141
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:04,639
think the chat was just as lively uh as

3142
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:07,679
as the mic line if not more i mean

3143
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:09,679
generally what i heard was there is a

3144
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:12,080
critical mass of interest in working in

3145
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:13,920
this kind of particular problem

3146
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:16,560
there was repeated the tension i heard

3147
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:18,800
around this idea of you know are we okay

3148
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:21,840
working on ad tech and the ad use cases

3149
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:23,360
you know at the same time recognizing

3150
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:25,599
that that is the reality on the ground

3151
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:27,840
and that there would be wider

3152
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,520
applicability of this tech

3153
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:31,679
much larger these protocols much larger

3154
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:33,840
than that particular kind of use case i

3155
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:35,440
think in the charter discussion we're

3156
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:37,440
not ready to go with this particular

3157
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:39,599
charter there were a number of really

3158
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:41,360
kind of helpful suggestions about how to

3159
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:43,119
polish that and we'll double check and

3160
01:53:43,119 --> 01:53:45,360
kind of confirm that so specific things

3161
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,760
i heard reading off my list is things

3162
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:49,679
like let's generalize the charter text

3163
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:51,599
to make sure we're sufficiently flexible

3164
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:53,520
so we can swap approaches so it's not

3165
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:55,520
just pre-owned the heavy hitters we need

3166
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:57,199
to make sure that how we define

3167
01:53:57,199 --> 01:54:00,320
aggregation doesn't restrict uh you know

3168
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,560
other kind of alternatives we talked

3169
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:04,880
about the need for work items to

3170
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:06,719
document the abuse cases and talk about

3171
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:08,719
the threat models against all the

3172
01:54:08,719 --> 01:54:11,040
portions of of the architecture and then

3173
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:13,040
we had quite a lot of conversations that

3174
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:15,040
we need to tune the working group name i

3175
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:17,040
don't know what the solution is uh but

3176
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:19,440
that we would like a change there

3177
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:22,000
and so i think the proponents seem open

3178
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,480
to making kind of those changes and that

3179
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:26,239
will those changes will be made and then

3180
01:54:26,239 --> 01:54:28,239
we'll bring that back for confirmation

3181
01:54:28,239 --> 01:54:29,840
but otherwise i think we do have a

3182
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:31,760
critical mass and we should we should

3183
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:34,560
kind of polish this uh to consensus and

3184
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:38,480
so we can move forward thank you

3185
01:54:40,159 --> 01:54:41,199
thank you very much for everyone

3186
01:54:41,199 --> 01:54:42,719
attending this this was a very well

3187
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:44,719
attended buff

3188
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:47,360
have a good rest of your day

3189
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:50,080
thanks

3190
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:52,719
for taking notes

3191
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:55,280
oh yes thank you very much peter

3192
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:57,360
and thank you to the chairs for bringing

3193
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:59,199
us all together and leading us through a

3194
01:54:59,199 --> 01:55:01,919
good conversation

3195
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,639
all right thanks all

3196
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:06,880
peter did you want to say something

3197
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,639
oh just thanks
