1
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,039
hello everyone

2
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,599
i hope you can hear me

3
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:30,800
um

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,000
it is

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
9 30 where i am

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,719
which means that it is time for

7
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,719
the session to start

8
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,360
i'm gonna give people a couple minutes

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,520
especially because i'm missing my

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,079
co-chairs

11
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,800
no there we go

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,360
can someone confirm that you can hear me

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,760
you can hear you yes we can

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,120
there we go i can hear you guys too

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,120
thanks

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
so

17
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,719
any insight on the location that's been

18
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,360
chosen for ietf113

19
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,478
um

20
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,560
yes so there has been

21
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,879
um the llcj specifically has been

22
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,120
looking at different sites

23
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,000
um

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,319
i believe it has been made public that

25
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,800
we are not considering

26
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
asia

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,360
um

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,400
and

29
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,080
we're not considering north america

30
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,360
either

31
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,160
so all i can say right now is that it

32
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,680
will be

33
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,319
most likely in europe

34
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,959
that's probably not a lot of insight but

35
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,640
no they said that last week at the

36
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,200
plenary

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
we were hoping for the location in

38
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,400
europe

39
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,720
right so i think the um

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,840
more inside info

41
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,640
yeah it's hard to say more inside info

42
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,400
on the public forum being recorded and

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,280
transmitted through youtube

44
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,560
but uh

45
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,760
yeah so i believe that we're in the

46
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,840
final phase of getting the contract

47
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,120
signed and

48
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,360
um

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,440
you know figuring that out uh things are

50
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,040
changing of course in europe all the

51
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,120
time and um

52
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,720
that's all that's all i can say i guess

53
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,040
right now

54
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,840
yeah so antoine just said in the chat

55
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,440
that the code cases are going up again

56
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,400
in europe

57
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,120
so yes um i i don't know how that's

58
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,720
affecting the negotiations because i'm

59
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,080
not part of that

60
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,400
but um yes those are things that we're

61
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,200
all keeping an eye on

62
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,959
so we got martin

63
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:51,840
we

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,519
seem to have lost john

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,959
or

66
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,239
he couldn't find the way here

67
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,159
i mean this is the routing area i don't

68
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,080
know

69
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,599
i had that side meeting uh on multicast

70
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,360
uh

71
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,360
sr maybe that's where he is i don't know

72
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,639
he was in that room and they are overrun

73
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,120
so uh martin what do you think should we

74
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,360
start

75
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,240
do you hear me

76
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,199
yep

77
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,880
yeah i think we should but john john

78
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,560
should uh

79
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,400
should join us in a few minutes

80
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,720
yeah i'm assuming there's probably other

81
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,320
people um

82
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,560
other routing people not just other

83
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,479
people otherwise people in that uh site

84
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,759
meeting as well

85
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,520
that will probably join us

86
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,320
um so when we start with the

87
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,320
audience trivia this is the roadinger

88
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,800
open meeting uh you can probably see me

89
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,199
on the video martin can maybe show

90
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,880
himself too

91
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,479
in case you don't know what would look

92
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,919
like or have forgotten over the last

93
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,000
couple of years

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,199
john is the

95
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,840
other id and he should be here in a

96
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,560
couple of minutes

97
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,600
you have

98
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,520
all been aware of the note well and

99
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,639
hopefully you have all noticed that we

100
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,000
all the chairs of the different working

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,840
groups have been highlighting not just

102
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,440
the ipr nature

103
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,759
of the note well but the parts that talk

104
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,000
about the behavior and the conduct

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,080
uh during the meetings

106
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,520
there are links here

107
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120
to

108
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,280
the anti-harassment procedures to the

109
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,560
code of conduct

110
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,479
uh please make yourself familiar with

111
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,280
that

112
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,960
um

113
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,039
make sure that whatever behavior that

114
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,840
you display in the meetings including

115
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,039
um

116
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,199
all the virtual meetings the the jabber

117
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,600
or the meat echo and some messaging that

118
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,759
they all adhere to that

119
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,840
some of the

120
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
points in the pro conduct which is rc

121
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,560
7154 are the ones here

122
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,639
the reason we're here all of us is to of

123
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,720
course contribute to

124
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,160
the ongoing work of the atf

125
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,479
which is meant to make the internet grow

126
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,080
work better

127
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,319
we're here to do engineering

128
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,360
please

129
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,520
focus on that focus on on technical

130
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,720
arguments

131
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,199
focus on treating uh your colleagues

132
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,720
with respect

133
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,319
um english is the

134
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,160
uh i guess the fact the language of the

135
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,880
atf and you know that's fine many of us

136
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,039
don't speak english as a first language

137
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,840
so please be mindful of that as well

138
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,360
speak slowly

139
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,080
try to avoid slang

140
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,560
etc

141
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,800
we're always looking for feedback um

142
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,520
on how we're doing sadies uh not only

143
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,960
what's going well which is always nice

144
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,479
to hear but more importantly what may

145
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,599
not be

146
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,840
going well what may be broken with the

147
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,759
area or what uh you know things we could

148
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,319
do better

149
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,800
many of you hopefully saw

150
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,759
a survey a few weeks ago

151
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,440
it actually concluded i think earlier

152
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,560
this week

153
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,680
on a 360 evaluation experiment that we

154
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,360
did for the aesg

155
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,960
so where you could have uh you know send

156
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,280
feedback about us specifically uh the

157
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,800
three of us cds

158
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,240
uh that was a good opportunity if you

159
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,800
want to talk to us individually

160
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,560
uh either directly or indirectly if you

161
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,960
want to tell john or martin

162
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,039
about me and you don't want to tell me

163
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,879
directly that's fine you know tell them

164
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,840
they can anonymize things this is also a

165
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,919
good time to talk to the namco

166
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,639
about not just the candidates to become

167
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,919
a d

168
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,280
next time and starting in march but also

169
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,560
about

170
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,759
um

171
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,039
you know the ongoing work that we're

172
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,440
doing um they

173
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,319
also take care of of anonymizing of

174
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,479

281
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,639
are having totally a total of 15 drafts

282
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,680

289
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,160
group in last year and this year

290
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,480
and i think we have a few

291
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,360
the top working group is coming from the

292
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,079
best idr and of course we have also done

293
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,920
a lot of work to review the other

294
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,399
working groups works

295
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,760
and

296
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,399
next please

297
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,920
so here is some

298
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,839
review result of the

299
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,360
the real result and basically we have

300
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,120
one third of them

301
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,000
with ready one third with net so one

302
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,760
third with

303
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,480
some issues and we feedback this to

304
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,320
corresponding working groups to further

305
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,079
discussion and

306
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,360
before we proceed into the iesd review

307
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,639
and on the right hand side there is some

308
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,519
non-rtg error drafts review result and

309
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,079
i think a half of them are having issues

310
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,120
and

311
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,600
maybe one-fourth of them has needs and

312
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,839
some of them

313
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,120
there are also

314
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,079
19

315
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,880
with ready status so

316
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,920
that is just a basic capture for the uh

317
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,000
for the for the review of work in last

318
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,320

325
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,880
thank you

326
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,160
does anyone have any questions

327
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,959

328
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,360
uh helps a lot i know it helps me as an

329
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,079
ad to get reviews from you guys uh don

330
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,479
go ahead

331
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:07,760
so

332
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,160
how does a draft in these pictures fit

333
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,480
like just one into one category

334
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,800
like it i notice it adds up to 100

335
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,600
so i would assume that you know not

336
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,079
ready and nits are

337
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,599
not mutually exclusive etc

338
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,920
uh hellman do you want to answer that or

339
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,639
um i guess but it's not

340
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,959
um

341
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,959
honestly uh

342
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,199
the worst status you i mean the the

343
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,320
worst status is the one that it gets

344
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,880
logged in as the status of the draft

345
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,360
like if it's not ready that's the worst

346
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,639
you know and that's the one that gets

347
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,160
logged and in decreasing uh severity

348
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,079
that that would be

349
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,519
how the statistics are taken

350
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,839
thanks a.c jeff

351
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,480
okay um so a question to the directorate

352
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,000
since i haven't participated in it for a

353
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,839
number of years

354
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,680
what would be the single biggest change

355
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,839
you'd recommend for cleaning up the

356
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,839
draft before it gets to you that you

357
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,120
think the working group should do better

358
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,440
about

359
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,360
um

360
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,199
that's that's a a good question

361
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,720
you know personally i've noticed that um

362
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,000
when i get some of the drafts and you

363
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,120
know this answer may be different from

364
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,560
john martin

365
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,600
there are

366
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,519
some basic things

367
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,959
that could be checked you know

368
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,240
references

369
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,880
um security considerations

370
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,520
um you know i still see many drafts that

371
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,400
say

372
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,640
there are no security considerations

373
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,480
and while in some cases that may

374
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,079
actually be true it would be at least

375
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,760
nice to explain why

376
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,760
um there are none of them

377
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,599
um you know there are basic things with

378
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,000
uh ayana allocations

379
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,039
um

380
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,720
you know maybe the the iana section is

381
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
not complete or the name of the

382
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,079
registries

383
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,240
are not um

384
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,320
are not well well specified or you know

385
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,000
things not along those lines

386
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,679
that i think are are

387
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,440
easy or should be very long hanging

388
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,200
fruit for not just the directorate but

389
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,679
the working group to to pick up

390
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,400
um i would of course also expect that

391
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,720
um it wouldn't be us

392
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,919
to

393
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,679
the ones who find

394
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,400
technical issues with the documents

395
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,080
um that doesn't happen all the time but

396
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,520
it happens once in a while

397
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,240
and uh if they have gone through

398
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,080
the review of the experts in the working

399
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,240
groups well that yeah you guys know a

400
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,760
lot more than we do

401
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,919
so that that shouldn't be the case

402
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,760
um i don't know john martin if you want

403
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,480
to add anything

404
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,240
i thought that was a pretty good a

405
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,760
pretty good summary i don't really have

406
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,640
anything to add thank you

407
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,039
jeff you want to oh same here

408
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,360
thanks

409
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,640
yeah so jeff suggested on the chat that

410
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
this sounds like a sort of a checklist

411
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,480
uh yeah maybe there's we can make a

412
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,160
checklist i

413
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,440
am under the impression that maybe

414
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
there's something in the uh wiki

415
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,919
somewhere i know that adrian had done a

416
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,360
presentation

417
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,039
when he was a d

418
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,720
about some of the things

419
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,640
uh maybe we can dig that up and put it

420
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,440
somewhere too

421
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,840
right i mean

422
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,280
with checklist i mean i guess there's

423
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,960
two things one is

424
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,559
now there's a bunch of things one is

425
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,640
having a good checklist one is keeping

426
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,160
it up to date

427
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,960
and one is actually getting people to

428
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,360
use it um at the appropriate time and

429
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,960
the getting people to use it seems like

430
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,480
the hardest part

431
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,200
um like ideally authors would actually

432
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,360
go through and read the um checklists

433
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,200
for authors

434
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,880
that already exist

435
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,600
and act on them and if they did

436
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,559
uh

437
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,080
probably

438
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,039
you know

439
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,640
most of the things that we catch in

440
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,640
review wouldn't even happen

441
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,240
because they're already in the checklist

442
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,360
that the authors supposedly are

443
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,559
reading through

444
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,160
um

445
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,120
so

446
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,360
yeah i mean i'm like are we not

447
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,200
publicizing the checklist well enough

448
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,960
are we not letting our authors know

449
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,000
about them well enough uh are the are

450
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,799
the checklists you know

451
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,280
too heavy and and not usable by the

452
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,039
authors like all of this would be useful

453
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,039
feedback

454
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,880
um

455
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,159
i was uh

456
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,120
thinking

457
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,120
for just a minute i got confused and i

458
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,320
was like oh we already have the

459
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,600
checklist it's that long uh write-up

460
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,960
list

461
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,480
you know when you do a write-up as a

462
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,440
shepherd

463
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,120
um

464
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,400
it doesn't have everything you just

465
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,159
mentioned but you know i immediately

466
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,840
thought of it right because it goes you

467
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,080
know it doesn't have an iana section is

468
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,240
that you know blah blah blah

469
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,080
uh

470
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,440
maybe uh

471
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,120
maybe the write-up should be done before

472
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,879
the routing area or review

473
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,080
i just went through the through this

474
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,400
process with the ip second

475
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,600
it was very weird um i felt it was very

476
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,679
weird that the chair asked me as the

477
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,440
author of the document to write the

478
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,280
write-up

479
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,480
um

480
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,200
but it wasn't an entirely horrible

481
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,840
idea because it actually you know and

482
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,520
that's what he said was

483
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,880
you know it sort of makes sure that all

484
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,760
the stuff is there

485
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,440
anyway that's why i thought of that i

486
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,440
think

487
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,520
sorry it's a good point about uh

488
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,159
so so chris just to follow up on that it

489
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,600
sounds like

490
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,640
you know um as an author you

491
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,720
found that to be uh actually

492
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,919
a better experience than you thought it

493
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,360
would be and like

494
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,159
if will you ask your authors

495
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,640
to do that also like is it that good of

496
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,039
an experience

497
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,360
you know i don't know um but i think

498
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,000
that it could possibly um stuart can you

499
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,720
mute for a second

500
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,480
hear myself

501
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,280
um

502
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,840
yeah so thanks uh

503
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,520
i don't know if i'd do the write-up but

504
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
it just it didn't bring to mind like

505
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,280
having you know the checklist right and

506
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,320
um you know maybe just taking that that

507
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,559
was useful as in that in that sense of

508
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,799
course i write write-ups a lot so it was

509
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,559
very easy for me so i don't know if i

510
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,520
would ask

511
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,480
all the authors to do it

512
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,000
but i mean it just occurred to me that

513
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,360
that seems like a good way to get the

514
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,000
authors to to look at the checklist

515
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,840
yeah no i mean that's exactly what i

516
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,320
found right but you know and hopefully

517
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,640
to also um you know reduce the load on

518
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,760
the shepard

519
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,039
who presumably has to go through

520
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,360
everything that the author put into the

521
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,919
into the write-up anyway and verify it

522
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,240
it wasn't a bad idea um i we just have a

523
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,240
lot of graybeards i wonder if they'll

524
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,520
they'll scoff

525
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,120
what are you going to do the write-up

526
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,360
now

527
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,200
anyway thanks yeah

528
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,559
um so uh stuart you had gone off the

529
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,918
queue i thought you were next

530
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,240
um so um first off it seems to me that

531
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,799
before directorate get it really ought

532
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,000
to be

533
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,120
uh reviewed by the um

534
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,840
uh by the shepherd uh and that means to

535
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,000
me a word by word review of everything

536
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,640
in a complete list that every eye is

537
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,039
dotted and every t is crossed i don't

538
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,320
see why

539
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,840
it would be otherwise

540
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,600
and if there's more questions that could

541
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,200
be usefully added to the shepherds

542
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,440
report to make sure that some of these

543
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,640
things are done i think that would be a

544
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,400
very useful um a very useful uh reminder

545
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,480
that uh this needs to be done if the

546
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,919
shepherd wants to pass some of it back

547
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,760
to the working group fine but it

548
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,919
shouldn't get to directorate without the

549
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,000
shepherd having checked everything in in

550
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
detail

551
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,360
unless it's an early review right

552
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,840
sorry

553
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,440
second oh there's there's there's also

554
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,840
the early review i've assumed that that

555
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,159
sort of goes before

556
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,320
write-up

557
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,679
well there's the chairs review that

558
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,159
should also go through all this as well

559
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,919
yeah yeah no but i mean i think early

560
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,159
review is to sort of catch like dumb

561
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,159
ideas i i don't know i don't know what

562
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,000
they're we don't if you

563
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
look at lsr we don't have any so

564
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,159
it shouldn't really be going to any

565
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,000
directorate until the chair has read

566
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,200
every word and confirmed it's all okay

567
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,600
that's just basic chair duty 101 isn't

568
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,600
it

569
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,440
don europe i mean i guess we could talk

570
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,360
about you know

571
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,640
what exactly

572
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,480
is early direct review for and what do

573
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,919
people you know want to use it for it

574
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,240
like

575
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,720
my own experience of it is that it's

576
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,799
sort of like

577
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,320
when the chair says yeah this thing is

578
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,919
pretty close to being ready but we want

579
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,440
somebody outside of the group to review

580
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,320
it and give it a sanity check um

581
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,120
and

582
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,600
that kind of review is pretty different

583
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,480
from

584
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,159
you know sending it for last call review

585
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,159
so so i agree stuart with what you're

586
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,080
saying about you know if if we're doing

587
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,400
a direct review for last call i'm not so

588
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,960
sure about um doing it for an early

589
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,360
review

590
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,440
yeah i i think a checklist would be

591
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,480
great i

592
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
as a as an author i

593
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,039
you know guilty of waiting till like the

594
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,880
end type of thing and then you know you

595
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
do the nits check you do the submissions

596
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,120
checks and you put it in

597
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,120
and what i've i've done a number of yang

598
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,960
drafts recently and i've i've been

599
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,120
tripped up by the system

600
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,400
and and

601
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,600
even just

602
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,480
like

603
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,120
um mechanical checks that

604
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,320
uh

605
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,159
i missed because they're not part of

606
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,640
this this mission process but

607
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,000
um

608
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,640
i i think it would be you know a good

609
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,320
mindset to just

610
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,080
get people to do that earlier in the

611
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,559
process

612
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,159
so i placed it in the chat a couple of

613
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,600
links one the most recent to

614
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,320
the id guidelines which is an id

615
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,919
checklist

616
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,440
um

617
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,360
in the asg we revised that a couple

618
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,520
months ago so we republished a refreshed

619
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,760
version of that

620
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,480
you might want to go take a look um and

621
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,960
then i also posted another link to

622
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,440
something called the authors

623
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,679
that itf.org which is still in in

624
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:46,960
development

625
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,799
but the intent of that is to put a bunch

626
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,960
of resources in there not just

627
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,840
checklists which

628
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,120
but also

629
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,919
the authoring tools how to do the xml

630
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,600
and you know stuff like that

631
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,760
um you might want to take a look at that

632
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,760
um

633
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,840
ac go ahead

634
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,559
uh

635
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,480
one thing one thing that

636
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,159
i mean this isn't true of all the drafts

637
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,640
but when you get one that doesn't it's

638
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,799
it's kind of uh annoying especially when

639
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,440
it's one from that isn't a routing one

640
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,039
for or for a working group you don't

641
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,039
follow is if you get a draft and it

642
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,279
starts right in

643
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,080
with out saying what problem it solves

644
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,399
and having kind of an overview with

645
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,320
appropriate references to other

646
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,000
documents real early on in the beginning

647
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,520
and i think uh

648
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,200
i think it would be good if every draft

649
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,799
had that i know that's hard to do

650
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,080
because

651
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,880
uh

652
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
i don't know how many i've seen is

653
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,520
you know you have like the abstract

654
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
the abstract repeated

655
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,679
and then they start right into encodings

656
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,840
and then how it works you know and you

657
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,039
kind of have to reverse engineer

658
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,240
uh the

659
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,200
you know

660
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,919
more uh a more detailed overview than

661
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,760
what's in the abstract that's just

662
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,679
that's just one thing that i find

663
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,559
happens sometimes

664
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,960
yeah we do get a lot of comments ac um

665
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,520
yeah around those lines from

666
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,960
reviewers who are

667
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,159
non

668
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,399
only non-routing reviewers but none

669
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,600
as you said people who don't follow a

670
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,279
specific working group

671
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,799
um

672
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,399
because yes i mean sometimes we as

673
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,159
authors assume that everyone knows what

674
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,559
we know and we just write the solution

675
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,120
uh put this bit there and send it right

676
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,120
um and so yes i think that providing

677
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,039
some background

678
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,399
uh would be would be useful

679
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,440
reference is right up front because we

680
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,279
don't i don't expect somebody who's

681
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,000
doing you know most of our uh

682
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,720
most of our documents now are not

683
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,480
something brand new

684
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,279
their enhancements to existing protocols

685
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,640
or

686
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,640
solutions so but just to have the uh

687
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,559
the references right up front so they

688
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,799
could you could look at them before

689
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,880
you could have it in another window so

690
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,760
you could consult it as as need be while

691
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,480
you're reviewing it

692
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,120
great good discussion uh anything else

693
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,799
any anyone want to bring anything else

694
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,480
up before we go into the working group

695
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,880
updates

696
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,360
and uh we're gonna start with babel uh

697
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,840
donald

698
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,840
hi there

699
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,720
uh

700
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,799
i'm donald eastlake uh

701
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,640
one of the chairs of the novel working

702
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,840
group next slide

703
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,159
so it's one of the smaller working

704
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,840
groups perhaps

705
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,760
in terms of uh number of drafts and

706
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,279
things like that

707
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,799
people who aren't familiar with it you

708
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,880
know it's it's distance vector running

709
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,880
protocol but augmented with mechanisms

710
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,840
to avoid the uh void loops or count to

711
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,000
infinity or anything like that and also

712
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,320
to avoid uh starvation

713
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
so it's been proven to be quite

714
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,960
effective in a number of instances

715
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,159
you know it

716
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,159
has various motherhood and apple pie

717
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,760
it's some simple robust that's been

718
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,760
implemented multiple times and opens

719
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,919
multiple open source implementations

720
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,880
seems to be pretty robust uh against uh

721
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,840
embedded to behave networks and uh

722
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,000
some level of routing uh some level

723
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,520
implementation and errors uh extensible

724
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,600
it particularly seems to be effective in

725
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,000
networks where you have at least some

726
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,679
links with unstable metrics these are

727
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,520
typically radio links

728
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,120
uh or

729
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,840
um overlays consisting of uh like

730
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,919
intercontinental overlays with like

731
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,399
zillions of tunnels involved so

732
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,480
that you get the combined instability of

733
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,799
all of these things

734
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,480
has been deployed in a number of cases

735
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,360
and

736
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,559
it was

737
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,440
uh

738
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,120
seems to be effective in small unmanaged

739
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,880
networks also

740
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,120
next slide

741
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,320
not supposed to spend much time on

742
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,679
documents but

743
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,360
people should be aware initially there

744
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,559
were three experimental rfcs documenting

745
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,080
it i was selected as the homenet uh

746
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,240
working group mandatory to implement

747
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,320
routing protocol so it's decided to

748
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,720
standards track it and the the core

749
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,399
standards track documents have all gone

750
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,320
through

751
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,159
89.66 is the the primary one on the

752
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,159
routing protocol there's a couple

753
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,159
security ones on one authentic for

754
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,880
authentication one using dtls for

755
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,120
encryption and authentication a basic

756
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,679
information model is through and uh

757
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,440
source specific extension so you can

758
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,440
have routing that depends on the source

759
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,279
as well as the destination

760
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,840
next slide

761
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,919
so what's going on currently what's

762
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,080
happening there yang data model is

763
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,200
almost through it's in the rfc editor's

764
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,159
queue

765
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,640
and uh work that's really happening

766
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,720
it's been extended so that you can

767
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,640
route ipv6

768
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,760
even with routers that have no

769
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,200
ipv6 address so you can

770
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,360
have the next hop for your ipv4 routes

771
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,480
inside your

772
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,159
your router network be ipv6 addresses

773
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,799
and uh it seems to be pretty nifty it's

774
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,279
draft is currently an ad evaluation

775
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,240
the

776
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,000
most complex question that came up with

777
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,559
that i think was what to do about

778
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,919
uh the need to possibly issue icmps

779
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,320
from a router out of version 4 ipv

780
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,440
version 4 icmps from a router that has

781
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,519
no ipv4 address

782
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,799
and

783
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,880
if there's really no ipv4 address around

784
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,120
that there is uh at least experimentally

785
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,919
one could use the dummy ipv4 address

786
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,679
that actually has been allocated and is

787
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:04,559
in the

788
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,840
iana ipv4 special uses uh ipv4 address

789
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,399
registry which is

790
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:14,640
192.0.0.8. if you're wondering

791
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,519
and

792
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,840
the work which is kind of getting

793
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,679
restarted

794
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,880
is a delay-based metric for

795
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,279
the routing protocol so i used based on

796
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,880
actually are you noticing the file name

797
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,080
there to rtt around trip time

798
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,919
and uh

799
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,480
there is another topic in the charter

800
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,480
which we haven't done any work on

801
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,320
uh which is multicast and it's partly

802
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,279
because

803
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,320
uh the this working group has a uh

804
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,640
informal but very strong policy of of

805
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,760
not even really adopting drafts unless

806
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,840
it's been implemented and deployed

807
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,080
at least limited deployment and shown to

808
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,080
work so there seems to be a little

809
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,039
demand currently for multicast routing

810
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,039
and uh and it hasn't been implemented or

811
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,240
deployed so

812
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,080
really no work has started on that even

813
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,399
though it is an option in the charter

814
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,639
next slide is the last one uh this just

815
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,839
gives a little bit more i already kind

816
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,960
of said what was going on with the ipv4

817
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,879
via ipv6

818
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,320
and uh it's a little more on the

819
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,079
round-trip time you would imagine that

820
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,440
that would be

821
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,599
uh unstable and lead to routing

822
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,079
oscillations and all kinds of things but

823
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,199
as

824
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,119
documented in the draft

825
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,040
which is currently expired but expected

826
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,280
to be reactivated there are various

827
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,719
techniques and

828
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,480
hysteresis and so forth

829
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,320
which have found to be very effective at

830
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,040
damping that and in actual deployment

831
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,639
it's improved uh to work extremely well

832
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,879
so nobody completely understands why it

833
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,239
works so well

834
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,399
and if there's anybody on this call

835
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,199
who's uh has some expertise in

836
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,359
uh dynamic system of stability and uh

837
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,639
things like that

838
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,200
and uh i would like to uh look into this

839
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,280
and perhaps work on a little

840
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,640
section or appendix or whatever in the

841
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,079
protocol that

842
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,520
explores why

843
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,599
these specific

844
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,560
methods

845
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,880
in the draft have been demonstrated to

846
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,400
uh to work so well

847
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,839
the working group would would welcome

848
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:12,960
that

849
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,079
and that's the end of my report

850
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,320
uh chris you have a question

851
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,760
yeah um so having uh had to write a a

852
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,320
comparison draft a while back between

853
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,680
babel and

854
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,200
isis

855
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,320
for home net use i'm curious

856
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,800
how that's gone um

857
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,760
uh have you seen deployment of uh babel

858
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,880
in um

859
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,200
the home net scenarios like in um you

860
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,079
know like uh gateways at the at the home

861
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,680
i i'm not aware of a particularly

862
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,480
widespread deployment there but i

863
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,160
actually haven't been too focused on

864
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,040
that

865
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,560
uh most of the uses involve uh

866
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,640
you know radio meshes uh uh overlays so

867
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,000
uh and uh

868
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,240
uh other uses of that sort there are

869
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,760
people who are i have uh valve running

870
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,880
in their home

871
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,160
um

872
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
how many of them are are

873
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,760
non-implementers available i'm not sure

874
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,640
yeah i haven't seen anything either

875
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,520
um

876
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,240
in terms of deployments

877
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,160
okay

878
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,160
thanks

879
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,480
thank you uh so we're gonna move to mini

880
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,839
um

881
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,839
ronald

882
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,640
ronald i thought i saw you get on but i

883
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,359
don't see you anymore

884
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,359
um

885
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,000
i don't know if ronald is still there i

886
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,599
saw him earlier

887
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,920
ronald yes you're there

888
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,440
we could always move to the next one and

889
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,200
come back

890
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,200
uh it's just gonna mute myself so yeah

891
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,960
we're gonna go forward

892
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,680
i actually i'm gonna skip

893
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,839
to

894
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,760
ivr i got a request

895
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,200
from one of the chairs that they have to

896
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,800
go

897
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,760
where is idr

898
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,320
um and then we're gonna come back

899
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,119
so

900
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,240
okay jeff yeah

901
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,920
hello

902
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,800
uh so at the request of the ads this is

903
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,640
more about the kinds of things we're

904
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,520
doing in idr rather than endlessly of

905
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,119
way too many documents that we all have

906
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,880
to stare at

907
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,920
so

908
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,640
for idr and for bfd we try to keep our

909
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,800
status current in the wiki this is as

910
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,320
much for the fact that we have enough

911
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,880
work going on and we are older and can't

912
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,720
keep things straight that

913
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,280
lets us keep track of it ourselves

914
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,800
so

915
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,480
in terms of interesting work that's been

916
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,320
happening across the idea in the recent

917
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,680
uh couple months

918
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,040
so we've been having a lot of work in

919
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,359
bgb ls extensions bhp link state is

920
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,359
where we advertise uh you know link

921
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,839
state type things across bgp

922
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,680
in a somewhat abstracted way very

923
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,119
helpful for traffic engineering and it's

924
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,200
become very popular for spring

925
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,920
so

926
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,680
uh we've been seeing a lot of sr type

927
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,400
things that have been going in there

928
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
uh the other thing that's been sort of

929
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,720
at the top of uh idea our mind has been

930
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,119
things related to bgp flowspec flowspec

931
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,880
is the feature that allows us to send

932
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,960
effectively firewall components inside

933
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,079
of bgp it's a original use case for us

934
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,200
for

935
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,520
protecting no routers uh across your

936
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,920
network with a common set of firewall

937
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,240
rules distributed the protocol

938
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,920
we had to bust the

939
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,119
base rfc which was originally 5575 to

940
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,599
clear up a number of lingering nits

941
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,079
but part of what the work that we did

942
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,359
there

943
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,560
effectively

944
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,079
gave us consensus on is that the

945
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,920
protocol we can't safely extend the

946
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,440
match conditions that are passed around

947
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,640
in the protocol

948
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,079
the fields are in many cases type value

949
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,800
rather than type length value

950
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,720
this is perhaps a general

951
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,880
lesson for ietf that if you have a

952
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,040
binary serialization of stuff

953
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,400
uh stick the tlv you know that's gonna

954
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,560
be the best answer no matter what

955
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,359
uh

956
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:48,800
this is sort of unfortunate because

957
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,400
there's been a lot of interest over the

958
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,160
last several years about extending flow

959
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,920
spec for various things

960
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,920
and that we have things like flow spec

961
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,359
for uh layer two we have uh full spec

962
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,200
for other you know types of overlay

963
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,720
underlay and tunnel type situations

964
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,839
happening

965
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,599
and we're also seeing that people are

966
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,480
finding

967
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,079
our encodings useful for other things

968
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,560
like psep for example has

969
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,040
i decided to leverage the flowspec uh

970
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,079
nlr encodings for encode for

971
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,000
putting together firewall rules

972
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,839
uh we're also seeing like that net is

973
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,440
having interest in uh making use of it

974
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,319
for their purposes

975
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,960
we're expecting to see that flowspec v2

976
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,800
is going to be there to try to solve

977
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,800
some of these problems uh that initial

978
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,200
work is being kickstarted by

979
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,520
you know sue harris and

980
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,720
donald eastlake so uh

981
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,160
we'll be having some interims on that

982
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,920
hopefully before end of year

983
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,520
and the idea is to try to actually get

984
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,960
that done at a fairly you know quick

985
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,040
pace because the core of the technology

986
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,880
is understood but the

987
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,800
needs for future encodings is uh

988
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,480
necessary

989
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,200
next slide please

990
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,560
so another thing that's of interest is

991
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,560
that we're starting to see a lot of

992
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,040
cross-working group and area bleed over

993
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,000
for

994
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,440
various technologies you know what are

995
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,040
the ones that's impacting rdr

996
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,800
specifically is

997
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,200
a lot of multicast related things

998
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,960
uh the working group chairs for best and

999
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,960
idr are talking about how we can best

1000
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,640
coordinate this sort of things uh with

1001
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,560
some help from the ads the answer is we

1002
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,000
don't know what this really looks like

1003
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,960
we don't have strong process and ietf to

1004
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,960
you know govern this sort of thing so

1005
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,880
i'll be figuring out partially as we go

1006
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,839
along

1007
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,079
uh minimally what we expect to see is

1008
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,160
we'll be building up a manifest of the

1009
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,400
various documents that are interacting

1010
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,319
and then trying to get them tracked in a

1011
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,680
single place where everybody can see

1012
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,160
what's going on and very likely trying

1013
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,400
to find some interesting

1014
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,880
interested parties that want to help

1015
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,280
with the coordinated effort

1016
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,040
another piece of work that we have going

1017
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,200
on is that uh

1018
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,440
we have auto configuration for bgp

1019
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,200
there's been sort of no stumbling around

1020
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,800
for the last couple years we're making

1021
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,560
some steady progress on it

1022
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,880
the design team uh requirements document

1023
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,920
is complete we've been discussing and

1024
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,319
re-reviewing the existing

1025
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,480
proposals for the protocol

1026
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,480
you know based on how they fit into the

1027
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,000
requirements

1028
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,119
there's a good chance we'll have another

1029
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,520
interim before end of year and we're

1030
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,040
probably very close to starting to move

1031
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,680
into the protocol selection phase

1032
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,480
next slide please

1033
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,200
so

1034
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,520
we're also making progress against the

1035
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,359
b2b yang unfortunately part of the

1036
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,680
headache we're running into is that

1037
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,520
over the very strange lifetime of this

1038
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,599
document you know we've effectively

1039
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,839
steadily merged in all of the idr chairs

1040
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,240
along with bahesh and we're all very

1041
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,920
busy on our various other things so we

1042
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,079
haven't made as good as forward progress

1043
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,800
as we would have liked

1044
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,720
now we we do have this being tracked

1045
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,480
largely in mahesh's github

1046
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,319
you know if this were the current day

1047
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:55,520
stuff we'd probably move it over to the

1048
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,119
ietf one but you know this is where it

1049
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,720
currently lives you're welcome to go

1050
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,079
there and look at the issue tracker and

1051
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,359
you know participate with us if you'd

1052
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,880
like

1053
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,640
the work began with the open config

1054
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,240
model and has been steadily getting

1055
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,040
altered uh basically to suit more ietf

1056
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,359
purposes open config is much more

1057
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,599
targeted use cases for the operators

1058
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,599
whereas the ietf agenda is that we have

1059
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,119
to have

1060
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,800
much more broad coverage in terms of

1061
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,880
what components we're willing to service

1062
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,720
and what our extensibility models look

1063
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,480
like

1064
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,839
and the phases of this work you know

1065
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,680
will be familiar anybody has done a very

1066
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,280
large gang module and especially one

1067
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,359
that's interacting with a lot of stuff

1068
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,319
uh

1069
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,839
you know the first phase of just simply

1070
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,760
making sure all the contents in there

1071
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,440
we think that's done

1072
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,960
uh there are certain features that we're

1073
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,640
not intending to put in there you know

1074
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,480
bgp being a

1075
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,480
protocol with many extensions we can't

1076
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,240
put everything in the the core document

1077
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:46,960
but

1078
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,960
you know what's core not core

1079
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,240
is a point of debate depending on the

1080
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,680
vendors

1081
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,920
uh the restructuring and cleanup of the

1082
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,000
structure for the contents and the

1083
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,280
features is largely done as well

1084
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,160
this has been important for things

1085
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,200
you know what we're generally calling

1086
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,319
interwork

1087
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,720
now we have things like policy our

1088
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,000
interactions with the routing config

1089
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,359
module

1090
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,960
the use of components like bfd

1091
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,520
and you know this ties into the sort of

1092
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,960
flip side of things not only we need to

1093
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,400
be able to use all these external

1094
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,200
components the bgp work is going to be

1095
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,599
heavily reused by other things so you

1096
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,560
know our various uh rib modeling a lot

1097
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,920
of our data structure type things like

1098
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,520
extended communities

1099
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,599
all have to be put into structures so

1100
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,040
that they can be imported into other

1101
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,359
modules without a huge amount copy and

1102
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,400
paste

1103
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,839
and we have to be very clear about what

1104
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,599
our ion maintenance looks like for

1105
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,599
things and

1106
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,160
as a particular example maintaining the

1107
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,160
extended community stuff is going to be

1108
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,359
a very interesting challenge

1109
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,359
we're hoping to get this stuff done by

1110
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,200
end of the year you know in terms of the

1111
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,240
full content and then uh hopefully move

1112
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,400
forward to itf uh

1113
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,880
sorry working with last call by spring

1114
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,280
next slide please

1115
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,359
uh that's it that's your last slide for

1116
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,000
idr um

1117
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,560
any questions

1118
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,880
if there are no questions

1119
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,960
do you want to go and take care of bfd

1120
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,400
as long as you're here

1121
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,280
yep as well

1122
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,280
any questions for uh jeff for idr

1123
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,319
okay so let's do bfd

1124
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:27,920
okay

1125
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,640
bfd is both a little bit easier and

1126
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,640
more interesting problem at the end here

1127
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,040
uh the work group is quiet

1128
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,839
you know uh you know greg was uh greg

1129
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,079
mercier was encouraged to take uh the

1130
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,640
bfd protocol and uh taking a plumbing

1131
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,720
that might be interesting for

1132
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,920
non-core use cases for bfd and take it

1133
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,920
off the routing working group and we saw

1134
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,000
the presentation of that i think last

1135
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,119
iatf

1136
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,760
and this means a lot of the

1137
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,760
turn of no new things going to bfd has

1138
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,079
slowed down a little bit

1139
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,000
so we're mostly focusing on driving

1140
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,079
existing work to completion

1141
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,319
we have a document that is uh basically

1142
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:07,520
for

1143
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,800
uh one-sided bfd no example b2b

1144
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,720
or static next hops

1145
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,920
that's hopefully going to be moving off

1146
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,960
to isg publication very shortly

1147
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,520
we have a feature that allows us to

1148
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,319
uh

1149
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,720
leverage bfd echo type procedures

1150
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,560
without actually having bfd present this

1151
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,240
originally came to us by a broadband

1152
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,160
forum and we have some interested people

1153
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,359
that are

1154
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,520
wanting to do a cleaner ietf document

1155
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,760
for this and that will hopefully also

1156
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,560
hit working with last call soon

1157
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,440
there's a feature for bfd

1158
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,680
to send large packets to basically do

1159
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,119
mtu probing

1160
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,839
uh the core protocol was mostly done for

1161
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,359
async mode we've had a request to

1162
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,119
integrate uh some

1163
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,440
echo mode as well so that work still

1164
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,359
needs to happen

1165
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,520
and the last cluster of things that we

1166
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,839
had in the open work was

1167
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,000
we had three features intended to make

1168
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,119
authentication both more usable

1169
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,680
lighter weight faster and some extent

1170
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,399
more secure

1171
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,520
at the moment it's dated on a specific

1172
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,599
feature document uh that needs some help

1173
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,280
from ellen decock who's volunteered to

1174
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,880
help us with uh

1175
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,400
finding some lightweight hashes how we

1176
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,559
can integrate the bfd and once that's

1177
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,079
actually been cleared through and

1178
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,359
probably skip that cluster very quickly

1179
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:26,720
um

1180
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,119
bfd being a plumbing protocol a good

1181
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,800
chunk of what we actually see is work

1182
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,480
that's happening in other working groups

1183
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,800
you know bfd being used for x purpose

1184
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,839
you know and uh the working group exists

1185
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,599
for vfd partially to help with review

1186
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,760
for those other proposals so

1187
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,280
we're expecting to see reviews come in

1188
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,960
sometime you know over the next couple

1189
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,200
months since a lot of these uh

1190
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,960
individual proposals seem to also be

1191
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,839
close to their own working group last

1192
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:54,480
calls next slide please

1193
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,880
uh before we go there uh greg is in the

1194
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,559
queue greg do you want to say something

1195
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,440
about this slide

1196
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,359
i think that there is

1197
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,280
confusion about

1198
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,400
dbf

1199
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,480
being interested in

1200
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,520
this

1201
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,960
echo

1202
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,280
so

1203
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,440
it was discussed as

1204
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,280
as i understand it

1205
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,640
yes it's being mentioned in one of the

1206
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,960
published documents of bbf but

1207
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,880
now it's

1208
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,200
not the case so basically there is no

1209
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,559
interest from bbf in this work

1210
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,040
yeah the impression i have is that bpf

1211
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,400
does not want to be in the business of

1212
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,400
standardizing bfd

1213
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,720
but tr 146 which was the

1214
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,240
very loosely worded proposal they had is

1215
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,400
pretty well implemented as i guess in uh

1216
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,720
you know bbf users so

1217
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,480
having this cleaned up an ietf seems

1218
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,720
like it is a good idea and minimally

1219
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,959
doesn't hurt

1220
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,119
okay greg is no longer the queue

1221
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,319
so the thing that's been keeping

1222
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,839
unfortunately way too many of our lives

1223
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,280
busy uh

1224
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,440
bfd has a yang module that just finished

1225
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,760
rfc well that's yay we actually got that

1226
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,839
done

1227
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,079
being a plumbing protocol you know bfd

1228
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,920
was sort of an interesting position much

1229
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,920
like the routing config module policy

1230
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,079
module a few other modules

1231
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,359
you know we want to make sure that

1232
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:28,720
people can use the features easily

1233
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,559
and the discussion that we've had uh you

1234
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,960
know very back in the early design days

1235
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,559
is we're going to have a

1236
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,599
bfd sorry yang grouping

1237
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,440
that allows us to have a common

1238
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,599
configuration experience for

1239
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,680
bfd that was under the client config

1240
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,119
perms

1241
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,480
and

1242
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,400
this our challenge that we have now with

1243
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,200
being ietf we're intended to be largely

1244
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,440
vendor neutral when we can model things

1245
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,599
in a neutral way we should

1246
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,839
and bfd has two standard ways of being

1247
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:58,960
configured

1248
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,200
first one's a centralized mode where you

1249
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,920
have sort of a protocols bfd session

1250
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,079
where you configured all of your

1251
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,800
sessions your parameters your endpoints

1252
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,040
and at that point you just tell your

1253
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,079
clients you know bfd is enabled for know

1254
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,839
this particular purpose so it's a simple

1255
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,839
binary value

1256
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:18,880
the other common way for doing

1257
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,720
configurations is that the session

1258
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,400
parameters are part of the client

1259
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,440
configuration so in that circumstance

1260
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,160
your bfg configurations maybe for bgp

1261
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,319
and ospf would have them in line in your

1262
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,440
configuration stanza

1263
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,359
the problem that we had

1264
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:36,800
was sort of realized as a very last

1265
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,200
second thing this work was done quite

1266
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,720
some time ago

1267
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,520
the rfc happened and we

1268
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,520
started doing our audit on uh you know

1269
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,240
bgp's use of things see prior slide

1270
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,920
and one of the things that was noted in

1271
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,440
the tree expansion was that uh

1272
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,480
we have the per client uh things and

1273
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,839
being a long time since we actually

1274
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:58,960
worked on it i couldn't remember what we

1275
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,880
actually did so i

1276
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,359
pushed the panic call button off to know

1277
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:06,000
the other documents uh that were

1278
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,040
impacted by the bfd rfc which are

1279
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,599
currently in queue which are ospf

1280
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,240
tim and isis

1281
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,119
and

1282
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,119
after going through the panic

1283
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,000
we did eventually dig up the old

1284
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,480
details of the conversation normally if

1285
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,280
you have this sort of thing

1286
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,200
the original proposal was that we just

1287
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,559
simply allow the

1288
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,040
vendors to do deviations to shut off the

1289
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,240
necessary nodes for client

1290
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,640
configurations

1291
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,839
trouble is no sense that the

1292
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:38,400
conversations happened the desire of

1293
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,240
ietf to do this sort of thing by

1294
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,760
deviations has gone away so we're

1295
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,359
the process of trying to see if we can

1296
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:47,280
actually cleanly patch in you know the

1297
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,160
use of the yang feature

1298
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,520
modality

1299
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,280
and that allows us to sort of cleanly

1300
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,960
support it without requiring an

1301
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,319
individual vendor to ship out a

1302
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,880
deviation set now this is part of the

1303
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,640
netcount protocol you know in terms of

1304
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,400
what features you support

1305
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,280
and

1306
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,760
it's a cleaner way to do things uh what

1307
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,599
this is required is some discussion uh

1308
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,920
among the bfd authors the yang doctors

1309
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,960
and such

1310
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,520
primarily because we would be making a

1311
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,319
change to the published 9127

1312
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:19,920
but it's just gone out the door a few

1313
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,280
you know weeks ago

1314
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,720
uh we're not expecting anybody's

1315
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,119
actually implemented 100 of things

1316
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,880
and the proposal that we're having is

1317
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,720
that uh

1318
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,960
you know just simply add if feature to

1319
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,960
the impact decline configs update 9127

1320
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,720
and no changes are required by the

1321
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,640
impacted modules

1322
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,720
so this has been an interesting lesson

1323
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,240
in uh

1324
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,920
getting this stuff right for cross

1325
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,640
module use is challenging and what the

1326
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,319
maintenance challenges are going to be

1327
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:51,359
didn't intend to push this uh as a test

1328
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,440
case so early in this process but now we

1329
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,280
have there we have it

1330
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,640
and uh

1331
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,720
that said we apologize to all impacted

1332
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,040
modules you know for you know the

1333
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,839
you know

1334
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:05,440
basically shaking the tree so early

1335
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,280
uh thanks jeff we're gonna move back to

1336
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,800
see if ronald

1337
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,760
can

1338
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,000
make it now

1339
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,400
ronald

1340
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,559
i can hear me now

1341
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:21,040
yep we can uh we are sort of running out

1342
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,880
of time so um

1343
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,920
okay

1344
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,920
working groups thanks in that case next

1345
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,920
slide

1346
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,160
so i

1347
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,000
just heard that this is old news you

1348
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,800
already knew that don freddie was my

1349
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,800
co-chair

1350
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,520
so next slide

1351
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,240
um

1352
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,319
the money working group at the moment is

1353
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:57,440
mostly working on

1354
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,920
dlab extensions dynamic link exchange

1355
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,800
protocol extensions

1356
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,720
there's a group of

1357
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,240
internet drafts

1358
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,400
centered around

1359
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,440
flow control uh the

1360
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,000
the modem or radio flow controlling the

1361
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,079
router not the other way around

1362
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,880
this was the original idea but

1363
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,640
the assumption now is that

1364
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,960
the radio links will have lower capacity

1365
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,880
than

1366
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,920
the piece of ethernet between

1367
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,079
routers others and

1368
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,559
modems

1369
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,280
so it's one way

1370
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,359
there is already a sort of excellent

1371
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,880
ex-off

1372
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,920
solution

1373
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,520
documented in rfc 8651

1374
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,359
this one is supposed to be more

1375
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:51,558
sophisticated and

1376
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:55,359
is supposed to not completely stop the

1377
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,920
router from sending uh

1378
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,680
uh packets to the bottom if if it's done

1379
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,760
in a more clever way

1380
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,400
so you can keep a minimum

1381
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,000
flow going

1382
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,280
if you signal in time

1383
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,599
these drafts are currently under

1384
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,600
transport area review

1385
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,119
[Music]

1386
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,720
and

1387
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,960
they should be coming out of that by

1388
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,760
early december

1389
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,960
there has been some discussion on uh

1390
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,000
what

1391
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,520
how this is

1392
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,680
going to be implemented on the

1393
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,839
writer's

1394
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:35,200
side for instance if you have a linux

1395
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,640
based router

1396
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,040
if you can use any of the existing

1397
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,960
queueing disciplines or you would have

1398
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,640
to write a new one

1399
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,280
and if anyone is familiar with that and

1400
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,839
has has

1401
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:50,400
ideas that would be most welcome

1402
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,400
there's one

1403
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,119
one of the spec that's trailing behind

1404
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,480
and that's sort of an alternative to the

1405
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,280
the div surf aware approach

1406
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,200
which is in the uh

1407
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,000
in the drafts currently under uh art

1408
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,040
review

1409
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:11,599
and that's uh where you use the 802

1410
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,760
1q header

1411
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,799
to distinguish flows from one another

1412
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,599
next slide please

1413
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,040
we have some

1414
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,119
individual drafts at the moment from

1415
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,000
heading around three of them

1416
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,760
these are centered on physical layer

1417
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,280
parameters

1418
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,680
there is some discussion on going what

1419
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,760
the router is supposed to be

1420
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,920
doing with that

1421
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,640
whether it actually makes sense

1422
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,000
to provide this information that's a

1423
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,400
discussion that should take place on the

1424
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,319
main list

1425
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:53,520
however

1426
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,079
i think the radio band thing is useful

1427
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,799
in my personal view

1428
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:00,160
um

1429
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,040
i expect working group adoption

1430
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,720
at least of that one maybe also the

1431
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,960
general utilization the radio quality is

1432
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,880
more iffy

1433
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,160
but that's

1434
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,599
largely based on the views of very few

1435
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,960
people and we need to have more reviews

1436
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,280
and that's a general problem getting

1437
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,839
people to uh to review other other

1438
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,359
people's drafts

1439
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:24,839
next slide

1440
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:27,280
please then there are some things that

1441
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,920
uh are on our charter our current

1442
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,079
charter that we should be working on but

1443
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:32,960
that

1444
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,040
network is not actually happening at the

1445
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,079
moment

1446
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,640
one of the uh

1447
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:43,359
uh items is uh multicast managed as a

1448
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:46,319
continuation of the uh

1449
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,319
simplified multicast forwarding work

1450
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:51,520
that has been done in the past

1451
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,599
there's also a charter item on

1452
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,440
management

1453
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,079
of uh manage and how this is different

1454
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,079
from your standard management in the in

1455
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,000
the face of

1456
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,119
frequent

1457
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:07,440
split submerges of your network and

1458
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,359
actually we are eyeing the

1459
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,000
asynchronous management architecture or

1460
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,240
it will have a new name

1461
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,799
but this is being presented

1462
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:19,200
right in the next time slot to the money

1463
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,079
weapon group by edurane

1464
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,119
who has

1465
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,760
sort of invented this

1466
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,799
then we still have a responsibility for

1467
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,839
the maintenance of olazar v2

1468
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:34,640
maybe not everybody knows it but

1469
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,960
in addition to

1470
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,400
isis and ospf there is a third

1471
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,839
standards track

1472
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:44,720
link state protocol in the itf it's

1473
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,799
called osr optimized link states writing

1474
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:52,079
and uh it's for manage of course

1475
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:53,520
and um

1476
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,200
we ran into a

1477
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,799
a practical issue original some uh

1478
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:01,520
large interoperability event

1479
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,440
where there was a problem with

1480
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,720
routers rebooting and then being unable

1481
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,799
to join the network again

1482
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:11,440
there are some ideas on how to

1483
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,680
solve that not by a protocol change but

1484
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,640
by

1485
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,079
some practical guidance on configuration

1486
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,920
and it would be good to write it up

1487
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,200
and furthermore there is a

1488
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,880
back to the app again there is a need or

1489
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,680
perceived need to

1490
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,040
write

1491
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,720
some implements guidance or

1492
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,960
clarification document however the

1493
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,559
people

1494
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:40,880
best place to do this at the moment

1495
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,200
don't have the time right now

1496
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,559
so

1497
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,480
we're looking if somebody else can pick

1498
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,480
this up

1499
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,400
there might be some developer related

1500
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,559
work coming our way from the raw working

1501
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:53,839
group

1502
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:56,880
or or maybe not we will see

1503
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,040
and then there is a

1504
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,119
pet

1505
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,040
subject of mine that's not covered by

1506
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,400
the current charter and that is a

1507
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,799
federation of heterogeneous minds

1508
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,240
next slide please

1509
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,799
thank you ronald we're gonna we're

1510
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,119
pretty much out of time we're gonna skip

1511
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,440
the questions because as ronald said his

1512
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,440
working group is meeting in the next

1513
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,760
slot so please join

1514
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:26,720
um

1515
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,160
we're gonna stay here for another uh

1516
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,760
maybe 10 minutes

1517
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,400
to cover the last two working groups so

1518
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,839
if you guys can please stay that will be

1519
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:36,960
great

1520
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,240
uh dominique go ahead

1521
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,119
hello um so my name is dominic bartel

1522
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,520
and i'm one of the co-chairs of a role

1523
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,559
with

1524
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,760
michael richardson acting as a secretary

1525
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,400
next slide please

1526
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,280
um

1527
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,680
so the royal working group focuses on

1528
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,680
ipv6 routing

1529
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,680
for constrained devices and networks

1530
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,440
we're talking about devices that have

1531
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,720
50k

1532
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,359
of memory and up

1533
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:07,040
so not megabytes

1534
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,880
of ram

1535
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,680
and

1536
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,960
networks such as low power radios with

1537
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,880
data rates in the 100k bits per second

1538
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,319
and up

1539
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:21,680
that could be radios can be also

1540
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,720
power line communication

1541
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,200
wrong oh yeah great thank you

1542
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,400
um

1543
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,319
so that's the kind of networks we're

1544
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,720
interested in and the use cases are

1545
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,640
smart metering smart cities smart

1546
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,079
buildings factory floor automation etc

1547
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:39,440
um

1548
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,760
so basically our

1549
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,000
day-to-day work is to specify maintain

1550
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,960
improve the various flavors of the our

1551
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,359
routing protocol which is called ripple

1552
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:50,720
rpl

1553
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,799
and the working groups we interact with

1554
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:54,720
mostly i would say although it's not

1555
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,880
binary uh are six

1556
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,520
six low l wig in the inter area

1557
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,240
uh about uh

1558
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,440
ipv6

1559
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,680
adaptation for uh low low-power nurse

1560
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,240
networks uh lightweight implementation

1561
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,240
guidance you know profiling protocol

1562
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,799
stacks for implementation on

1563
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,280
constrained devices

1564
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,359
six dish is a

1565
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:21,599
synchronous mesh network of ieee 15.4

1566
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,119
radios

1567
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:27,680
raw animal etc next slide please

1568
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,799
so what we've done over the years

1569
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:37,119
into 2012 was the specification the

1570
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,440
rfc is specifying the

1571
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,000
original version of ripple as a

1572
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,400
distributed proactive distant factor

1573
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,559
routing protocol

1574
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,000
the the protocol is oriented towards the

1575
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,240
dominant traffic flows which is from

1576
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,000
sensors up to

1577
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,839
a collection point

1578
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:56,960
or

1579
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,160
so that's the up direction or down from

1580
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,200
the

1581
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,319
control room to actuators that's a down

1582
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:06,160
direction and so we built a topology

1583
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,440
that's oriented along this major traffic

1584
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,359
and we're trying so

1585
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,280
upward routing is default routing and

1586
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,200
going down we have two flavors when it's

1587
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,160
sauce rotted from the root or in the

1588
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,799
other flavor is hot by hop routing using

1589
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:22,480
routing tables

1590
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,480
we strive to have minimum control

1591
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,880
traffic and we achieve that by several

1592
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,359
means for example if we only do

1593
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:30,400
collection

1594
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,119
uh going up so we don't nodes that don't

1595
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,720
need to be destinations don't even

1596
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,720
advertise themselves in the in the

1597
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,599
topology and also we slow down the

1598
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,799
control traffic it's the topology stable

1599
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:45,039
using a tricular

1600
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,400
algorithm so the the network goes quiet

1601
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,359
if if everything is stable

1602
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:53,520
so that was a base flavor

1603
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,720
of ripple

1604
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,640
then we added multicast we added

1605
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,920
optimize optimized point-to-point

1606
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,440
routing across

1607
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,839
the the dark structure

1608
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,839
you can always reach a destination going

1609
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,760
up the diagon down

1610
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,400
but that might be sub-optimal so we have

1611
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,880
specified one flavor that

1612
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,720
optimal point-to-point routing and we're

1613
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,960
still working on another flavor

1614
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,039
uh we've also looked at compression

1615
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,559
we're still looking at compression of

1616
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:21,119
the routing headers because uh

1617
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:23,119
six slow six lupine provides compression

1618
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:24,720
of the

1619
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,520
headers of the data packets but the

1620
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,400
routing control packets still convey

1621
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,400
prefixes and addresses and we want to

1622
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,640
compress ipv6 addresses that we want to

1623
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,240
compress

1624
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,960
next slide please

1625
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,720
so that was the background and now what

1626
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,559
we're doing is uh

1627
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:44,319
um okay i'll

1628
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:45,200
to be

1629
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,200
safe on time i'll just pick the reactive

1630
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,160
point-to-point uh flavor of ripple using

1631
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,880
an aodv uh algorithm

1632
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,400
um which

1633
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,720
allows to do reactive routing as opposed

1634
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,640
to the proactive

1635
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,720
of the original version

1636
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,520
we are also working on projecting

1637
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,640
routes into the network in

1638
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:11,038
when we have routing tables from a

1639
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:13,039
central uh controller

1640
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:15,760
and that entails adding control messages

1641
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,039
adding options to be able to detect the

1642
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:21,599
radio links that are available to build

1643
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:24,720
a topology that is not aligned

1644
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,680
to the

1645
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,200
dag structure

1646
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,240
next slide please

1647
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:33,599
we have

1648
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:34,839
some other work

1649
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:36,400
ongoing uh

1650
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,400
selecting parents up the dag such that

1651
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,319
they have good properties like they have

1652
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,640
common grandparents

1653
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,920
that allows to set the the path for

1654
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,599
doing packet

1655
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:52,319
replication elimination along parallel

1656
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:54,240
paths to the root

1657
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,079
to add redundancy

1658
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:57,839
and reliability

1659
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,200
and

1660
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,520
okay at the bottom we have two more

1661
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,240
individual submission i'll just keyboard

1662
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,960
in the interest of time i'm done

1663
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,200
thank you

1664
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,920
uh thank you dominic so um

1665
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,720
we are way over um

1666
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,640
ac is up to you and chris if you want to

1667
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,480
go over or if you want to leave this for

1668
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,640
the next atf

1669
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,039
as it's being discussed in the chat

1670
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:58,160
um

1671
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,520
the slides are going to be

1672
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,599
posted anyway since the data tracker if

1673
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:04,960
people want to go take a look at that

1674
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,680
ac i would like to just tell everybody

1675
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,440
about the new flooding thing that we're

1676
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,640
looking at what do you think

1677
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,119
i'll just go through them quickly

1678
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,920
okay next slide

1679
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,119
no no go go go to it i made these

1680
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:28,440
 slides

1681
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,079
this is you know lsr is the merger of

1682
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:34,240
the former ospf and isis groups we

1683
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,920
realized we were doing a lot of common

1684
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,920
uh things together and brought them

1685
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,200
together

1686
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:43,839
uh it's it's ospf v2 and um

1687
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:45,839
which is main which is only for i

1688
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,880
limited to ipv4 and then we got isis

1689
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,039
which is a dual stack protocol we got

1690
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:54,480
ospf v3 which also is a dual spec stack

1691
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,280
protocol and with the uh

1692
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,160
uh extended lsa extensions it's now

1693
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,559
completely extendable you could really

1694
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:05,839
do whatever you want and advertise lsas

1695
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:08,480
at whatever granularity but with

1696
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,119
great flexibility there's a lot of

1697
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:15,200
design uh considerations

1698
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,760
next slide

1699
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:19,279
one of the main things we've been

1700
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:20,960
working on for the last few years is

1701
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,719
segment routing we have it for both the

1702
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:25,759
mpls data stream and the srv6 data

1703
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:27,920
stream it has all the signaling for all

1704
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,158
the different types of sids as well as

1705
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:32,399
how routes are uh

1706
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:34,640
computed with those sets

1707
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,120
we're pretty much done with mpls

1708
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,359
the srv6 we have uh drafts for those the

1709
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:43,520
isis is almost done

1710
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,479
there's some work uh on implementations

1711
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,880
for ospf v3 and it's

1712
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,080
there's

1713
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,560
disagreement it's being held off it but

1714
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,880
hopefully by the next ietf we'll have

1715
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,679
ospfv3 done as well

1716
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:00,239
next slide

1717
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:03,040
flex algorithm this is pretty exciting

1718
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,279
work and uh

1719
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:09,040
it it really allows you to dynamically

1720
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,439
define constraints based on a lot of

1721
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,279
initially it'll be different types of

1722
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:14,640
metrics

1723
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,880
different admin groups in other words

1724
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,158
those are like srlg groups for different

1725
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:22,799
routes so you could effectively

1726
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:26,319
have depending on prefix uh

1727
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,719
multiple planes now what's really nice

1728
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:31,120
about this is you can do different

1729
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:34,319
algorithms for different prefixes yet

1730
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:36,719
you only have to have one for forwarding

1731
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:38,960
play whereas in the past you know some

1732
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,238
of the other things where you're doing

1733
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:42,319
different things in different uh

1734
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,000
for different uh

1735
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,560
topologies like mtr which i'm not saying

1736
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,880
the two are the same but you had you

1737
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,238
know most people implemented with

1738
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:53,439
different fibs and so it's uh

1739
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,679
it's a pretty uh pretty

1740
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:57,840
pretty powerful thing and

1741
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,760
now that we have this we're having

1742
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,800
proposals to add constraints based on

1743
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,800
bandwidth and other constraints so you

1744
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,480
could for different

1745
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,280
as long as you have a different

1746
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,120
endpoint associated with a different

1747
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,199
application you could do

1748
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:17,120
a lot of the stuff they're talking about

1749
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,520
in the apn uh

1750
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,760
discussions for different applications

1751
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,080
it supports both segment routing paths

1752
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,320
and now we have proposals for native

1753
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,760
ipafs

1754
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,480
next slide

1755
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,560
flooding optimizations one thing we

1756
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,280
found is the igps have been very

1757
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,120
redundant in their flooding you flood on

1758
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,640
all interfaces except the one you

1759
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,560
received on basically

1760
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,480
and we decided

1761
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,320
people have had uh there's been

1762
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,679
proprietary extensions to block flooding

1763
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:49,679
on certain interfaces

1764
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:52,320
for years and years uh

1765
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,920
and it's just kind of and there's also

1766
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,320
an isis has had a mesh group

1767
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,960
where you only flood to uh you know you

1768
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,960
don't flood to everybody in the mesh

1769
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:01,760
group

1770
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,679
and now

1771
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,440
everybody realized that you could you

1772
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,280
could have a sparse topology where you

1773
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,199
don't need to flood everybody in the

1774
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:10,239
entire

1775
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:12,880
spt and shortest path tree and and in

1776
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,800
the link state protocols

1777
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,679
so we have uh uh both centralized and

1778
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:21,120
distributed calculation of this of us of

1779
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,199
a sparser flooding tree

1780
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:26,400
and uh that's that's one set you know of

1781
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,239
disseminating which

1782
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:29,280
uh

1783
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,360
you know either the topology or which

1784
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,679
algorithm is being used to calculate the

1785
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:36,080
topology and distributed faction

1786
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:39,040
also we have some proposals for area

1787
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,440
abstraction so that you could take a

1788
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,840
piece of your topology and completely

1789
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,360
abstract it

1790
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:49,920
and there's we're we have ospf ttc ttz

1791
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,080
trent topology transparent zone and

1792
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,480
we're working on we have isis topology

1793
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,159
transfer

1794
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:59,520
parent zone and now we have we also have

1795
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,120
a

1796
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,560
i hate to say it but it seems like a

1797
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,880
more straightforward to do it way to do

1798
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,960
it with area proxy that's a little bit

1799
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,480
simpler

1800
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,840
uh we also have uh you know in bgp many

1801
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,880
you are familiar with the route

1802
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,159
reflector

1803
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:16,320
we have a

1804
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:19,920
proposal to limit the number of uh

1805
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,400
adjacencies over which you have to you

1806
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,800
know establish within an area

1807
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,120
with the sort of like a

1808
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,880
equivalent to a route reflector i mean

1809
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,320
there's a lot of different things when

1810
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,440
you're doing it with a link state

1811
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,880
protocol then with uh bgp but that's

1812
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,280
also some inter very interesting work

1813
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,960
and finally we have flooding speeds

1814
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:43,199
optimization the old iso specs for isis

1815
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:44,400
limited

1816
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,520
severely limited the number of lsps link

1817
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,760
state protocol pdus you could flood over

1818
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,040
an interface

1819
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,360
in a certain and say a second

1820
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,520
and we have uh

1821
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,159
ways of getting feedback both explicit

1822
01:12:58,159 --> 01:12:59,440
feedback

1823
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,280
in the form of protocol encoding and

1824
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,199
feedback from the

1825
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:06,320
network in in in other words how fast

1826
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:10,080
the receiver of the lsps is acting them

1827
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,560
to improve this speed and be able to do

1828
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,480
higher speed bursts and everything and

1829
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,880
and really speed up the protocol for

1830
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,040
some of the bigger domains next slide

1831
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,560
protocol maintenance i'm not going to

1832
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,760
say much

1833
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,760
more here we're just you know there's a

1834
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,920
lot of people want to put things into

1835
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:31,600
the igp's apple at the node

1836
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,000
link and prefix layer

1837
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,239
and we have to decide

1838
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:38,320
basically does this really belong in the

1839
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:42,400
igp igp as an underlay for all the uh

1840
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,520
overlay protocols be it

1841
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:51,280
bgp you know ib gp be it list be it uh

1842
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,840
proprietary protocols that use

1843
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,840
you know use use the igp as underlay

1844
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,920
it's pretty critical that it work well

1845
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:58,800
so

1846
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,120
we we we look at these we look at the

1847
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,679
volume and the frequency that it changes

1848
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:06,000
and we have other ways unfortunately we

1849
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,199
have really we have other ways to do

1850
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:12,080
flooding of non-routing information in

1851
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,440
separating

1852
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,640
instances

1853
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,199
but people aren't we really haven't

1854
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:18,560
gotten those deployed we have the

1855
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,840
standards but not uh deployment

1856
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,000
and finally

1857
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,840
uh we have uh

1858
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,600
i we have

1859
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,360
sometimes

1860
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,440
uh

1861
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,040
a lot of enhancements to the basic

1862
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,040
protocol like there's a there's like for

1863
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,280
instance this isi support for additional

1864
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:40,320
layer additional levels of hierarchy

1865
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,880
right now both ospf and isis support two

1866
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,679
levels you know like effectively a

1867
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:48,400
backbone in non-backbone areas

1868
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,159
but this is for

1869
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:52,719
multiple layers of hierarchy with

1870
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:55,679
the lower level completely subsumed by

1871
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:58,560
the layer above it last slide

1872
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,800
yeah i want to throw in something

1873
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,040
use this opportunity to try to attract

1874
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,440
some attention from other groups

1875
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:09,440
back two slides ago when ac mentioned

1876
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:12,080
the flooding speed optimization

1877
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,400
that's congestion control

1878
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,920
right so people

1879
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,080
interested in congestion control you

1880
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,080
know from over in the transport area

1881
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:23,920
basically tcp right we're trying to get

1882
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,360
max well

1883
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,960
i'd like to see maximal and i think

1884
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,560
other people are trying to get maximal

1885
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:31,280
flooding speed right to maximally use

1886
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,360
these these links to flood so if that's

1887
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,800
interesting to you

1888
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,600
um pop over it's not just igp this is

1889
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,040
kind of some cool

1890
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,560
you know crossover

1891
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,760
stuff

1892
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,159
that's it

1893
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,360
last slide of course we got the la yang

1894
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,400
models

1895
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,040
and as jeff covered in excruciate jeff

1896
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,600
haas covered in excruciating detail

1897
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,840
we're just waiting for this one bfd

1898
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,600
issue to be resolved

1899
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,520
where we didn't want to ship a model

1900
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,440
that would require the predominant

1901
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,600
implementations to have dv to have a

1902
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,480
deviation for every instance of

1903
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,640
bfd uh

1904
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,719
uh configuration

1905
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:12,320
and then we got

1906
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,800
uh we got drafts for all the other

1907
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,400
things we talked about on the previous

1908
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,199
slides for augmentations to the base

1909
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:23,120
ospf and isi seeing models

1910
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,840
and that's it

1911
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,440
i said we didn't lose too many people

1912
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,280
even though it went a little late

1913
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,360
no i am surprised and grateful about

1914
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,679
that grateful for you too as well for

1915
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:36,560
doing this i i i mean i knew jeff didn't

1916
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,640
want to follow us and he had to ask to

1917
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,440
leave early so

1918
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,880
well so we don't delay anyone anymore um

1919
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:45,840
thank you

1920
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,000
and we'll see you hopefully in person

1921
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,520
next time somewhere in europe

1922
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,239
you
