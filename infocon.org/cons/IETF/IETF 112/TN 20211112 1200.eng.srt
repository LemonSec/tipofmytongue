is being recorded by opening your mic or

17
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,720
turning on your camera you are agreeing

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,439
to

19
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:09,910
um

20
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,119
[Music]

21
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,080

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,720
public uh domain and uh will be

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,520
uh displayed on youtube in the future so

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,400
for reference on that there is the um

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,680
i'll come to that on the note well in a

27
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,560
second so our agenda is at this url but

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,479
i will present it as well there is a

29
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,799
participant guide for using meet echo i

30
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,560
know we are all mostly familiar with

31
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,240
this but there may be some new attendees

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,520
who aren't

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,320
if you follow that url there is a

34
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,640
good explanation on how to use meat echo

35
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,960
obviously this is a bit of a catch-22 if

36
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,520
you are listening or hearing me now uh

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,880
that implies you have managed to get

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,200
into me echo in some way

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,040
there's also a way to report technical

40
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,119
issues if you have any

41
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,119
uh so this is the standard ietf note

42
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,360
well this covers

43
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,119
the

44
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,799
code of conduct

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,680
the rules and behaviors the

46
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,038
basic background to the ietf processes

47
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,040
how the ietf works how the working group

48
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,400
works how one is expected to behave what

49
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,480
happens if you have difficulty with the

50
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,640
behavior of other people or you behave

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,080
in a manner that is not seen as

52
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,440
the way the ietf wishes to hold their

53
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,599
proceedings there is also important

54
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,120
information in bcp 78 and bcp 79

55
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,400
concerning ipr copyright patents and how

56
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,959
you participate in the itf if you have

57
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,519
not read these recently i do recommend

58
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,360
you read them including the privacy

59
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,319
policy

60
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,360
um

61
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,519
here's a short summary the chairs can

62
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,879
help if you have questions and we can

63
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,400
forward your questions to members of the

64
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,800
ombuds team if we are unable to help or

65
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,440
you feel that we can't

66
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,360
so the agenda for today's meeting um

67
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,040
we are currently covering the 10-minute

68
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,840
discussion from the chairs about admin

69
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,440
we will then have a 20-minute discussion

70
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,280
about the charter

71
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,640
because as some of you are probably

72
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,760
aware

73
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,280
the working group is completing its

74
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,440
current charter and there has been much

75
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,000
discussion about rechartering

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,360
i know at the last ietf meeting we

77
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,120
discussed proposed text the working

78
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,800
group came up with some proposed text

79
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,120
since then the chairs our ads ahead and

80
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,239
the iesg have been wrangling over uh

81
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,360
various

82
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,480
um

83
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,480
use of various terminology what the isg

84
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,920
would like to see as compared to what

85
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,200
the working group would like to see and

86
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,879
we've got a report from the chairs on

87
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,799
how that progressed

88
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,239
some of you may have read some of that

89
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,560
on the mailing list but there hasn't

90
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,239
been much discussion and this is a good

91
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,400
point for us to give you a summary

92
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,599
um then we will have a couple of

93
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,040
presentations about um

94
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,599
some of the bpv7 type stuff

95
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,640
uh a wireshark desector from brian

96
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,959
um some an update from brian on the cozy

97
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,040
security context work

98
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,920
um

99
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,159
scott burley then has an interesting

100
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,200
presentation about scaling dtm out to

101
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,720
bigger networks

102
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,400
um

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,000
i'll have a comment about that before he

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,079
actually starts but uh having had a

105
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,358
sneak preview of his slides i think

106
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,358
that's interesting he's got a 25-minute

107
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,160
slot because he covers a lot of subjects

108
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,800
um we then have asynchronous management

109
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,840
architecture update from emery which

110
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,440
will be relevant particularly in light

111
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,880
of the

112
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,199
charter updates and the proposed new

113
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,320
charter

114
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,600
and then sarah has a

115
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,120
shortage presentation i'm afraid she's

116
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,880
been a bit squeezed for time

117
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,400
talking about network management in

118
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,919
challenged environments and some tooling

119
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,800
around that we also have a 10 minute

120
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,560
section for any other business in open

121
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,520
mic

122
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,880
so

123
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,160
i think we would prefer to have

124
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,080
discussion about individual topics

125
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,440
squeezed in at the end of each

126
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,240
presentation but if there's general uh

127
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,080
discussion that isn't covered by any of

128
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,440
the presentations that 10 minute slot is

129
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,479
the perfect time for that

130
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,400
so a couple of bits of administrative

131
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,160
yeah the meat ecosystem can struggle

132
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,080
this is not so true anymore it's got

133
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,800
really good in my opinion but uh of

134
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,039
course um if we have lots of

135
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,080
participants um then obviously in the

136
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,720
world of uh streaming video things can

137
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,560
get a bit laggy

138
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,080
particularly if you have a long latency

139
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
link please be patient when turning on

140
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
your mic and before speaking because

141
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,840
there is a round trip time

142
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,000
it's not on the delay tolerance scale

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,720
but it still can be tens to hundreds of

144
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,280
milliseconds so just be patient but in

145
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,479
this

146
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,320
covid era i think we're all a lot more

147
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,600
experienced with video conferencing

148
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,880
systems

149
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,880
more importantly is the minute taking so

150
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,080
uh cody md is the interactive uh

151
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,479
multi-person markdown based editing

152
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,039
system that is built into meet echo i

153
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,240
believe the

154
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,800
relevant button is on the toolbar on the

155
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,039
top right of meat echo

156
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,600
please help contribute to the

157
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,600
note-taking i know adam our secretary is

158
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,160
intending to take uh notes as fast as he

159
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,039
can

160
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,840
please help him out if somebody uh if he

161
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,759
mistypes somebody's name or mistypes

162
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,199
your point it's worth just double

163
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,960
checking particularly if you ask a

164
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,120
question or respond to a question that

165
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,120
that's been captured correctly and also

166
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,240
just help out we're trying to be

167
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,919
collaborative about this

168
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,319
also important information so uh the

169
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,600
mailing list

170
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,880
dtn ietf.org is where the

171
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,280
main procedures of the ietf are actually

172
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,440
handled so that is the

173
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,560
canonical reference for decision making

174
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,360
and the really good place for discussion

175
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,440
on subjects according that the working

176
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,280
group are working on if you wish to

177
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,560
contact the chairs please use the uh dtn

178
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,800
hyphen chairs at iatf.org and that will

179
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,280
get to ed and myself and it also gets to

180
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,400
the ad

181
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,960
so if you've got

182
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,560
administration questions queries about

183
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,360
working group process topics

184
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,039
that's a good place if it's about

185
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,039
technicalities the dtm mailing main

186
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,880
investors the right place to go

187
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,880
we're the chairs not the de facto

188
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,280
experts in this field

189
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,039
um so very quickly document status so

190
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,319
many of you are probably aware that

191
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,400
there have been the big four documents

192
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,360
that we have been desperately waiting to

193
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,280
complete as part of the current charter

194
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,400
cycle they being bundled protocol

195
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,720
version 7 bp sec

196
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,960
a default security context for bp sec

197
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,599
and the tcp based convergence layer

198
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,080
which is tcpcl version 4.

199
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,759
good news they are all at the rfc editor

200
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,720
state that means the rfc edit editorial

201
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,680
team is actively working on

202
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,039
um the documents to make sure the

203
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,599
language is accessible for particularly

204
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,120
for non-native speakers this is an

205
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,240
important part of the rfc editorial

206
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,639
team's objective and also to make sure

207
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,160
the documents are internally consistent

208
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,000
and do all the good work that uh that an

209
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,360
editor does

210
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,960
and they're a good team

211
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,080
so they expect to have completed that

212
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,639
work in the next two weeks according to

213
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,000
the correspondence the chairs have had

214
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,479
with them which is fantastic news

215
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,479
at that point the documents will reach

216
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,520
what's called auth 48 state or 48 for

217
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,280
those who don't know

218
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,958
is the 48 hours the authors have to

219
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,599
respond to the edits that the editor has

220
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,958
made to say yes i approve no i don't

221
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,559
approve

222
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,000
although it's called all 48 states

223
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,839
sometimes it can drag on a little bit

224
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,399
particularly when authors have uh aren't

225
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,760
paying attention because they were

226
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,120
involved at the beginning and not at the

227
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,519
end of a document etc the good news is

228
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,320
the all the authors whose names are on

229
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
those four documents have all already

230
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,720
responded to the chairs to say yes i'm

231
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,880
here the email address is valid and i am

232
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,440
very happy to i am prepared for the auth

233
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,519
48 state and to reply promptly to the

234
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,200
rfc editor which means with luck we

235
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,680
should have four rfcs

236
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,279
before the end of the year that's what

237
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,800
we're really hoping

238
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,480
um and

239
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
if that comes to pass that would be a

240
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,240
fantastic end of year for the working

241
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,360
group and would nicely

242
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,519
close off this charter cycle with four

243
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,519
rfcs and i think we should all be very

244
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,560
pleased to see that happen

245
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,560
so i'm going to hand over to ed's now to

246
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,880
talk about the working group charter in

247
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,399
some detail well i'll cover some of the

248
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,360
later parts but um ed

249
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,120
do take over and shout next when you

250
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,760
want me to change the slides

251
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,560
can you hear me now

252
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,600
how about now yes we can i i turn to my

253
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,480
turn my audio off

254
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,560
someone someone keeps muting me so i

255
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,480
think i think you can hear me now okay

256
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,519
so uh yes now now that we have that hope

257
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,079
of getting four rfcs uh through by the

258
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,680
end of the year the next obvious

259
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,760
question is what next we've talked about

260
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,600
that significantly uh both in the

261
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,560
mailing list and at prior um dtm working

262
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,680
group meetings

263
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,800
and we did propose an initial charter

264
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,640
and that initial charter when it went

265
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,200
through iesg review came back with uh

266
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,440
some excellent comments and then two

267
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,760
comments that were blocking i think it's

268
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,399
important uh we all of the authors of

269
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,040
the four rfcs uh that are coming out of

270
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,399
the editor in the next few weeks

271
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,399
understand what it's like to go through

272
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,560
last call reviews and iesg reviews and

273
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,480
the nature of blocking comments

274
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,560
and they are typically not uh you were

275
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,240
doing something incorrect they are

276
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,480
typically have you thought about this

277
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,040
or will you be sure to review things

278
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,800
with us and that was the nature of the

279
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,760
blocks that we saw for this for our

280
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,240
proposed charter work and the two uh

281
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
blocks that came from different uh areas

282
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,240
were from the ops area related to

283
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,920
network management and from the routing

284
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,519
area uh related to

285
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,320
anything uh associated with routing work

286
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,399
and even uh though when we walk through

287
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,640
our charter in a few slides we make

288
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,480
specific statements about what we want

289
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,200
and don't want to do relative to routing

290
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,040
we want to make sure that we are always

291
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,480
working with the

292
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,279
the appropriate areas and working groups

293
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,040
the important part of this is that rick

294
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,279
and i have negotiated uh this from a

295
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,040
charter perspective we have not

296
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,360
significantly changed the work that we

297
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,440
want to accomplish in this charter but

298
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,959
we have been able to explain how the

299
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,120
work is focused on challenge networks

300
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,360
the blocks have been removed the charter

301
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,000
text has been updated and uh this will

302
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,959
go into the telechat for december 12th

303
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,959
and we uh we are certainly hopeful and

304
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,399
expect that the charter would then be

305
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,279
approved and we are proceeding as if

306
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,000
this will be our charter unless zahed

307
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
says something different

308
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,800
no uh i am just i turn on my audio and

309
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,480
video just to confirm the yes that has

310
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
been the case and this is now from

311
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,200
yesterday on the external review

312
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,440
so that's the next phase and then we'll

313
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,240
see

314
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,440
uh if

315
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,680
how the it approves or not

316
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,920
we might get some comments

317
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,240
that we need to handle it but

318
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,040
yeah we'll see

319
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,560
and by the way all of the comments that

320
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,480
we received blocking or not were were

321
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,240
very good comments and and we did

322
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,079
incorporate and respond to all of them

323
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,000
we didn't turn away any of them or say

324
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,519
that we disagreed with any of them and

325
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,959
that has been the nature of the review

326
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,360
of ietf in general the technical review

327
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,720
that we've gotten through all of this

328
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,040
work is is just terrific and and we are

329
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,880
appreciative of it

330
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,120
so so this is perhaps the right time to

331
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,360
say i mean from iit my

332
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,399
colleagues

333
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,079
other ladies and i have been super

334
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,600
impressed by the work that have been

335
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,519
produced by the dt and working group so

336
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,279
so congratulations and thanks for doing

337
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,920
the really good work i hope to continue

338
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,440
uh this this work um uh in the same same

339
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,399
spirit

340
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,240
um and obviously we have some challenges

341
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,320
like i mean we're sitting in a traps

342
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,560
transport area and we have lots of

343
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,760
things to do

344
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,519
on the ops and other areas but we are

345
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,279
we're very used to with this environment

346
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,560
right so that's not a surprise for us

347
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,160
so let's continue doing the good work

348
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,079
and hopefully the recharger will

349
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,160
complete by the uh

350
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,800
december 12th until this year

351
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,959
absolutely so rick if we go to the next

352
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,240
slide

353
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,320
um if we were to take a step back and

354
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,000
look at the kind of blocking statements

355
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,839
that were on that charter

356
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,600
they they really came down to a common

357
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,160
concern and that is that dtn delay and

358
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,560
disruption tolerant networking touches

359
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,199
lots of topics and not just topics that

360
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,680
are restricted in an ietf sense to the

361
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,279
transport area

362
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,440
to the transport area and so when the

363
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,639
working group starts to address these

364
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,399
other topics like network management and

365
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,160
like routing it's starting to look at

366
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,560
other ietf areas as well

367
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,480
and an observation that we have made

368
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,639
time and time again within the dtn

369
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,279
working group is that yes while network

370
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,360
management ops in general is a different

371
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
area within the ietf and while routing

372
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,320
is a different area within the ietf we

373
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,519
are driven by the fundamental challenges

374
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,360
of our transport layer and the

375
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,199
challenges of our network environment in

376
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,480
which we have to uh exist and therefore

377
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
some of the things that we need to do in

378
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,240
security in network management and

379
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,800
routing and so on will also be driven by

380
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,120
a deep understanding of our transport

381
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,040
which is a little bit different than the

382
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,519
transport that others have for the bulk

383
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,040
of the work in these other working

384
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,600
groups and so you know for that reason

385
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,839
we do think that the work is still

386
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,639
reasonable to perform right here because

387
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,720
this is the community that understands

388
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,399
the challenged environments in which we

389
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,199
would be operating however we do need to

390
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,839
be much more involved with soliciting

391
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,959
good inputs technical review and staying

392
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,120
in touch with and synchronized with all

393
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,399
of the work that is going on in the

394
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,639
other area director of in the other

395
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,600
areas so uh at the end of the charter we

396
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,519
sort of addressed this uh overarching

397
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,880
concern by saying that we will

398
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,560
coordinate with other ietf working

399
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,720
groups particularly we call out security

400
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
routing operation management areas and

401
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,079
we make sure that we're going to get

402
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,839
early peer review while we are

403
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,160
developing uh all of our work as opposed

404
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,399
to waiting until last calls or waiting

405
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,959
until a higher level of you know ietf

406
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,760
wide reviews when at that point a lot of

407
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,600
the the day-to-day technical back and

408
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,759
forth has already been done

409
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,759
and i think that just simply making sure

410
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,199
that we understand that and we

411
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,440
communicate that to the other areas has

412
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,360
gone a long way in making sure that

413
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,040
everyone understands that we are trying

414
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,759
to both satisfy the unique portions of

415
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,240
the environments in which we operate uh

416
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,000
while recognizing the work that's going

417
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,240
on by others so rick if we then go to

418
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,160
the next slide we have a couple slides

419
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,519
on what that means specifically for

420
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,040
operations and management and then a

421
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,959
couple of slides associated with what

422
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,720
that means for routing

423
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,519
so

424
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,600
we in the dtm work group adopted

425
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,959
something called the asynchronous

426
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,440
management architecture it spent a

427
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,759
little bit of time looking at prior work

428
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,800
associated with snmp and netconf and the

429
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,199
network assumptions associated with that

430
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,360
proposed some autonomy models uh and

431
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,160
also some additional ways in which a dtn

432
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,759
would like to manage sort of a local

433
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,839
autonomy and how all of that would work

434
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,680
in a very challenged and disrupted

435
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,720
environment

436
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,199
uh when that document uh adopted by the

437
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,279
working group and went into larger last

438
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,440
call the ops area came back and they

439
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,079
felt that that ama did not really

440
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,720
address recent work uh in netmod and in

441
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,160
other areas to talk about asynchronous

442
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,320
management and asynchronous management

443
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,839
could be rest comp asynchronous

444
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,959
management could be yang push

445
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,480
asynchronous management could be some of

446
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,600
the additional things coming out of

447
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,360
yang1.1

448
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,920
simply titling something asynchronous

449
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,639
does not mean appropriate for dtn or

450
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,040
autonomous or able to operate in a

451
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,959
challenged environment

452
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,000
so simply titling our architecture and

453
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,640
asynchronous management architecture is

454
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,480
is not really focusing on the unique

455
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,720
needs of a challenged environment and

456
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
certainly the operations area asked for

457
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,799
clarification on what what we meant when

458
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,039
we said asynchronous management so to

459
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,439
that end we have decided we absolutely

460
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,039
need to clarify that and so the ama

461
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,160
document will be reissued to be called

462
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,599
something like the delay tolerant

463
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,359
network management architecture or

464
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,559
challenge network management

465
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,559
architecture or something similar so

466
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,000
that we understand it's not just

467
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,080
asynchronous you can have a synchronous

468
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,320
that doesn't solve dtn problems for

469
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,360
example

470
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,559
we're going to make sure that as we

471
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,559
update that architecture we will analyze

472
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,240
the existing asynchronous work that's

473
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,880
coming out of the other operations area

474
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,240
and to make sure that we express the

475
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,160
needs of a challenged environment in

476
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,880
particular to ground it into the unique

477
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,520
uh characteristics of our transport and

478
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,679
then we're going to use this document as

479
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,679
well as both a chance to synchronize

480
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,520
with the other areas and to do a gap

481
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,760
analysis of those existing itf

482
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,679
management protocols against the needs

483
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,320
of dtn my my expectation is that there

484
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,400
are some architectural elements here

485
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,679
that we will add as we learn the work of

486
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,200
some of the other areas and there are

487
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
some things that are probably not going

488
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,440
to change much because they are

489
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,360
well tuned and well thought out for the

490
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,039
environments in which we operate but

491
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,559
that's the work of the working group to

492
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,000
figure out

493
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,160
as we get through that we're going to

494
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,600
then go through another round of

495
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,760
technical review and last call again uh

496
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,600
reaching out to the net net mod

497
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,919
community in the ops area in general and

498
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,840
this will be uh the first of many

499
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
interactions where we get that that

500
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,240
cross area review of the work that we

501
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,600
are doing

502
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,559
uh rick next slide

503
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,600
and then and then so the uh then the

504
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,200
last part is just well what about the

505
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,799
rest of the work we have in addition to

506
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,360
the ama we have application data models

507
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,840
we have asynchronous management protocol

508
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,559
and the seaborne codings thereof so

509
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,120
once we have the architecture complete

510
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,360
once we have that gap analysis complete

511
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,760
once we have incorporated and reviewed

512
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,760
what that looks like elsewhere else

513
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,000
otherwise then we will go back and look

514
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,679
at what is the transport of management

515
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,400
information between devices look like

516
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,559
what are the efficient encodings and do

517
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,760
we already have those efficient

518
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,840
encodings by adopting some of the

519
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,679
existing standards

520
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,200
how do we express the need for

521
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,679
deterministic autonomous operations we

522
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,160
do have some ideas as how all of that

523
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,360
will fit in

524
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,360
uh and and sort of the last thing that i

525
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,960
wanted to make sure becomes very clear

526
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,320
particularly for the folks who've been

527
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,080
working on what we've termed the

528
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,160
asynchronous management architecture for

529
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,320
really a few years now none of this

530
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
stops the fundamental work or the

531
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,400
problem that we're trying to solve which

532
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,919
is simply that

533
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,400
managing things across a highly a

534
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,720
delayed or highly disrupted network is a

535
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,559
difficult problem that is not well

536
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,360
solved yet and we do have unique aspects

537
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,679
to this we may reorganize some of these

538
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,600
documents i personally would like to

539
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,039
rename some of them because i don't

540
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,200
think asynchronous fully covers the

541
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,039
needs of a challenged environment but

542
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,559
once we get through all of that the

543
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,720
actual technical work that's being done

544
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,640
in the problem being solved isn't

545
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,039
changing really all that much at all

546
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,799
and so as we work through this what's

547
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,400
going to happen is we're going to get a

548
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,559
lot of very good technical review and we

549
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,320
will appreciate it and at the end of

550
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
that i think we're going to have a much

551
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
better technical solution that

552
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
integrates much better with tooling

553
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,440
across the ietf and frankly becomes an

554
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,280
awful lot easier to talk

555
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,240
to with other network management experts

556
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,760
because then they can start seeing in

557
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,080
terminology and in architecture and

558
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,720
structure things that make sense uh for

559
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,200
for how terrestrial management is done

560
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,120
or more terrestrial management is done

561
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,440
so that's those are our thoughts on the

562
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,520
management side and then rick why don't

563
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,799
you take it over for routing

564
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,640
i'll turn my mic on um so

565
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,520
the other block really came from the

566
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,679
rooting ads who

567
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,000
had a concern that

568
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,360
um

569
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,960
very similar to the to the concern that

570
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
the ops area had or several of the other

571
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,360
areas had which was uh the routing area

572
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,600
has the experts in routing and and many

573
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,520
many years of uh expertise in solving

574
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,200
and understanding the multiple different

575
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,440
problems that exist within routing and

576
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,880
although there was a good understanding

577
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,760
that dtn's have subtly different uh

578
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,919
challenges when it comes to routing they

579
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,760
really do want to be involved in routing

580
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,080
so as we discussed at itf

581
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,120
at the last ietf routing is explicitly

582
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,640
um out of scope for the next charter for

583
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,400
the for the new charter i'll call it

584
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,159
and the reason for that is is is pretty

585
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,520
simple

586
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,520
we have to be pragmatic and set

587
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,080
ourselves achievable goals um without

588
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,400
naming an addressing framework a concept

589
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,159
for forwarding and neighbour discovery

590
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,600
and all the building blocks that are

591
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,039
required

592
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,240
for routing

593
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,000
we shouldn't go standardizing routing

594
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,679
protocols

595
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,280
because we will have to immediately

596
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,039
update them or discover that

597
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,280
the scaffolding on which they stand is

598
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,360
completely incorrect or

599
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,640
um incomplete uh i i think it's

600
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,000
ill-advised and uh the consensus of the

601
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,720
working group as of the last ietf was

602
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,520
yes we will not tackle rooting

603
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,760
however the chairs did feel that there

604
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,440
was uh

605
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
it was worth having a line in the

606
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,760
charter to explicitly say that because

607
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
routing is such an attractive thing to

608
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,799
look at rooting in dtns is is is a great

609
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,360
subject and is required people do

610
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,039
understand that we need it

611
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,720
we felt it was relevant to have a

612
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,960
section in the charter to say routing is

613
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,480
out of scope

614
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,799
that does not mean that people can't

615
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,799
discuss routing

616
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,320
and routing should definitely be a great

617
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,679
subject for site meetings for

618
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,760
discussion etc but we will not be

619
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,320
adopting working group documents

620
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,720
that are concerned with routing

621
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,440
so even though we had that line in there

622
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,200
the routing ads

623
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,360
worried that that would imply that the

624
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,039
working group was going to do routing at

625
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,039
some point and was going to do routing

626
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,400
in isolation

627
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,640
so

628
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,159
we have had

629
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,320
we have added extra text to make sure

630
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,480
that alongside the statement about

631
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,120
routing is out of scope but also to say

632
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,960
that when routing does fall into scope

633
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,280
it will be done hand in hand with the

634
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,640
routing area

635
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,039
now this may be the case that in two or

636
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,320
three years time when we come to

637
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,600
recharter

638
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,360
that we actually say well perhaps there

639
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,120
should be a dtn routing group as part of

640
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,960
the routing area perhaps there should be

641
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,799
a space-based routing group because i

642
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,480
know there's a lot of interest about leo

643
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,480
satellite swarms

644
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,159
perhaps you know

645
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,080
a working group which looks at space

646
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,159
routing problems that exists within the

647
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:58,960
routing

648
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,120
routing area might be a good idea this

649
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,400
is the future

650
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,960
but what we did want to state was we are

651
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,799
not ignoring routing

652
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,640
when we discuss routing

653
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,720
it's that quite it's really that simple

654
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,240
and by explaining that and making that

655
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,320
clear in the charter the the routing 80

656
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,799
was absolutely fine to lift his block

657
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,200
the other comment made by the rooting ad

658
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,679
was uh the mana working group which is

659
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,600
the mobile ad hoc networking working

660
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,960
group which many of you are very

661
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,360
familiar with which lives inside the

662
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,799
routing area

663
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,919
they have a working group charter item

664
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,559
called uh covering management for mobile

665
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,279
ad hoc networks now they

666
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,400
have currently not got good

667
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,720
working group documents on management

668
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,840
and

669
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,720
also have looked at what uh

670
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,640
this working group is proposing in terms

671
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,240
of um ama

672
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,360
which we should no longer call

673
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,039
asynchronous management but looking at

674
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,520
some of the approaches we're taking for

675
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,200
challenged environment management

676
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,120
particularly for dtns

677
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,760
and they are very interested in what

678
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,720
will read across to the mani challenges

679
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,679
from the dtn challenges and whether

680
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,960
actually they could lean heavily on the

681
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,640
work that's happening in this group

682
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
perhaps

683
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,440
extending or collaborating to make sure

684
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,679
that work has applicability in many or

685
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,400
not so to that end we have also

686
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,919
specified that

687
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,279
we will liaise with the money working

688
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,400
group as we work on some of the

689
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,200
management issues and ed is presenting

690
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,360
in the money working group session three

691
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,159
today so that's uh

692
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,559
three and a half hours from now

693
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,720
and i also happen to know a number of

694
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,120
the participants in dtn also participate

695
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,600
in manet because there's obvious

696
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,520
crossover between the two areas

697
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,320
so

698
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,400
by covering those two points we managed

699
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,919
to lift the block we satisfied alvaro

700
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,320
the um

701
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
routing area a.d who

702
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,240
performed the review and said hold on

703
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,720
i've got issues we satisfied him and we

704
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,480
can move forwards

705
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,400
what's last

706
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,279
so the final piece and this is

707
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,840
really feedback from our our own 80s

708
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,520
ahead which is

709
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,799
at the end of the charter we propose

710
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,559
some milestones and these are the same

711
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,720
milestones we discussed at the last ietf

712
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,919
meeting

713
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,039
really

714
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,200
we need to when the charter is approved

715
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,640
we need to

716
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,320
insert these milestones into the data

717
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,000
tracker to say this is what we're

718
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,159
working on and associated with every

719
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,559
milestone is a date

720
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,240
when do we think we will have

721
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,840
each of these documents ready for

722
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,159
working group adoption we can then try

723
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,679
and predict whether they'll be ready for

724
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,600
when they'll be ready for iesg review

725
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,919
but i understand that is quite a big

726
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,480
guesstimate but

727
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,279
we do need to associate dates with these

728
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,480
milestones so that ed and i as chairs

729
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,919
can get these correctly put into the

730
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,720
data tracker this is um

731
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,080
it's always difficult to estimate how

732
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,640
long it will take to come up with

733
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,080
documents and particularly when the

734
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,840
content is is bleeding edge

735
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,960
however

736
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,279
there is validity in having these dates

737
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,559
because it gives guidance to external

738
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,279
sdos and other organizations who are

739
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,880
watching the progress of this working

740
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,120
group and it gives them

741
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,039
some idea of

742
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,559
what we believe we will achieve

743
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,399
the time scales in which we will achieve

744
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,919
those so

745
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,760
although it sounds a little bit like

746
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,279
we're making work for ourselves by

747
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,720
trying to guess when we're going to do

748
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,559
these things

749
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,600
the benefit of having even a guess of a

750
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,760
date

751
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,399
we would like to achieve by date is

752
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,880
better than having no date at all so

753
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,120
to that end

754
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,520
when people present uh on some of these

755
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,039
subjects and i don't actually think

756
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,240
anyone is presenting on any of these

757
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,320
subjects sorry i'll take that back

758
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,919
there are authors who have personal

759
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,360
drafts which cover some of these

760
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,000
documents and some of these topics and i

761
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,279
know there are people who have stepped

762
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,760
to the mic in previous ietfs to say i am

763
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,080
really interested in working on this

764
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,960
i am really looking to those people to

765
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,440
provide information on the mailing list

766
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,640
to say

767
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,279
yes i want to do it or yes i am doing it

768
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,039
and i think i can have this document

769
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,760
ready for working group adoption i.e

770
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,679
their personal thoughts are down and

771
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,320
concrete and now we're ready for the

772
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,000
working group to decide whether to work

773
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,559
on it if we can get a good estimate of

774
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,399
when those dates are in we can get the

775
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,200
milestones in place and that uh that has

776
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,279
benefits as i've said before

777
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,720
so

778
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
i will the chairs will be taking an

779
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,840
action to send an email on the list to

780
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,679
all the authors of all the current

781
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,600
specifications that are personal drafts

782
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,559
saying

783
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,480
can you guestimate a date please and

784
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,240
then we can get that working if someone

785
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,159
wants to take anything to the mic and

786
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,159
and stay to date here and now that would

787
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,679
be great it saves a round trip of an

788
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,880
email but we do need those dates

789
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,000
that's it on the charter so um just

790
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,919
opening the line to

791
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,399
questions etc i'm quickly jumping back

792
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,080
to

793
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,679
meet echo so i can see if anyone's got

794
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,440
any comments in the chat does anyone

795
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,120
have any

796
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,600
comments

797
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,320
ah so

798
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,600
i just thought i must join the cube if

799
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,159
you raised a question in the chat and

800
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,760
you want to take it to the mic please

801
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,799
feel free

802
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:29,840
go ahead

803
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,679
i've decided i think you were

804
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,080
first or was it a headphone

805
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
yes

806
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,120
okay

807
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,239
i'm interested

808
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,399
uh

809
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,880
i think i think rick and ed has given a

810
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,559
very good summary what happened and i

811
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,399
think we're all now all our like how

812
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,880
things are working now the on the thing

813
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,159
that i just want to mention and i

814
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,320
mentioned in one of my emails saying

815
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,799
getting advisors from other

816
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,039
areas is not out of

817
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,679
uh it's not out of course equation uh so

818
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,159
to say so we can still work on it's very

819
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,480
hard to get somebody to commit to

820
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,720
to come but we can we can try to get

821
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,120
something uh i think i personally

822
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,640
believe like having an advisor from

823
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,360
other

824
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,159
other areas would be very nice but as

825
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,600
perhaps we all know it's very hard to

826
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,399
find someone so if you have contacts

827
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,399
and you know somebody that who can help

828
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,039
us

829
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,880
um maybe that information you can also

830
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,960
provide here or in the mailing list or

831
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,720
to the charter or to me so that we can

832
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,080
reach out to them

833
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,840
uh

834
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,880
that's all

835
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,320
thanks ahead go ahead after sonam

836
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,360
thank you very much for the presentation

837
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,240
uh

838
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,880
regarding using uh our

839
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,600
including routing

840
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,320
routing in this working group

841
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,200
i

842
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,399
actually agree that it's better to do to

843
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,200
do the routing and routing area

844
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,440
but in the same time let's say for this

845
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,279
working group if we

846
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,840
look at our documents after it's

847
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,120
published on its rfc if

848
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,159
the routing is depending on our

849
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,799
documents and our working group you know

850
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,880
it's like there are some

851
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,760
from before the comments are dependent

852
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,600
one document is depending on other

853
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,559
document

854
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,039
so if it's an independent document yeah

855
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,840
it goes for the routing uh

856
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,240
working groups as magnets and some but

857
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,640
let's say if we have our

858
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,080
dtn document which is rfc and it's very

859
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,039
important that some routing protocol is

860
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,640
depending on it

861
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,519
maybe i think the ide may

862
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,600
give us option that we do it in our

863
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,760
working group or we can join with

864
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,480
another working group here so uh

865
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,039
that is like there is some kind of uh

866
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,919
reason why we use it we we need this uh

867
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,159
routing in this area and this working

868
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,760
group okay um

869
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,080
completely understood really that is a

870
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,320
discussion that will happen after the

871
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,200
current after the next charter cycle so

872
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,519
yes very valid point uh i can think of

873
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,519
some counter arguments but that should

874
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,519
be left for i think we've got two years

875
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,279
before we have to have that argument

876
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,360
hopefully by then we will have thousands

877
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,519
of working group participants and having

878
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,120
multiple working groups becomes a

879
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,440
logical organizational step

880
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,399
if

881
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,640
if we you know let's talk about that in

882
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,320
three years but thank you

883
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,159
that that is a valid point

884
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,360
um go ahead james

885
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,760
uh speaking to your question about you

886
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,720
know when do we hope to have some of

887
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,679
these new drafts or uh documents and i'm

888
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:36,640
going to be talking to you all later

889
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,760
about the asynchronous management

890
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,279
architecture or whatever we want to call

891
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,360
it uh my goal would be to try and get

892
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,039
something forward by the next ietf 113.

893
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,000
so i think that sets the the sets the

894
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,519
pace for getting some of these other

895
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,679
documents for administrations and

896
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,600
management that we really need so thank

897
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,840
you because the the ama is a really

898
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,679
critical one in terms of timeline so

899
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,440
that that's really pleasing to hear

900
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,320
thank you

901
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,600
that's actually working group document

902
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,039
anyway but that's great we can have a

903
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,600
solid milestone for that thank you

904
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,279
um

905
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,039
sorry i don't know what the j stands for

906
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,080
but but go ahead

907
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,760
ignacio

908
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,679
you're on mute i'm afraid

909
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:26,709
[Music]

910
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,360
uh well

911
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,440
this is my first time in this working

912
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,799
group but

913
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,760
i am usually working in routing protocol

914
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,200
this is why i'm

915
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,919
doing some question on the chat

916
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,039
but

917
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,440
okay little surprise about your

918
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,480
your

919
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,840
your your talk about that but

920
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,760
now my my concern is because some

921
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,720
working groups like mannet or or bubble

922
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
for instance they are very very

923
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,720
concentrating in a special situation of

924
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,760
routing problems and dtn has

925
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,600
another things

926
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,360
this is just that

927
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,159
and

928
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,040
for instance quality of service if you

929
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,000
decouple it from routing it could be

930
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,399
really very very tricky

931
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,560
i understand that there are a lot of

932
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,359
things to do besides routing and this is

933
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,480
why

934
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,239
you you are trying to

935
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,918
to tackle this this this part firstly

936
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,719
but uh what just to to express this

937
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,239
point of view

938
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,359
well

939
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,520
let's you i completely agree it would be

940
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,760
great to get onto routing and maybe we

941
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,159
should use that as a as a

942
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,879
an inspiration to tackle all the topics

943
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,800
we need to do first as quickly as

944
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,399
possible so we can get on to the

945
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,639
exciting thing about routing and let's

946
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,320
not get sidetracked into a discussion

947
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,800
about where the routing routing

948
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
work happens that's that's really up to

949
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,599
the iesg i think we have people who are

950
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,520
interested in doing it no matter what

951
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,119
the working group name is called and no

952
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,040
matter how it's organized within the itf

953
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,359
that that's actually less important than

954
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,680
than working on the cool technology and

955
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,280
coming up with standards that really

956
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,920
work so thank you

957
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,240
thank you

958
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,359
i think that's the end of that and we're

959
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,720
about five minutes over which is

960
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,760
terrible when the chairs overrun um

961
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,640
so

962
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,440
next up i can't see the agenda anymore

963
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,599
because i'm showing slides um who have

964
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,880
we got first i think we have brian cpos

965
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,720
with administrative record types

966
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,560
brian are you ready to present do you

967
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,920
want to present your slides or do you

968
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,839
want me to present them and

969
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,079
you shout next i'll

970
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,480
i'll share the slides great thank you

971
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,920
then that's a bit easier for me i'll

972
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,079
stop sharing

973
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,079
the mechanism here

974
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,920
i think i need to be approved

975
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,160
oh yes i need to click the green button

976
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,640
how's that

977
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,760
yeah

978
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,280
i'll turn my video off so nobody needs

979
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,160
to watch me anymore

980
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,520
okay

981
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,880
um so this is going to be a short

982
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,160
presentation

983
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,880
um and uh

984
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,160
what this is about is that

985
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,480
as part of some other

986
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,359
related work in the acme working group

987
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,920
there's a need to define a new

988
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,920
administrative record type and if you

989
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,160
look in the iana registry

990
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,960
for

991
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,200
bundle administrative record types they

992
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,720
exist but only for bpv6 and there were a

993
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,520
bunch of tables that as part of bpbis

994
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,880
they were

995
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,280
expanded upon to include a column to

996
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,760
indicate a bundle protocol version

997
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,320
the block types registry and

998
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,240
flags registry and some others

999
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,839
but this wasn't done with the

1000
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,599
administrative record types

1001
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,599
registry subregistry

1002
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,400
and

1003
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,920
so

1004
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,640
what this document is proposing is to

1005
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,240
just do the same

1006
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,839
for this other

1007
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,760
code point registry

1008
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,599
and

1009
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,520
it makes a couple of other changes that

1010
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,760
i'll talk about in the next slide but

1011
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,160
uh it makes an explicit reservation uh

1012
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,359
and it also

1013
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:14,560
makes

1014
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,599
an experimental range reservation too

1015
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,480
and the the experimental range isn't

1016
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,000
necessarily driven by anything other

1017
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,720
than

1018
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,359
they're the large values that uh

1019
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,880
correspond also with the experimental

1020
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,119
reservation that was made in bpv7

1021
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,880
for the other registries

1022
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,880
uh there's no change made to the

1023
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,119
registration procedure here

1024
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,760
it's purely about um

1025
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,240
just marking this as bpp7 and the reason

1026
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,760
why this wasn't

1027
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,880
treated at as a blocking issue for bp

1028
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,119
bis bpv7

1029
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,760
is that the document as it stands is

1030
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,000
self-contained and consistent and

1031
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,520
there's not a problem with it

1032
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,839
it just has an explicit table of

1033
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,200
these are the administrative record

1034
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,079
types

1035
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,240
and that's it so

1036
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,160
an agent isn't told

1037
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,520
that it really should use an iana

1038
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,480
registry

1039
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,280
instead of an explicit table

1040
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,240
so uh on this slide is

1041
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,160
what the changes are

1042
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,720
from this small document and this really

1043
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,240
is the meat of the document is to uh

1044
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,599
make these changes to the inner

1045
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,880
sub-registries

1046
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,800
the bundle protocol version column in

1047
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,359
the left is what's new

1048
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,599
and you can see that

1049
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,839
the reservation

1050
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,599
of code point zero

1051
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,400
and the uh status report

1052
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,200
are already part of bpv7 this is just

1053
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,440
adding this into in a registry

1054
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,400
uh

1055
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,200
the

1056
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,160
code points 3 to 15 are still unassigned

1057
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,839
and then that second table is really

1058
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,280
what's new

1059
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,480
and in bpv6 uh only values up to 15 are

1060
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,880
encodable uh in v7 now we have a whole

1061
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,920
seabor integer range which is 64 64-bit

1062
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,440
but what this registry does is just say

1063
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,160
that

1064
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,839
the 16-bit

1065
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,760
range is assignable and everything above

1066
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,839
16 bits which would be

1067
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,760
4-byte encoding

1068
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,920
is reserved

1069
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,598
and

1070
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,640
currently i'm requesting for the working

1071
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,520
group to adopt a document and the reason

1072
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,920
for this is that um

1073
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,359
as of uh yesterday in the acme

1074
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,480
working group discussion of the the node

1075
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,160
id validation

1076
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,520
they are interested in progressing

1077
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,839
that document into the editor queue

1078
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,240
before the end of the year

1079
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,200
so

1080
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,920
my request is for this to be looked at

1081
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,880
as possibly

1082
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,440
being put into

1083
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,520
iesu review

1084
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,119
in a similar time frame they would end

1085
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,000
up being in a review cluster together

1086
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,599
because they're dependent on each other

1087
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,920
well the acme document is dependent on

1088
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,240
this one

1089
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,280
okay um thanks brian i was gonna my

1090
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,720
first question was are you asking for

1091
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,079
working group adoption but you've

1092
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,920
answered that i think that seems

1093
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,560
perfectly reasonable to me so uh we'll

1094
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,119
do a call on the mailing list um

1095
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,800
for working group adoption i thoroughly

1096
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,240
recommend people have a quick read of

1097
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,160
this this sounds like one of those kind

1098
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:26,960
of

1099
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,480
scaffolding documents that needs to

1100
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,520
exist so i'm really hoping um it's short

1101
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,359
and understandable working group can

1102
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,800
have a quick glance at it we can get it

1103
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,040
adopted and i

1104
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,040
share your desire to move quite fast on

1105
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,560
this

1106
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,880
given its updating registries i miss it

1107
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,640
it should be short sweet and

1108
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,800
non-contentious so

1109
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,200
i i hope that the working group shares

1110
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,040
my my desire to move this fast and we'll

1111
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,040
we'll see what we can do

1112
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,720
yeah the good news is there's only

1113
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,640
actually one requirement in there and

1114
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,319
the only thing that is

1115
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,680
yeah and the only thing that is really

1116
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,920
variable is what is the experimental

1117
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,839
range and i don't have any strong

1118
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,359
feelings on this this is consistent with

1119
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,920
some of the other bpv7 reservations yeah

1120
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,040
okay thanks brian i don't think anyone's

1121
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,200
in the queue to to contend this so do

1122
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,280
you want to go straight on to your next

1123
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,760
presentation which will buy you a little

1124
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,280
bit more time

1125
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,800
yes yep that sounds fine

1126
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,599
and which one was in uh which one did we

1127
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,319
have next i've lost the agenda again i

1128
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:39,760
should just

1129
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,560
too many windows open

1130
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,480
um i think the next one is

1131
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,560
out the sector yeah

1132
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,760
okay

1133
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,560
that should also be short and

1134
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,880
a bit quicker than pop-up windows

1135
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,059
[Music]

1136
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,400
so

1137
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,119
the point of this presentation is just

1138
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,040
a little informational and a little

1139
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,359
public service announcement um

1140
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,760
about some work that was

1141
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,839
uh started under the

1142
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,319
tcpcl uh

1143
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,119
updates uh as proof of concept and as as

1144
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,560
diagnostic tool

1145
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,400
but since then

1146
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,640
has recently transitioned

1147
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,599
to

1148
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,560
the upstream project

1149
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,599
so this started out as tcpcl expanded to

1150
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,920
bpv7 more generally

1151
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,359
and um

1152
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:38,079
later on uh in 2019 to bp sec

1153
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,200
and

1154
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,560
uh

1155
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,720
there is still a repository for doing

1156
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,040
some of these more prototyping things

1157
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,040
like the acme node id validation and the

1158
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,440
cozy context

1159
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,319
but

1160
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,359
the the main dissectors for updates to

1161
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:56,880
tcpcl for bpv7 and bpsec

1162
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,520
made it into the wireshark main branch

1163
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,040
uh

1164
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,520
last month or a couple months ago

1165
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,640
they've been sitting in a queue for a

1166
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,520
while

1167
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,520
new protocols get a little more

1168
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,720
uh rigor in their review

1169
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,920
but they finally got approved and so

1170
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,200
this is good news

1171
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,040
the um

1172
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,520
the way that this was done is uh there

1173
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,240
still is a generic bundled dissector

1174
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,560
which in the past was for versions four

1175
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,400
to six um

1176
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,920
and there's some the version

1177
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,920
introspection that was added so that

1178
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,440
that dissector can

1179
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,880
can detect v7 with the seabor encoding

1180
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,440
and do its own separate dissection so

1181
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,520
the bundle dissectors are separate but

1182
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,599
there there's introspection to be able

1183
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,480
to

1184
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,760
um

1185
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,200
do the same kind of thing that was

1186
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,480
happening already for ipv4 versus v6 and

1187
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,280
and other version introspection kind of

1188
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,839
work

1189
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:57,359
um and uh one of the good things about

1190
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,040
the architecture of how this is done is

1191
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,880
that wireshark has these things called

1192
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,960
dissector tables that let you

1193
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,440
delegate across protocols

1194
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,839
so this is

1195
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:10,078
layering and

1196
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,319
making protocols cohesive but extendable

1197
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,400
in the dissectors so all these things

1198
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,240
listed here are our dissector tables

1199
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,960
meaning that you can experiment

1200
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,520
with plugins to add new

1201
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,680
uh tcpcl extension types to add new

1202
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,680
block types i do admin record types

1203
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,280
the point of this is to to make

1204
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,400
experimentation easier

1205
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,520
and

1206
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,480
uh

1207
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,200
the dissectors for for tcpl and the

1208
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,839
bundle include defragmentation logic

1209
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,000
that's built into wireshark they include

1210
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,160
uh sequence analysis timing and things

1211
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,040
like that

1212
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,800
hopefully to

1213
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,160
make it easier to troubleshoot these

1214
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,760
things

1215
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,119
the one

1216
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,480
change that was lost from the

1217
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,160
original tcpcl

1218
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,319
was

1219
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,800
the ability to opportunistically dissect

1220
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,960
messages if you don't have a contact

1221
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,480
header because that is the contact

1222
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,680
header is where the version is indicated

1223
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,680
and without the contact header

1224
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,160
the rest of the tcp stream you can get

1225
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,480
segments of but

1226
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,839
there's no explicit version indication

1227
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:20,800
and

1228
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,880
so that is i'm going to skip to the next

1229
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,200
slide

1230
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,680
uh that is something that that could be

1231
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,000
uh potentially added in in the future if

1232
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,920
uh there's enough interest in doing it

1233
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,680
uh would have to come up with some logic

1234
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,000
for for how do you do

1235
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,079
uh uh what's the word heuristic

1236
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,839
dissection of does this look like a bp a

1237
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,760
tcp clv4

1238
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,359
header does it look like a v3 header and

1239
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:50,400
so on

1240
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,000
but i have a couple examples in

1241
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,680
screenshots here

1242
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,160
and these examples come straight out of

1243
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,280
unit test

1244
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,040
files that are that are included in the

1245
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,720
upstream source now

1246
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,839
uh and they're really just basic uh

1247
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,280
proof of

1248
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,240
work

1249
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,160
that the thing is doing the right job

1250
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,560
but you can see here in the tcpcl

1251
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,480
dissection

1252
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,280
that

1253
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,920
you can see the the different um

1254
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,760
messages being dissected in the

1255
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,240
different tcp segments

1256
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,000
you see in the bottom

1257
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,319
that um there's some sequence analysis

1258
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,800
of telling you the this acknowledgement

1259
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,720
message is acknowledging

1260
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,520
uh the segment that's in frame number 12

1261
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,880
and it took

1262
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,440
four milliseconds to to

1263
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,440
receive this acknowledgement and so you

1264
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,720
can get some information about the

1265
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,920
performance of

1266
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,640
of the underlying network here

1267
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,720
and hopefully help with uh

1268
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,440
troubleshooting if things are working

1269
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,400
uh

1270
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,240
as you would not expect

1271
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,118
on a real network

1272
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,400
and then on the next slide the bpv7

1273
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,359
focus

1274
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,598
of

1275
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,599
the bundle framing

1276
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,920
all the different blocks and block types

1277
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,920
there's some very basic sequence

1278
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,240
analysis such as

1279
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,720
it it extracts the bundle identity which

1280
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,240
is the source

1281
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,040
uh eid and the time and sequence number

1282
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,119
and then uh there's some

1283
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,359
simple logic about

1284
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,800
um retransmits and uh this is all

1285
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,640
in the

1286
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,880
form of how wireshark already deals with

1287
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,280
all of this stuff to begin with so you

1288
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,520
know re-transmits are not something new

1289
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,359
for bundle protocol

1290
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,800
so there's a bunch of uh ecosystem of ui

1291
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,400
that already exists for dealing with

1292
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,520
these things and

1293
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,000
we're trying to squeeze this into

1294
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,440
to that form

1295
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,800
but you can see that each of those

1296
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,599
canonical blocks

1297
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,040
of the different types use different

1298
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,960
sub dissectors in in those dissector

1299
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,000
tables

1300
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,800
so adding new experimental block types

1301
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,000
um

1302
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,839
to a local plugin outside of the

1303
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,119
wireshark short so you don't need to

1304
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,440
rebuild all of wireshark to exercise the

1305
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,200
plugin

1306
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,839
is pretty straightforward

1307
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,880
uh and then

1308
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,599
as far as uh how this is going to

1309
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,920
continue on in the future

1310
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,720
the base dissector without some bug

1311
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,400
fixes and enhancements

1312
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,599
that were made

1313
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,440
afterwards is

1314
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,920
already in the 3 6 release branch so

1315
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,920
that should be present

1316
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,640
by the 3 6 release

1317
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,079
the tcp cl dissector some enhancements

1318
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,720
to the bpv7

1319
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,640
are likely to be in the 3a release but

1320
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,800
that branch hasn't been created yet

1321
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,079
but this is just a

1322
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,520
rough idea of

1323
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,400
when to look for these things

1324
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,599
and one a couple of notes uh the

1325
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,839
version introspection logic right now

1326
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,160
is a little bit uh ad hoc it's not

1327
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,040
really

1328
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,280
based on on any

1329
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,760
uh documented standard um

1330
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,760
just to mention that there's some

1331
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,920
similar logic that was written up in a

1332
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,359
personal draft uh if there's any value

1333
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,000
in having a standard way of doing this

1334
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,319
introspection of which version do you

1335
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:13,680
try first

1336
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,720
try to look for first which which one

1337
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,200
takes precedence what is a failure mode

1338
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,599
um this could be extracted if there's

1339
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,839
any desire to do so

1340
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,280
um

1341
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,960
like i was saying earlier the the op the

1342
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,599
tcpcl opportunistic message dissection

1343
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,599
could be added it's a similar sort of

1344
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,440
thing of

1345
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,280
just adding some logic of

1346
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,160
uh

1347
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,319
looking at a looking at what might be a

1348
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,880
message header and saying does this look

1349
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,480
close enough to a v3 header does it look

1350
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,839
close enough to a v4 header

1351
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,440
and

1352
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,680
the last point i want to make is that

1353
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,359
now that the main dissectors are in the

1354
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,400
upstream

1355
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,599
project

1356
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,280
that

1357
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,240
it's up to the wireshark project and the

1358
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,760
community around it

1359
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,760
uh to manage these things so

1360
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,720
wireshark has a public issue tracker um

1361
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,280
to identify defects and enhancements

1362
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,119
the normal merge process

1363
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,240
is all there

1364
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,359
and uh

1365
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:14,319
as of uh a recent review uh

1366
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:16,000
i actually did

1367
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,079
find uh an issue

1368
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,200
with the bp sec dissector in uh in some

1369
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,680
circumstances and wrote up uh an issue

1370
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,919
about that

1371
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,480
thanks brian that's that's

1372
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,720
great um i'm in the queue so a little

1373
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,160
personal comment actually no chair

1374
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,839
comment uh if you wanted to write up an

1375
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,920
opportunistic message dissection uh

1376
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,599
draft i think it would make a great

1377
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,520
informational document i mean i suppose

1378
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,599
it's not standardizing anything

1379
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,920
outside the scope of the udpcl

1380
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,160
stuff but a little informational

1381
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,119
document which says if you get get some

1382
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,760
random fragments of uh of the tcpcl

1383
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,359
conversation in order to determine the

1384
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,599
version then you might want to follow

1385
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:02,960
the

1386
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,640
following logical steps i mean if you

1387
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,920
want to write it down that's the kind of

1388
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,480
thing that that is in the next charter

1389
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,000
as a kind of

1390
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,920
operational experience thing and

1391
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,359
informational would be the right way to

1392
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,440
go if you want to do the work

1393
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,319
otherwise this is great it's

1394
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,960
i kind of from a personal opinion having

1395
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,720
your protocol

1396
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,960
in wireshark mainline kind of means

1397
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,720
you're now a grown-up proper protocol

1398
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,640
because why not

1399
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,599
so

1400
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,359
which is credit to the workshop for

1401
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,599
their for their penetration of their

1402
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,760
their tool but um yeah this is really

1403
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,400
cool thank you

1404
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,839
okay and that was my time

1405
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,240
more in the queue

1406
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,520
uh you can go ahead to head if you want

1407
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,800
sorry i muted myself before saying go

1408
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,440
heads ahead

1409
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,359
uh this is very good information i think

1410
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,559
i i like the presentation and i like the

1411
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,079
let you know of the possibility how to

1412
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:15,200
do this use this kind of worship tools

1413
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,680
right for this kind of use case but uh

1414
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,079
rick i was thinking of

1415
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,319
the information perhaps very truly

1416
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:26,559
specific or something could be uh

1417
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,599
you could use as a supporting document

1418
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:31,119
rather than

1419
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:33,200
informational like because of the

1420
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,200
process right so we can we have the

1421
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,520
weekly and other things that we can put

1422
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,960
out this kind of information

1423
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,119
yeah it was a

1424
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,040
big long process of having informational

1425
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,119
document but if we have a lot of things

1426
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,040
like this that we're going to bundle

1427
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:49,920
together

1428
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,839
into some sort of document information

1429
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,119
document that

1430
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,000
uh

1431
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,520
that could be a good thing so this is an

1432
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,599
uh proposal like these are options we

1433
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,480
have we don't need to decide now but

1434
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,559
yeah i i would disagree with you because

1435
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,559
uh yeah i take your point that if this

1436
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,960
is how to do it in wireshark that's not

1437
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,000
appropriate

1438
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
but i can see

1439
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,720
an informational document that describes

1440
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,680
a reliable way to detect the version of

1441
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,800
fragments of a tcpcl conversation being

1442
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,200
useful for people implementing firewall

1443
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,680
filters

1444
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,200
this kind of the standard traffic

1445
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,319
policing

1446
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,960
stuff as well as tooling

1447
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,160
having a

1448
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,920
uh the dtn working group um states

1449
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,520
informationally that this is a preferred

1450
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,559
way of detecting a tcpcl version from

1451
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,480
fragments i see that as a generic

1452
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,400
document but let's take that offline but

1453
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,400
yeah but but then then i agree with you

1454
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,640
then i agree with it i was i was

1455
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,000
thinking like your comment was more

1456
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,240
towards this kind of tooling and thing

1457
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,400
but if we have this kind of information

1458
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,800
use for a lot of other things

1459
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,480
and kind of like best practices that we

1460
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,240
are describing so that's a very welcome

1461
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,160
document i would say mm-hmm

1462
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,280
okay cool

1463
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,680
thanks ed um brian i think you're up

1464
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,839
again i think you you you were getting

1465
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,440
you out of the way at the beginning so

1466
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,520
to speak yeah so

1467
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,599
if you want to go straight ahead

1468
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,760
i will

1469
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,880
this next presentation also is uh pretty

1470
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,880
short

1471
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,760
and it's really a re-statement of some

1472
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,200
earlier uh

1473
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,800
work that was presented at an earlier

1474
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:32,000
itf uh related to cozy security um

1475
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,440
the the background is really the same

1476
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,319
here i'll restate this just for anybody

1477
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:37,440
unfamiliar

1478
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,760
that um the bpsec default security

1479
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,640
context that as it as rick and ed had

1480
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,559
mentioned is going through

1481
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,160
the editor's cue now

1482
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,000
is absolutely usable

1483
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,880
and

1484
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,720
it does what it is supposed to be doing

1485
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,160
but it is intentionally limited in scope

1486
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,280
it has a

1487
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,359
small number of symmetric encryption and

1488
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,920
mac algorithms

1489
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,440
it defines some aad to bind to a bundle

1490
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,880
and to a block

1491
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,720
but it's missing things like explicit

1492
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,960
key identifiers so doing something like

1493
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,319
key rotation

1494
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,079
becomes a challenging

1495
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,440
activity

1496
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,280
and for internet facing nodes

1497
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,480
there

1498
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,040
really is a need for for pki uh

1499
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,400
integrated security and this was

1500
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,079
something that the the

1501
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,440
security uh area uh review of the bb sec

1502
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,839
came up with and um from their

1503
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:32,480
perspective uh pkis is really important

1504
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,359
for internet facing scalability

1505
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:36,640
and

1506
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,760
the main thing is we don't want to have

1507
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,559
to reinvent the wheel

1508
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,720
bpsec provides a great

1509
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,960
framework in which

1510
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,359
security information can be

1511
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,119
included in a bundle

1512
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:50,319
and

1513
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,079
the cozy the cbor object signing

1514
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,280
encryption

1515
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,440
already has a syntax and it really fits

1516
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,799
well into the

1517
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,799
i'll say asynchronous

1518
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:04,240
self-contained

1519
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,079
type of

1520
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,599
environment that bundles exist in

1521
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,839
and it already provides a wealth of

1522
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:13,359
extension points

1523
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:14,960
for for

1524
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,160
future security algorithms

1525
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:19,599
so uh

1526
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,200
the idea here is that this is not

1527
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,720
proposing to alter anything that's

1528
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,759
already in bpsec

1529
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:27,119
it

1530
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,839
is intended on handling

1531
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:33,440
symmetric key and pki algorithms in a

1532
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,400
way

1533
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,119
uh that is already standard all these

1534
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,799
things are already standardized and

1535
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:41,119
already exist out of the cozy working

1536
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,359
group and

1537
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,520
an important thing here is that because

1538
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,240
this is embedding a cozy message uh

1539
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,839
proper uh

1540
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,760
by using this you get all of the

1541
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,720
benefits of whatever comes out of

1542
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,240
the future of the cozy working group and

1543
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,680
that includes

1544
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,079
more optimized

1545
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,799
algorithms related to signatures

1546
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:05,040
potentially they're working on post

1547
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,640
quantum and

1548
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,000
other types of

1549
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,440
future algorithms

1550
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,960
and

1551
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,680
the idea is to to take that benefit when

1552
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,480
it comes down the line

1553
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,119
and the other thing is that this is not

1554
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:20,559
just about the on the wiring coding but

1555
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:22,720
this is also about

1556
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,880
library and tool support

1557
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,200
for cozy there already are a number of

1558
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,640
libraries and a number of languages that

1559
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,240
handle cozy

1560
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,480
and it's made to be small it's made to

1561
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,880
be used in iot tech devices so it's not

1562
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,960
done in a way that's burdensome to the

1563
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,720
system

1564
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,799
uh a little bit about the proposed

1565
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,119
context that

1566
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,000
there's one code point uh currently that

1567
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,160
would be allocated and

1568
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,000
the same code point has the exact same

1569
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,280
semantics between bib and bcb in that

1570
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,400
the security result is a cozy message

1571
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,359
and then

1572
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:00,960
there are

1573
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,559
logics about

1574
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,240
in a bib

1575
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,040
the type of cozy message that should be

1576
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,520
present is either a a mac or a signature

1577
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,440
and a bcb it should be an encryption

1578
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,119
message

1579
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,079
and then

1580
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:16,079
there are some parameter types defined

1581
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,799
that use aad scope exactly the same as

1582
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,720
the default security context and this

1583
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,119
could be even simplified to say just do

1584
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:26,160
what the default security context does

1585
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,880
that's a potential edit

1586
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,240
deduplication is a big thing cozy allows

1587
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,079
you to

1588
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,200
include a lot of details in

1589
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,480
each message but presumably if i'm a

1590
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,240
security source i'm going to be adding

1591
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,599
in

1592
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:44,559
um

1593
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,000
multiple signatures i want to assign

1594
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,200
several different blocks at the same

1595
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,000
time

1596
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,640
and so this provides a mechanism to

1597
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,280
to extract out duplicated cozy headers

1598
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,400
and just put them all in one place

1599
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,359
and then

1600
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,280
the the bpsec results is really where

1601
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,799
the cozy messages end up going into

1602
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:04,400
uh and and one of the things that you

1603
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,440
can get

1604
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,400
uh out of the box off the shelf in a

1605
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,680
sense is

1606
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,240
um all of these mechanisms for handling

1607
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,599
uh public keys for handling uh x 509

1608
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,960
certificates uh a lot of

1609
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,000
uh more complex

1610
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,480
activities can be already accommodated

1611
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,160
in this kind of uh messaging

1612
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,440
and

1613
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,359
so the the the message tags that already

1614
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,280
existing that are already in use by

1615
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,480
libraries

1616
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,400
is proposed to be used as result type

1617
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,160
codes so it's not inventing new

1618
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,480
registries for these things

1619
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,160
and um

1620
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,880
the idea is that this document defines a

1621
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,520
i'll show it on the next slide i believe

1622
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,079
but uh a minimal set of interoperability

1623
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,880
requirements because cosy as itself is a

1624
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,960
is a framework for embedding security

1625
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,480
information

1626
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,040
and the idea here is to say i'm going to

1627
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,559
skip to it right now

1628
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,640
that um

1629
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,920
these are

1630
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,520
the the minimum of of how you do cozy

1631
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,040
uh when it's embedded in bpsec

1632
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,280
so there's there's a set of symmetric

1633
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,480
algorithms and then the the main benefit

1634
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,000
of this

1635
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,400
context uh beyond the existing default

1636
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,079
security context is to be able to do

1637
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,319
things like

1638
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:27,040
the

1639
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,839
identified key wrap to be able to use

1640
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:31,119
off the shelf

1641
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,359
elliptic curve edwards curve rsa signing

1642
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:36,160
today um there's ongoing work in the

1643
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,000
cozy working group

1644
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,960
to add

1645
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,440
other variations other optimizations but

1646
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,319
this is supposed to be

1647
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:45,760
the the

1648
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,799
minimum of if you want to do

1649
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:50,559
p kicks

1650
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,520
but here's how you do it

1651
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,160
and then uh last slide is just

1652
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,000
to say that this exists as a personal

1653
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,520
draft now

1654
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,079
it should be pretty self-consistent but

1655
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,280
this is just offering it up as

1656
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,280
a potential adoption

1657
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,400
to be able to get the benefit of

1658
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,880
pki and p kicks

1659
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,359
in bp sec in a very short amount of time

1660
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:20,559
and uh

1661
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:22,559
the proposal also is that this would be

1662
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,960
using the exact same uh certificate

1663
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,799
profile the exact same mechanisms all of

1664
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:28,480
the stuff that's already defined for

1665
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,119
tcpcl for using this within tls it's

1666
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,000
saying

1667
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
you can keep all that and now you can

1668
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,440
use it within a bundle

1669
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,200
and there are still some open questions

1670
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,200
about technical details

1671
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,200
but um

1672
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:49,200
those if it's adopted can be worked out

1673
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,839
and that's all i have for this

1674
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,200
hey um

1675
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,839
brian thank you uh very much and then uh

1676
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:04,640
just me and the queue with my chair hat

1677
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,520
off

1678
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,680
uh i just wanted to say i i love this

1679
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,400
work uh when we were building uh bp sec

1680
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,640
and the concept of security context in

1681
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,839
the working group uh it was uh clear

1682
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:18,640
that uh defining frameworks like this

1683
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,880
are are you know sort of part and parcel

1684
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,680
of how contacts are likely going to work

1685
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,799
and

1686
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:26,880
having something like this

1687
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,400
is far better

1688
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:33,200
than a bpv7 user saying instead i will

1689
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,799
just produce cozy encoded uh work as

1690
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,680
payload and then not have a good answer

1691
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,599
for that for individual

1692
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:44,160
extension blocks as well so i i think

1693
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,400
that your approach here is

1694
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,880
correct uh i think that it's something

1695
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,799
that's needed and

1696
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:52,079
hopefully that's something that we can

1697
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:54,160
get in and get the technical review on

1698
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,240
and work any additional uh technical

1699
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,839
things

1700
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:01,640
but good work thank you

1701
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:04,559
yeah same uh rick here uh with my chair

1702
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:07,359
hat on um yeah brian this is this is

1703
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:08,799
good stuff and i'm agreeing with

1704
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,319
everything ed just said

1705
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,079
so are you asking for working group

1706
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,240
adoption because as i

1707
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,559
read the new charter hopefully official

1708
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:19,599
new charter this is in scope this is

1709
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:22,079
enhancements to bp sec so my question is

1710
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,520
do you want to adopt but do you want to

1711
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,359
ask for adoption in this group or do you

1712
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:27,760
want to ask for adoption in cosi i think

1713
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,200
this group but i'm interested in your

1714
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,480
answer

1715
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,720
uh yes so

1716
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,599
it is ready i believe for for adoption

1717
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:38,400
uh it would be a dtn document because

1718
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,880
it's it's really it's registering

1719
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,640
things in the dtn um

1720
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,280
ayana section and for the dtn purposes

1721
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,000
uh and there would be what there hasn't

1722
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,200
been yet and would would be is i would

1723
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,559
invite

1724
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,640
members from cozy working group to look

1725
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,760
at this and say does this look

1726
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,680
the way it ought to look

1727
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,839
so this chimes with the various iesg

1728
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,680
review about our charter about liaising

1729
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,039
with other working groups and this is a

1730
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:08,559
classic example of where we need to go

1731
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:11,599
to cosy and say double check this and so

1732
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:14,160
if we working group adopt this uh prior

1733
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,960
to last call we will get a review from

1734
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,480
experts in cosi to make sure we're doing

1735
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,480
it right as they understand it so yeah

1736
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,559
that makes sense so we'll do a working

1737
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,559
group adoption call on the list and as

1738
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:27,039
part of that adoption call um i will

1739
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:29,280
obviously be asking you for a date

1740
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,200
for uh when you think it it'll how long

1741
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,359
it'll take to turn around but um but

1742
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:34,480
there we go

1743
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,760
uh so

1744
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,680
thanks brian i think that's all your

1745
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,400
slot and next up we have

1746
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,599
scott

1747
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,039
who is

1748
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:44,960
discussing what was originally called

1749
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,839
big dtn but is now called um the

1750
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:49,839
scalability issues in big detains hello

1751
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:50,880
scott

1752
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,799
do you want to present your own slides

1753
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:55,599
or if you've got them why don't you go

1754
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:58,880
ahead and present them okay no worries

1755
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,480
give me two seconds to

1756
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,400
do the share screen thing

1757
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,799
leave the queue

1758
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,599
can you see those

1759
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:13,280
uh i see it

1760
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,760
excellent right i will mute myself and

1761
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,039
just shout next when you want the next

1762
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:18,160
slide

1763
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:18,960
okay

1764
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,799
uh all right then let's uh go ahead to

1765
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:22,799
the next slide

1766
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:23,520
uh

1767
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,480
the

1768
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,440
this presentation is uh really um

1769
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,240
talking about a a proof of concept um

1770
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,000
that i think is a useful proof of

1771
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,920
concept to

1772
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,400
keep in the backs of our minds as we go

1773
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,319
forward with

1774
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:40,319
the updated charter

1775
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:42,720
uh the motivation is

1776
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,480
uh for for some time now we've been

1777
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,480
thinking that um

1778
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,359
uh dtn really needs to

1779
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,119
find its way into commercial products in

1780
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:53,200
order to

1781
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,359
be

1782
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,319
viable on a on a large scale

1783
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:00,720
for for example the u.s space program

1784
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,880
and and and the

1785
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,799
space exploration in general

1786
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:05,839
and

1787
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:06,799
the

1788
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:09,680
uh what i'll hypothesize here is that

1789
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,599
that

1790
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:12,960
the commercial products that we're

1791
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,079
looking for

1792
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,559
uh will be unlikely to emerge until

1793
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:18,480
there's potentially a large market for

1794
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,640
dtm products and and

1795
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,480
that in turn

1796
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,559
i think

1797
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:26,960
makes it necessary to to

1798
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,680
demonstrate that it's possible for a dtn

1799
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,160
based network to grow to an arbitrary

1800
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,920
size which has not been done

1801
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,880
in the past we we

1802
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:42,240
we do lots of uh demonstrations using uh

1803
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,599
small

1804
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:46,319
networks that uh

1805
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,319
instantiate particular

1806
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:49,920
routing or or

1807
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,359
forwarding or

1808
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:53,839
or reliability

1809
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:54,799
issues

1810
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:56,480
but

1811
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,240
we haven't really demonstrated

1812
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,520
operation of very large network that

1813
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,480
would make

1814
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,000
uh commercial product development uh

1815
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
attractive so

1816
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,920
the intent here is to

1817
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,160
demonstrate that that

1818
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,680
this sort of thing

1819
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,240
is possible and to encourage

1820
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,079
the development of

1821
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:20,319
commercial products thereby so next

1822
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:22,960
slide would be

1823
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,680
so

1824
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,440
what is it about do you think that that

1825
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,880
makes it difficult to make it large and

1826
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,520
there isn't really anything uh intrinsic

1827
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,680
in bundle protocol or bpsec that limits

1828
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,559
the size of a dtm based network there is

1829
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,720
a second order problem i think which is

1830
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:39,760
that

1831
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,960
as we've

1832
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,119
experienced in

1833
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:44,480
deployment

1834
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,720
experiments and and demonstrations over

1835
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,280
the past few years it's uh

1836
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,119
you can you can readily

1837
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:54,240
uh configure dtn implementations to

1838
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,839
support a very wide range of

1839
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:57,839
communication scenarios but that

1840
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,839
configurability there's a lot of knobs

1841
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:02,480
and so the deployment and management of

1842
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,480
d10 nodes uh is somewhat labor-intensive

1843
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,079
and that that sort of inhibits the

1844
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:12,319
anyone's ability to operate a very large

1845
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:13,280
network

1846
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,160
uh next slide

1847
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,920
so uh the solution that is proposed in

1848
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,319
this presentation is that we can solve

1849
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,719
this by automating some of the routine

1850
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:29,679
tasks of uh managing the network in in

1851
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:32,319
in two ways in particular first

1852
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:34,479
the the forwarding decisions the

1853
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:36,479
management of forwarding decisions how

1854
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,359
do you do that across

1855
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:40,479
a network

1856
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:43,439
uh comprising thousands or millions of

1857
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:45,439
nodes as opposed to

1858
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,120
forwarding nodes

1859
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,920
uh and then uh second and and i think

1860
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,080
less challenging is how do you automate

1861
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,080
the deployment of new nodes

1862
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,759
and uh

1863
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:58,479
and do that in a scalable way

1864
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:00,000
uh the

1865
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,719
the the two approaches uh discussed in

1866
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:04,719
this presentation are uh

1867
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:07,679
to address these these these two general

1868
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,080
kinds of problems first of all

1869
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,279
uh

1870
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:12,719
a concept of

1871
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:16,719
regions uh that i'll explain in a moment

1872
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,000
that

1873
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,600
decompose

1874
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,399
a large network into

1875
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:24,719
chunks of

1876
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,880
limited forwarding scope and and

1877
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,158
therefore limited

1878
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:30,238
uh management challenge

1879
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:34,319
and there's a a mechanism for this uh

1880
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:36,158
tentatively called inter-regional

1881
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:39,198
forwarding that is uh presented here

1882
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:41,600
uh second uh

1883
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,600
uh is something that

1884
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,839
i've been sort of

1885
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,238
wishing for for a long time our auto

1886
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:51,040
configuration mechanisms that makes it

1887
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,439
uh very straightforward to

1888
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,520
create a new

1889
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:59,120
a new dtn node without having to

1890
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,760
go through a large

1891
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,640
network management and configuration

1892
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,640
effort and

1893
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,679
this

1894
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:10,239
v10 node auto configuration

1895
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,239
system is intended to

1896
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:14,239
demonstrate the best possible

1897
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:17,480
next slide

1898
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:22,560
so uh interregional forwarding uh

1899
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,520
the

1900
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,320
the reasoning behind this design is

1901
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:29,600
first of all assuming that that

1902
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,440
the light tolerant routing

1903
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,320
mechanisms really merge over time that

1904
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:38,080
enable the automation of forwarding uh

1905
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,719
among limited numbers of gtn nodes and

1906
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:44,159
the contact graph writing that supports

1907
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:45,679
g10 that's currently running on the

1908
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:47,600
international space station is a i think

1909
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,600
an existence proof of that that there

1910
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,880
are

1911
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,080
it is possible to to uh develop these

1912
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:57,440
things and and and operate

1913
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,600
deploy and operate them

1914
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,960
so

1915
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,640
given that assumption

1916
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,760
uh

1917
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,840
what we're doing here is defining

1918
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,480
the term region to be a set of nodes

1919
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:09,280
that

1920
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,360
is encompassed by a single

1921
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,760
routing regime

1922
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,360
powered by one of

1923
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,400
these mechanisms

1924
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,920
and and for example

1925
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,080
the set of all nodes that are cited in

1926
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,320
any of the contacts of a

1927
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,840
contact plan it would be a cgr

1928
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,920
based region

1929
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,320
regions if you look at them a little bit

1930
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,920
sideways look a little bit like

1931
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,800
autonomous systems you can use them not

1932
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,280
only as

1933
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,600
domains within which

1934
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,920
uh forwarding is

1935
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,920
is coherent but also

1936
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:51,000
domain so in which uh administration is

1937
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,880
located or

1938
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,920
or security is standardized

1939
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,480
next slide

1940
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,040
okay so

1941
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,640
given that concept how do you forward

1942
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,719
from a node that is a member of one

1943
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:08,159
region to a node that's a member of

1944
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:09,440
another region

1945
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,560
without

1946
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,719
propagating enormous

1947
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:14,400
volumes of information across the

1948
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,440
network

1949
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,520
and the interregional forwarding

1950
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,400
strategy discussed here is to use

1951
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,199
uh the the first bundle that's destined

1952
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:26,080
for a given remote node from from a

1953
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:29,199
source node as a sort of probe

1954
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,360
that uh you don't really know

1955
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,920
necessarily what other region

1956
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,320
uh your destination uh node is in

1957
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:43,520
so uh we send out a a probe bundle that

1958
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,120
essentially finds it

1959
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:45,920
and

1960
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,920
there are positive and negative

1961
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,320
feedback messages from candidate

1962
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,320
forwarding points that propagate back to

1963
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,480
the source so that

1964
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,000
once the

1965
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,560
the feedback has been received back to

1966
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,320
the source node

1967
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,080
subsequent bundles that are sent to that

1968
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,480
same destination node can go

1969
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,560
much more efficiently just through a

1970
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,640
single path

1971
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,199
next slide

1972
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,679
the this is all based on on

1973
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:19,920
implementation uh and the

1974
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,199
dnac and irf currently implemented

1975
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,040
and and

1976
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,960
discussed here are

1977
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,719
only

1978
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:31,120
implemented for nodes that are

1979
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:34,960
identified by endpoint ids in the ipn

1980
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,520
uri scheme nodes that are identified by

1981
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,600
number rather than by string

1982
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,840
the same principles i think

1983
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:42,560
are

1984
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,679
applicable for other

1985
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:47,520
eid schemes

1986
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,520
i haven't tried to do anything with that

1987
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,120
at this point

1988
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,320
and dnac the node auto configuration is

1989
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,840
all based on

1990
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,440
things that are

1991
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,679
implemented only in the ion

1992
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:02,640
implementation of dtn again this is uh

1993
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,920
something that

1994
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,920
could uh

1995
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,920
i think readily be

1996
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,640
the concepts could readily be adapted to

1997
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,480
other implementations

1998
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,280
uh

1999
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,480
the uh

2000
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,080
dnac and irf

2001
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:19,520
in this uh uh demonstration

2002
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,280
and what i'm going to be talking about

2003
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,800
uh are built on some underlying

2004
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,120
capabilities have been prototyped in the

2005
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,840
ion implementation of dtn for some time

2006
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,040
now

2007
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,600
one is automatic uh contact plan

2008
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,520
synchronization that

2009
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,480
aligns contacts across all the

2010
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,920
nodes in

2011
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,360
what turns out to be a region all the

2012
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,679
nodes that are cited in that contact

2013
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:43,280
plan

2014
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,440
that in turn is based on bundled

2015
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,280
multicast which

2016
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,040
in turn is based on contact graph

2017
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,000
routing

2018
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,480
uh and there's uh

2019
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,760
uh also a reliance on the delay tolerant

2020
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:59,600
key administration uh prototype that uh

2021
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,040
has been out for

2022
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:04,320
several years now which in turn is based

2023
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,120
on

2024
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,600
uh structures called trusted collectives

2025
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,600
that are sort of

2026
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,679
i think it is a

2027
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:15,120
dtn equivalent to servers

2028
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,600
and those again rely on bundled

2029
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,800
multicast

2030
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,679
so next slide

2031
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:26,159
oh uh right this is an illustration

2032
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:27,760
and uh

2033
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,880
these slides are an example of how you

2034
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,280
use these things uh what the the way

2035
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,840
they operate uh it's not a hypothetical

2036
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,080
illustration this is actually the test

2037
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,040
case

2038
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,000
for

2039
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,159
the development of this stuff

2040
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:44,400
that

2041
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,400
now works quite well

2042
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,960
next slide

2043
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,360
so here

2044
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,679
we we start off by creating

2045
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:57,920
uh node number 21 in

2046
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,000
in the root region

2047
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,120
of the network which is region one

2048
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,520
so here's

2049
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,640
here's

2050
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,400
the the instantiation of node 21 in the

2051
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,520
usual

2052
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,840
uh intensively managed way which we've

2053
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,520
been doing for a long time

2054
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,640
in the

2055
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,120
ion development world

2056
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,600
next slide

2057
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,600
once you've got uh

2058
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,760
node 21 well you can run dna at node 21

2059
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:30,719
to create node 22 automatically

2060
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,120
and next slide

2061
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,120
node 23

2062
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:38,640
and next slide node 24. so these are all

2063
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,320
now um

2064
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,920
nodes that have been

2065
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,400
created

2066
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,440
quite easily from

2067
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,120
from just starting

2068
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:49,920
one

2069
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,040
uh node in in the root region one

2070
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,840
uh next slide

2071
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,520
the next step here is to uh create

2072
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,600
another region which is region 11 and

2073
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,000
you create a region

2074
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,400
uh automatically and implicitly

2075
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,000
by uh

2076
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,239
transforming a node from uh from what's

2077
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:15,120
uh what's called a a terminal

2078
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:18,159
node that lives only in one region to a

2079
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:20,400
passageway node that resides

2080
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,560
concurrently in two regions which means

2081
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,159
that there are

2082
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:27,280
contacts citing that node

2083
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:30,800
in the both in the contact plan for

2084
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,800
in this case region one and in the

2085
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,480
contact plan for uh region 11.

2086
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:39,360
so by making node 21 a passageway

2087
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,520
between these two regions we basically

2088
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,440
create region 11

2089
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:44,560
and

2090
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,199
next slide

2091
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:52,239
we do the same thing

2092
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:55,920
to transform node 22 a passageway to

2093
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:00,640
brand new region number 12 next slide

2094
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:05,520
we can then move nodes from

2095
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,600
one region to another so

2096
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:11,199
region 11 now exists we can move node 23

2097
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:14,239
into region 11 you can move node 24 into

2098
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:15,199
region

2099
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:16,560
uh 12.

2100
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,960
uh in this case what we do here for the

2101
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,840
purposes of the illustrations we add

2102
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:25,040
uh connectivity directly between 22 and

2103
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,560
and 24 because uh originally

2104
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,920
uh

2105
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:33,679
when the nodes 23 24 22 were created

2106
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:34,880
they only had

2107
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,600
uh connectivity back to node 21. here we

2108
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:41,840
were adding connectivity from 22 to 24

2109
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:46,239
and that enables us next slide

2110
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,320
to send a file

2111
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,800
uh using bundle protocol

2112
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:51,679
from

2113
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:55,199
23 to 24. now 23 doesn't know where 24

2114
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:56,880
is doesn't know

2115
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,800
how to reach it but it does know

2116
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,480
that uh

2117
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:04,640
24 is not in region 11 where 23 resides

2118
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,480
because 23

2119
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,159
through contact plan synchronization

2120
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:10,560
knows all the contacts within that

2121
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,080
region knows

2122
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,080
that 24 is not cited in any of those

2123
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:17,760
contacts so 24 lives in some other

2124
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,239
region somewhere and the way you

2125
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:22,719
send a bundle to a node and another

2126
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:25,280
region is that you send it to

2127
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,440
all of the passageways out of the region

2128
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,840
that you're in in this case that is just

2129
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:34,400
passive 2821 so the bundle goes to 21.

2130
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,679
uh 21 then says i don't know where 24 is

2131
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:38,640
either

2132
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,440
uh

2133
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,360
i likewise

2134
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:44,000
can only send it to 24 by sending to all

2135
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,840
the passageways out of reason one

2136
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,320
i'm not going to set it to myself so the

2137
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,800
remaining passageway out of region 1 is

2138
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,920
22

2139
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,840
i send it to 22 next slide

2140
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:02,560
and uh and 22 then

2141
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,280
has only the option of uh because it it

2142
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,600
also knows that that uh 24 is not in

2143
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,800
week one it uh knows about uh the

2144
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:14,080
contact plan for region 12 and says it

2145
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,800
it then can go ahead and forward

2146
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,880
uh the bundle

2147
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:22,480
from 22 to 24 within region 12 using

2148
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,600
the intra regional

2149
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,120
forwarding mechanism which in this case

2150
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,199
is contact graph routing

2151
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:29,920
and

2152
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,440
and as that happens

2153
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,239
node 22 sends back an encouraging

2154
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:35,760
feedback message

2155
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,880
back to the node from the passageway

2156
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,719
from which it received

2157
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:43,280
the the bundle originally saying node24

2158
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,199
is reachable through me

2159
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:48,960
and 21 then will uh next slide uh send

2160
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:49,920
the

2161
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,840
that that uh

2162
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,159
forward that that encouraging feedback

2163
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:56,400
back to 23. so the next time 23 wants to

2164
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:00,480
send something to 24 it knows uh no

2165
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,159
matter how many passageways there are

2166
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:03,920
out of region 11 i'm always going to

2167
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,280
send it to

2168
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,679
passageway 21 because that's how i get

2169
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,360
it to 24.

2170
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,920
next slide

2171
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,320
uh so okay now we uh

2172
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,600
given this little framework we use uh uh

2173
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:22,320
automatic uh node configuration create a

2174
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,560
brand new node 25

2175
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,280
uh who that is native to region 11. it

2176
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,880
doesn't get moved into it it's being

2177
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,840
created in region 11 by another node

2178
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:34,239
that is already in region 11 which is

2179
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:35,920
21

2180
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,159
next slide

2181
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,520
uh likewise we create node 26 in region

2182
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,679
12 next slide

2183
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:50,320
and the the parent of node 26 is node

2184
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,760
24.

2185
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:56,719
uh we move uh 25 to to be a passageway

2186
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:00,159
into on yet another new region 111

2187
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:02,159
uh and we

2188
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:06,320
we create region 111 by transforming 25

2189
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:09,600
into a passageway between 11 and 11.

2190
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,960
next slide

2191
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,560
and now because 25 resides in 111 as

2192
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:18,159
well as in 11 it it can create a new

2193
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:20,000
node who that is native

2194
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,880
to region 111 node 27.

2195
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,840
and now uh next slide

2196
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,960
we want to send a file from node 267 to

2197
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,560
node 26.

2198
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:31,280
uh

2199
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,760
node27 isn't the fairest idea where node

2200
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,360
26 is

2201
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:38,239
it knows that there is a passageway out

2202
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:40,639
of its own region which is 25 so it

2203
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:45,360
forwards the bundle to 25 next slide

2204
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,880
again that that

2205
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:49,120
25 knows that it doesn't make any sense

2206
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,199
to forward it back into 111 so it

2207
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,199
forwards it on to 21

2208
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:57,120
21 sends it to 22 22 sends it to 24 24

2209
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,080
sends it to 26. and there is encouraging

2210
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:03,440
feedback again uh in this picture but

2211
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,159
i've left it off of the ensuing pictures

2212
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:07,920
here because it gets

2213
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:12,400
to be just cluttered in the next slide

2214
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,400
so now

2215
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:17,360
we make node 24 a passageway between 1

2216
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,120
and 11 we

2217
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:22,000
move it back uh so that it's it's back

2218
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,159
in one in reason one but it's also still

2219
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:27,199
in region one uh one reason eleven and

2220
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:30,480
we restore connectivity between uh 21

2221
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,880
and 24 which had been broken when we

2222
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,120
moved it into 12. there's still no

2223
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,440
connectivity between 26 and 22 which

2224
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:40,880
means that when 26 wants to send a

2225
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,920
bundle back to 27 next slide

2226
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,239
uh it it has to send

2227
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:49,760
that bundle um

2228
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:50,639
to

2229
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:52,880
there are there are two passageways out

2230
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:56,639
of 12 the the bundles the nodes 22 and

2231
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,080
24

2232
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,480
in order to send it to 24 great just

2233
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,639
sends it but in order to send it to 22

2234
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:05,760
it has to send it through 24. so the

2235
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,360
even though there are two passageways

2236
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,760
going out only one of those will end up

2237
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,159
being the selected passageway because

2238
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:14,239
it's more direct and that's sending it

2239
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:17,280
to 24 which sends it directly to 21

2240
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,600
rather than sending it to 24 in order to

2241
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,159
get it to 22 to send it to 21.

2242
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:24,320
uh next slide so this

2243
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,960
th this sequence then just shows that

2244
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:30,719
happening 24 sends it directly to 21

2245
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:31,679
it

2246
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:37,040
gets to 25 and uh and then 27.

2247
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,440
uh next slide

2248
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,480
okay so now we remove 22 which was a

2249
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:46,480
passageway between 1 and 12. now 20 22

2250
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,239
is no longer a passageway we move

2251
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:51,199
removed from from region 12.

2252
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:52,320
uh and

2253
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,679
for this next

2254
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:55,280
part of the illustration we add

2255
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:58,320
connectivity between 23 and 25 directly

2256
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,800
so now there are two ways out of region

2257
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,920
11

2258
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:05,040
passageways 21 and 25.

2259
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,440
once again uh when

2260
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,679
we want to send a file from

2261
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:12,639
23 to 22

2262
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:14,639
23 sees there are two possible ways out

2263
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:16,400
he doesn't know where 22 is it sends it

2264
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,719
to 21 and also did 25

2265
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:21,280
next slide

2266
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,400
and now 25 sends back discouraging

2267
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,800
feedback saying uh

2268
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,840
thanks for for trying me but no 20 node

2269
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,080
22 is not reachable through me it is not

2270
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:32,960
in

2271
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,120
uh any of the regions that i'm in it's

2272
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,360
not in 11 it's not in 111.

2273
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,520
uh 21 uh

2274
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,760
does not say that because it knows the

2275
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,880
22 is in region 1 it forwards

2276
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,800
the bundle to 22 and it also would send

2277
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,600
encouraging feedback to 23. so the next

2278
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,639
time 23 sends to 22 it won't bother to

2279
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:56,719
send it to 25 it will only send it to

2280
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:58,560
passageway 21.

2281
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,120
next slide

2282
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,480
uh oh this is just another illustration

2283
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,280
now that we've changed the topology 24

2284
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,280
consented to 25

2285
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:14,320
directly and then the the last part of

2286
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,239
the illustration is multicast

2287
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:19,280
so here we've got node 21 sending to

2288
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,840
multicast group 76 of which there are

2289
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,159
two members 26 and 27

2290
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:26,880
and it it does that by sending a copy to

2291
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:30,239
24 so that it can reach 26 and to 25 so

2292
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:32,000
they can reach 27.

2293
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,480
uh next slide

2294
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,520
yeah that's the end of that okay so

2295
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,400
here's a

2296
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,520
hypothetical uh use case

2297
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,480
uh dnac can instantiate a new node in

2298
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,560
about a second but part of what goes on

2299
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:51,679
with with dnac is uh optionally uh

2300
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:53,920
when when d-dac operates it it creates

2301
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,639
the new node on the same machine as the

2302
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:59,520
parent node and then it optionally

2303
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,199
migrates it to

2304
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:02,960
another machine

2305
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:04,080
that

2306
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,840
the transplanting the new node to a new

2307
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,440
destination machine can take a little

2308
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:10,560
time because we use ssh and scp for

2309
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,960
example and so

2310
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,920
taking 15 seconds per node is a

2311
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,360
a reasonable

2312
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:20,159
guess at the the required time

2313
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:21,360
uh

2314
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,080
and assuming that we can have up to 33

2315
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,159
nodes in each region all right let's

2316
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:28,320
assume that we've got a list of uh 29

2317
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,080
000 machines who want to include in our

2318
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:31,840
network

2319
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,560
that would occupy

2320
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,600
879 regions

2321
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,840
the first region is populated after

2322
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:40,480
eight minutes 15 seconds per node

2323
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,000
32 more nodes

2324
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,400
and each of the nodes in that region can

2325
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,159
be the passageway to one of that

2326
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:48,960
region's subregions uh next slide which

2327
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,840
is the last slide

2328
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,880
uh each of those 32 sub-regions can then

2329
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,320
be fully populated by another 32 regions

2330
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:01,440
in each one

2331
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,440
after another eight minutes and so each

2332
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:04,480
of those

2333
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:07,040
1024 new nodes can be a passageway to

2334
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,719
another sub region

2335
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:10,320
uh and

2336
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,440
so another

2337
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:14,159
846 sub regions can be fully populated

2338
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:16,080
after another eight minutes so

2339
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,560
uh in 24 minutes you can

2340
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:19,840
automatically

2341
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:22,480
deploy a fully interconnected uh dpsex

2342
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,880
secured daily tolerant network of 29 000

2343
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:25,840
nodes

2344
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,679
uh and

2345
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:29,840
in this particular scenario

2346
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:30,719
uh

2347
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:33,520
every node in the network would be

2348
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,239
no more than five forwarding hops from

2349
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:38,000
uh any other node

2350
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,239
uh that's the end of the slides and i

2351
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:44,320
see uh two uh people in the queue so um

2352
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,880
uh hi rick i guess

2353
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:47,920
can you

2354
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:50,480
thanks scott yeah um first off i'm gonna

2355
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,719
say thank you very much for that that's

2356
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:53,760
really interesting it was really

2357
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,040
interesting to see a presentation at

2358
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,800
this sort of scale to talk about all

2359
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,880
these outstanding issues that we've got

2360
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,480
now with my chair hat on i need to

2361
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,719
remind people that of course scott has

2362
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:04,719
touched on some routing here um i

2363
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:06,000
actually have quite a long list of

2364
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,679
comments which hopefully will cover some

2365
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:09,600
of the other things because i'm aware a

2366
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,080
little bit short on time

2367
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,639
this is a classic example of

2368
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:15,679
where

2369
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:17,600
work in this area has happened in other

2370
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,360
parts of the ietf and there's a wealth

2371
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,280
of experience we can bring to bear from

2372
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,679
those other groups

2373
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:25,280
and also

2374
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,679
another reason why we need to tackle

2375
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:29,360
some of the earlier building blocks

2376
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,040
before we get onto some of the later

2377
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,320
things so

2378
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,000
um with my personal opinion on i'm just

2379
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:34,960
going to go through a couple of quick

2380
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:37,040
things i love your concept of regions i

2381
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,560
know you and i have talked about regions

2382
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,800
offline number of times before

2383
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,360
my question really is

2384
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:44,719
um

2385
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:47,199
you talk initially about regions as

2386
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:50,239
administrative areas or areas of common

2387
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:54,159
naming or perhaps uh areas that are uh

2388
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:56,960
geographically consistent uh you know

2389
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:58,880
consistent in space and time

2390
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:02,320
i i i would say actually

2391
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,960
the i think the mandatory part is that

2392
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,800
that routing

2393
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,280
routing forwarding

2394
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:13,040
there has to be a uh a consistent uh uh

2395
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:16,080
universal forwarding uh strategy within

2396
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,440
the region

2397
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,239
other elements of of commonality may be

2398
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:22,639
folded in there as well but the the

2399
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:24,800
required thing is that the

2400
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,679
uh intra regional forwarding has to be

2401
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:29,280
uh consistent

2402
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,960
yeah so so i think what you have

2403
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,880
described is the difference between an

2404
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,960
interior gateway protocol and an

2405
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,520
exterior gateway protocol in in our etf

2406
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:40,880
terms so so it's great it it's brilliant

2407
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,239
when when

2408
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:43,199
it's

2409
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:45,199
convergent evolution i would like to i'd

2410
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:47,120
like to say it's yet another example of

2411
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,760
why that model actually works so i'm

2412
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,600
really pleased to see that i'm i'm

2413
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,040
interested to see how this works when

2414
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,000
you have

2415
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:58,000
differently named regions so uh you're

2416
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,760
moving between uh endpoint id encodings

2417
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,000
so rather than everything's using ipn

2418
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,320
you can say well everything's using some

2419
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,400
sub schema of dtm and something's using

2420
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,639
an icm style naming and something else

2421
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:13,040
is using in ipm that would be really

2422
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:13,920
interesting

2423
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:14,639
the

2424
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:17,760
auto placement really worries me because

2425
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,800
i think you're conflating the deployment

2426
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,920
of a node the configuration of the node

2427
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,280
and its position within some sort of

2428
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:29,120
hierarchical routing

2429
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:31,280
regional thing i think

2430
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,840
yeah really good problem to explore and

2431
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,239
to describe but i think

2432
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:37,760
definitely need to look at what is the

2433
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,520
role of neighbour discovery what is the

2434
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:42,080
role of some sort of management

2435
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,480
system so how much is how much can ama

2436
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,400
come to play in here and and all that

2437
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:47,840
kind of stuff

2438
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,920
yeah um that's not not to talk about

2439
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,440
right now but yeah not to talk about

2440
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:53,760
right now

2441
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,600
yeah how do i just make a node appear

2442
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,840
and join my network is is just a huge

2443
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,440
problem statement but yeah i think in

2444
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,120
scope we need to kind of discuss this

2445
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:03,679
and tackle some of the points

2446
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:06,159
the third thing is is the opportunistic

2447
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:08,480
forwarding slash routing because a bit

2448
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,639
of this is rooting i

2449
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:13,040
i really putting aside the naming issue

2450
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,560
which which i'm really keen on and we'll

2451
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,239
come back to when i have some spare

2452
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:17,199
cycles

2453
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:18,560
uh the

2454
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,719
reinforcing feedback you describe

2455
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:22,719
there's a protocol called aodv which has

2456
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:24,239
come out of the manet working group

2457
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:26,880
which does exactly this

2458
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:27,760
and

2459
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:31,360
so it opportunistically explores routes

2460
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:34,320
to nodes that a node doesn't know about

2461
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,480
handles the loop avoidance uh

2462
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,719
understands aging of the information and

2463
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:40,480
all of that kind of stuff i can

2464
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,000
thoroughly recommend you go away and

2465
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,080
read it and talk to charlie perkins who

2466
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:47,679
is very very switched on in this area

2467
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:49,840
my other last request is

2468
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:50,639
um

2469
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:52,719
it's a terminology thing i love your

2470
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:54,960
word passageways but i i think we call

2471
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,840
them gateways in the ietf normally and i

2472
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:02,800
think i i specifically wanted not to um

2473
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,600
not to be in conflict with the existing

2474
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,920
use of the existing terms so i'm happy

2475
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,719
to like uh revise that but i i

2476
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:12,159
wanted to draw

2477
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:14,080
in which case i'm really at this at this

2478
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:14,960
stage

2479
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,480
i'm really interested in the difference

2480
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,800
between a passageway and a gateway then

2481
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:20,880
um but but we should probably take that

2482
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,480
offline because i'm talking a lot and

2483
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,800
other people probably i i wanted i

2484
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,800
specifically wanted not to overload the

2485
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,239
term gateway

2486
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:31,040
okay fine my final statement is you need

2487
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,239
to look at protocol independent

2488
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:34,480
multicast as well because that is

2489
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,560
multicast tree building there seems to

2490
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,800
be some real similarities here

2491
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,880
uh that's not and none of those comments

2492
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,000
are to say what you are doing is is

2493
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,199
is nothing but good i just see parallels

2494
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:49,760
everywhere with more mature and existing

2495
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:51,679
technologies that we can

2496
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:54,239
uh that that you can steal good ideas

2497
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:56,560
from learn from and perhaps do a bit of

2498
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,159
gap analysis to work out what's

2499
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:00,080
applicable and what's not but that's

2500
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,560
enough from me so i'll i'll shut up i

2501
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,400
think is this is a massive christmas

2502
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,320
mailing list conversation i see coming

2503
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:07,840
which i look forward to

2504
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,280
yeah

2505
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,599
go ahead

2506
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,639
no i was just going to go in and say in

2507
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:16,159
the interest of time we should get on to

2508
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:18,400
the last two presentations and then just

2509
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:19,440
to say

2510
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:22,560
all of this fits well within the um the

2511
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,080
the charter discussion at the beginning

2512
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,320
which is uh we're doing a lot of work

2513
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,800
that is rooted in the unique nature of

2514
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,120
our transport uh but we should also look

2515
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:32,719
at the work that's going on elsewhere

2516
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:35,040
and fill the gaps uh which i think is

2517
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,719
what uh both of you are saying so we'll

2518
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:38,719
take it to the list

2519
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:41,920
good idea um so next up i'm flipping

2520
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,320
rapidly between agendas and so on who is

2521
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:47,280
next why i can see the agenda next up

2522
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,920
we've got emery talking about the ama

2523
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:52,239
and the next steps so

2524
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:54,480
i shall approve emery's screen access

2525
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,239
and stop sharing my own

2526
01:34:56,239 --> 01:34:59,638
did that work

2527
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:09,119
excellent go ahead emery hello i don't

2528
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:10,800
know if you can hear me and see me and

2529
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:13,440
see a screen so

2530
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:16,400
up i'll move forward

2531
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,239
all right excellent so i was going to

2532
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:19,360
talk about asynchronous management

2533
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:21,199
architecture uh you know there's there's

2534
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:23,199
already a draft out there we're trying

2535
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:26,320
to rework this uh i admit now maybe this

2536
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,960
is not the right name but uh that is

2537
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,960
just and we can talk about even through

2538
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:32,880
uh through this conversation ideally

2539
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,239
here is to talk about you know some of

2540
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:37,679
the the comments back is what makes ama

2541
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:40,719
or dtn uh network management unique and

2542
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:42,560
what are some of our next steps as we go

2543
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:43,440
forward

2544
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,600
um so one of the first things kind of in

2545
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,440
our research to find out and help us

2546
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:50,080
understand why this may be unique is to

2547
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,679
better define you know what are the what

2548
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:53,119
are the use cases we're trying to solve

2549
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:55,600
this for um in particular one of the

2550
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,119
things we found recently straight from

2551
01:35:57,119 --> 01:36:00,080
rc 7228 uh the definition of a

2552
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,000
challenged network um and this is

2553
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,119
something you all have been talking

2554
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:04,800
about from my understanding for some

2555
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:08,480
time a challenged network in that dtn

2556
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:11,280
case is truly those that have the the

2557
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:13,360
incredibly long latencies and in fact

2558
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:15,440
latencies where you cannot even form an

2559
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,840
end-to-end path when when a message will

2560
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:21,600
be sent uh and expected to be

2561
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,000
received at a later point in time when

2562
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,080
the transmitter is now no longer sending

2563
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,400
um so i think that is a very unique case

2564
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,560
for challenged networks

2565
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:33,679
with that said i think dtn also has uh

2566
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:35,520
the use case of also working with

2567
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,119
constrained networks which is talked

2568
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:39,920
about quite a bit in rc 7228 the idea

2569
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,239
that those nodes and those networks

2570
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:44,400
might be limited in resources but that

2571
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:45,760
is not always true i think for

2572
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,119
challenged networks i think the big one

2573
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:50,480
here is that latency

2574
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:53,040
going to sort of what

2575
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,320
you know a lot of y'all have been doing

2576
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,960
in this working group uh they're to to

2577
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:59,040
to address those challenged networks

2578
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:01,040
y'all been developing protocols uh you

2579
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:02,320
know there's rc's i think three of them

2580
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,719
on this list here noted earlier are are

2581
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:06,560
about to go through and hopefully by the

2582
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,639
end of the year actually have an rfc tag

2583
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:10,239
on them

2584
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:12,239
new protocols to address that

2585
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:14,000
so you'll recognize that

2586
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,400
existing protocols don't meet the spec

2587
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,880
let's find new ways to address dtm

2588
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,360
management such as bundling such as

2589
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,360
bundle and bundle or sort of convergence

2590
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:26,800
layers new concepts dare i say routing

2591
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,679
but for pushing those contact plans to

2592
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:32,480
to these devices so kind of

2593
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,000
accepting that there have been new

2594
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,679
approaches to

2595
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:38,639
dtn in general uh maybe there's a need

2596
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:40,960
for detainee network management

2597
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:43,840
so the current draft

2598
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:46,000
document for ama outlines some of the

2599
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,920
services that are needed for management

2600
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,000
of those challenged networks and some of

2601
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,280
the desirable properties you can see

2602
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,119
those here i want to call out a couple

2603
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:56,560
because obviously there's the simple

2604
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:58,159
things like configuration reporting

2605
01:37:58,159 --> 01:37:59,600
administration

2606
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,520
but when you really get into some of the

2607
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,960
some of the more advanced features like

2608
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,280
autonomous uh parameterized procedure

2609
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,920
calls um desirable properties

2610
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,920
intelligent push of information the

2611
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,440
ability to

2612
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:14,080
sort of tell a node when it needs to

2613
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:16,320
send information and how to trigger on

2614
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:19,199
that um that kind of speaks to the

2615
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:21,679
rules-based execution of events uh you

2616
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:22,880
know that you aren't going to be able to

2617
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,480
talk to those nodes synchronous

2618
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:25,840
synchronously you know that you may not

2619
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:27,199
talk to them for

2620
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:29,199
days over a time but you want them to

2621
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:31,040
queue up messages

2622
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,040
reporting messages when does it cue

2623
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,520
those up how does it cue those up

2624
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,520
and then where does it send those two so

2625
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,199
some some of these are the the very

2626
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:41,840
important features that are needed in

2627
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:44,480
a dtn network management

2628
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:45,840
that we don't think it exists in some of

2629
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:46,960
the existing protocols and i'm going to

2630
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:50,400
talk through a few of those next and see

2631
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:51,760
and trying to see what might be

2632
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,080
different between those

2633
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,840
so

2634
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,199
these are some of the existing protocols

2635
01:38:57,199 --> 01:38:58,880
maybe there's others out there happy to

2636
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:01,280
talk about those um

2637
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:03,840
a note you know like for snmp yang core

2638
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,920
comp which is in the work uh same thing

2639
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:07,440
for kind of autonomic networking in the

2640
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,920
works um these are each great they've

2641
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:11,280
got a lot of great features in fact some

2642
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,119
of the features i think we want to bring

2643
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:14,480
into

2644
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:18,000
a dta network management solution

2645
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,760
but as they're written today as they're

2646
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,199
used today

2647
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:22,960
at least i think they don't necessarily

2648
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:24,560
meet the needs for that challenged

2649
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,719
network so

2650
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:28,560
talk through a few of them snmp we've

2651
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,639
probably seen it used it for for many

2652
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:32,800
years

2653
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,280
it's simple right that's in the name

2654
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,520
so i think one of the pieces here is it

2655
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,360
is purely a

2656
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:42,239
data element model the ability to pass

2657
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:43,119
very

2658
01:39:43,119 --> 01:39:45,679
single configuration items or to report

2659
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:47,119
on single

2660
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:50,400
maybe failure events

2661
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,480
it does not have any of that need for

2662
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,239
for autonomy does not have sort of

2663
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:57,040
rules-based execution is strictly just a

2664
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,920
data model for querying and receiving

2665
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,400
individual elements um one of the things

2666
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,000
that i did want to point out for snmp

2667
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,760
here is the fact that they organized it

2668
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,040
from the start

2669
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,480
with a very nice hierarchy they kind of

2670
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,719
described okay there are uh you know

2671
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:14,000
sort of the the standardized spec uh

2672
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:14,880
uh

2673
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,360
trees um and then they define each one

2674
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:19,840
of those up under that uh very clear

2675
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:22,960
sort of um this is a spec for ospf or

2676
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,719
rip or whatever it might be

2677
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:26,080
and then you have your enterprise spec

2678
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,600
switches for all of your vendors your

2679
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,159
sisters cisco's junipers and so forth

2680
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:32,159
because that's nicely organized you can

2681
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:34,400
you can reference each of the the items

2682
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,560
in this tree very easily

2683
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:37,760
which is something that i think is

2684
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,880
needed for

2685
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:41,199
challenge network management um and

2686
01:40:41,199 --> 01:40:42,080
that's

2687
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,800
some of the future work

2688
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:47,360
the next one here um this is gaining

2689
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,760
popularity a lot in

2690
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,280
in the recent

2691
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:52,719
is yang

2692
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:54,800
and as well as the protocols

2693
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,119
netconf and rest comp

2694
01:40:57,119 --> 01:41:00,800
yang is a full featured data model has a

2695
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,840
lot of capabilities for

2696
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,639
defining a

2697
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:07,840
very very complex data structure for how

2698
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:10,719
you would either access information from

2699
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:11,440
a

2700
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:14,080
server or node that is being managed as

2701
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:16,480
well as how you can configure those

2702
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,320
one of the interesting pieces is yang is

2703
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:21,119
purely a data model so

2704
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:24,080
any of the autonomous behavior that you

2705
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,760
need to build into

2706
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:29,440
yang is accomplished via the netcomp or

2707
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,040
rest comp protocols

2708
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:34,000
comp itself is very synchronous so you

2709
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,719
need to establish that session to a yang

2710
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:38,800
server uh tell it what you want to

2711
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,080
configure tell it what you want to

2712
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,639
receive and that session remains

2713
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:44,719
connected the entire time

2714
01:41:44,719 --> 01:41:45,679
that you're trying to send and receive

2715
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:46,960
those commands so i think that one

2716
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:48,480
immediately kind of falls off the the

2717
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,800
table for a challenge network

2718
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,880
rest comp changes that a little bit so

2719
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:56,560
it's restful uh is definitely designed

2720
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,880
to sort of send commands to

2721
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,040
uh update that data model on the remote

2722
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,719
server or send commands and say i want

2723
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:05,040
to retrieve information

2724
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,880
but it still at least is currently

2725
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,119
written highly dependent on

2726
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:12,560
a secure sort of protocol tls

2727
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:15,600
it is definitely uh

2728
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:17,360
and it's limited to the yang model as

2729
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:19,679
well right so so i mentioned yang as

2730
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:22,080
being a data model if you wanted any

2731
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,159
sort of back and forth or collect a

2732
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:26,320
large data set uh you would have to

2733
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:29,280
request that large data set um which

2734
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:32,159
then the the message on the wire or

2735
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:36,000
or error is pretty verbose so

2736
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,080
that's kind of speaking to netconf and

2737
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,920
rest comp

2738
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,520
there are

2739
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:44,560
updates or or you know new new protocols

2740
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:46,960
uh either existing or in the works which

2741
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:48,400
are trying to

2742
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:50,880
remove some of that synchronous behavior

2743
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:53,119
so this is uh some of the now kind of

2744
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:55,360
called out as asynchronous behavior of

2745
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:57,600
yang so you've got both subscription to

2746
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:01,280
yang notifications and yang push

2747
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,760
very nice because you can subscribe to

2748
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:05,679
the data elements of

2749
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:08,480
the yang module but again because it is

2750
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:10,400
only a data model

2751
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:12,239
you you are limited in what you can do

2752
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:14,159
so you can subscribe to an element in

2753
01:43:14,159 --> 01:43:15,199
the model

2754
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:18,000
and you can say send me updates send a

2755
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:22,400
yang push update when that model changes

2756
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:25,760
or when or at a periodic interval but as

2757
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:27,199
it's defined today those are the only

2758
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:29,760
two options you have to configure for

2759
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:32,719
yang uh so that that falls back to that

2760
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:34,880
you know if you need sort of rules-based

2761
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:37,440
execution of events such as maybe i've

2762
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,679
crossed a threshold or

2763
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:42,560
you know an error condition happened

2764
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:44,159
you would not necessarily be able to

2765
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:47,679
trigger uh a larger set of uh of a

2766
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:49,760
report or sort of a state of what's

2767
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,760
happening so

2768
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:54,800
kind of differentiates those

2769
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,719
uh last couple things to talk about here

2770
01:43:56,719 --> 01:43:59,440
so there is an entire working group it's

2771
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:01,920
the constrained um

2772
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:04,320
uh resources working group uh they

2773
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,400
develop a protocol under that called

2774
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,800
constrained application protocol uh as

2775
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,159
you can see in the picture here it sort

2776
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:12,880
of fits on top of the transport layer uh

2777
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:15,840
can be used for applications um

2778
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,679
or anything talking to these constrained

2779
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:19,040
devices you're talking about like sort

2780
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:21,920
of embedded iot uh

2781
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:23,760
low low process load memory sort of

2782
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,239
devices um so the protocol was designed

2783
01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:28,800
to be very concise uh

2784
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:31,440
which is something we kind of need in

2785
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:33,520
the the challenge network

2786
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:35,920
but kind of going further

2787
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:37,040
how are they approaching network

2788
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,639
management well they are developing i

2789
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:40,239
think it's in the works right now a new

2790
01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:42,320
protocol called core conf

2791
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:45,840
which is going to use that yang library

2792
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:48,880
use the co-app protocol

2793
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:51,840
to then talk to devices

2794
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,600
and push you know

2795
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,360
data updates to the model or retrieve

2796
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,679
elements from that model so a few

2797
01:44:57,679 --> 01:44:59,440
comments there you know again you're

2798
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:04,320
bound to yang um and uh and and because

2799
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,639
there's a lot of concern i think

2800
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:07,440
for

2801
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,840
hey we're start to expose management of

2802
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:12,159
devices over the network they're trying

2803
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:14,960
really hard to push um security features

2804
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:17,679
into the core comp protocol

2805
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:19,199
i think that's

2806
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:21,119
not bad it's great for the use case i

2807
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:22,400
think for you know some of the

2808
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:24,000
challenged network use cases especially

2809
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,080
when you look at how you are approaching

2810
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:29,040
transport by a bp sec

2811
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,119
bundle security which is an entire

2812
01:45:31,119 --> 01:45:33,920
protocol to to put security into the

2813
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:36,560
transport mechanisms um you might be

2814
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:38,639
limited to then have an extra layer of

2815
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:40,880
security if you were to try and use this

2816
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:41,760
uh

2817
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,840
there's also the sort of

2818
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:45,360
yang item

2819
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,920
identifiers or sids this is how they can

2820
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:50,719
concisely encode

2821
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:52,239
access to each of these data elements

2822
01:45:52,239 --> 01:45:54,080
inside the protocol

2823
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:56,719
which is a nice approach but at least as

2824
01:45:56,719 --> 01:45:59,280
i read it today there's no hierarchy

2825
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:01,119
there's no way to reference kind of

2826
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:03,679
going back to that snmp oid structure

2827
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:05,360
there's no way to sort of reference

2828
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:06,960
these are

2829
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:10,000
rfc spec or vendor specs and then sort

2830
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,760
of what is the way to get down to the

2831
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,760
particular data element without directly

2832
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:16,480
addressing them with possibly quite

2833
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:17,920
large ids

2834
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:20,880
so it makes a little bit different

2835
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:22,480
the last one i wanted to mention i don't

2836
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:24,400
think anyone has talked about it much

2837
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:27,440
but because we call out that autonomous

2838
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:31,440
behavior is a desirable property of

2839
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,600
of of challenged network management i

2840
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,600
think it's fair to at least acknowledge

2841
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:37,199
some of the work that's going on in the

2842
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:38,960
animal working group as well as the

2843
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:41,280
network management research group um

2844
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,119
autonomic networking and intent based

2845
01:46:43,119 --> 01:46:44,239
networking

2846
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:46,960
so what really differentiates those

2847
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:50,320
maybe from dtn management

2848
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:52,400
these are you know actually kind of goes

2849
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:54,719
back to the the last presentation the

2850
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:56,560
ability to drop a node in a network and

2851
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,560
have it self-configure self-optimize

2852
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:01,360
self-heal and so forth um there's a lot

2853
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:03,280
of work to do that

2854
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:05,760
what i understand is there there's a

2855
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:08,080
need for very synchronous sort of uh

2856
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:09,679
communication and connectivity between

2857
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:11,920
these nodes uh there's also a need for

2858
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:14,400
supporting infrastructure like dns like

2859
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:16,880
dhcp that can help once you drop the

2860
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:18,639
node and it and it talks over that

2861
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:20,480
autonomous control plane it knows how to

2862
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:22,159
then start to self-configure because it

2863
01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:23,760
gets a little bit of information to talk

2864
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:25,920
to these particular services

2865
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:27,840
so again kind of going back to what is

2866
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,679
that challenge network use case

2867
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:33,040
very different from this one as well

2868
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:35,679
so i kind of mention all of these things

2869
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:38,800
i think there's a lot that we can learn

2870
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,480
and borrow from these different

2871
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:42,320
protocols but

2872
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:44,880
why i'm talking to you today is to say

2873
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,880
do we think uh

2874
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:49,440
any of these are applicable to

2875
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:52,239
challenged networks um have i missed

2876
01:47:52,239 --> 01:47:54,400
anything have i misunderstood anything

2877
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,719
and do we agree that there is sort of a

2878
01:47:56,719 --> 01:47:59,119
a unique need to challenged network

2879
01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:01,600
management today so

2880
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,199
i will pause i see actually rick in the

2881
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:04,480
queue

2882
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,800
speak up let me know

2883
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:08,400
first off emery thank you i think this

2884
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:12,320
is a really good gap analysis of what's

2885
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:14,000
out there in the ietf at the moment

2886
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:14,960
which is

2887
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:17,440
particularly relevant as as really that

2888
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:20,000
is what the ops area directors asked us

2889
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,960
to do so if we can

2890
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:24,000
um

2891
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
try and capture this information in the

2892
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,639
ama document as well

2893
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:30,400
then i think that will make that

2894
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:33,360
document great my second

2895
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:34,639
point is

2896
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:37,440
i would really like to present the

2897
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:40,159
inverse of this pres or you to present

2898
01:48:40,159 --> 01:48:42,080
or someone to present the inverse of

2899
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:44,159
this presentation to the netmod

2900
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:47,199
community at the next ietf so basically

2901
01:48:47,199 --> 01:48:49,440
instead of presenting to us to say this

2902
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:50,880
is what everyone else is doing and why

2903
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:53,840
it's difficult present to them

2904
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,840
you have all of this and this is why it

2905
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,920
doesn't quite work for us help us i

2906
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:00,480
think that would be a a great uh

2907
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:02,719
conversation opener with them so that's

2908
01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:05,520
kind of a request to you or or someone

2909
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:08,080
you work with or know well to to try and

2910
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:09,360
put that together we can take that

2911
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:12,159
offline but otherwise thank you really

2912
01:49:12,159 --> 01:49:16,159
good um that's all i wanted to say

2913
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:18,000
roger no i i completely agree i mean

2914
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,840
working through this has been actually

2915
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,280
nice because it actually helps us

2916
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,280
understand you know okay

2917
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:25,040
what are those desirable properties what

2918
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:26,960
makes it unique uh and then we can talk

2919
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,599
about those more clearly so uh i agree

2920
01:49:29,599 --> 01:49:31,040
and i'm happy to do that

2921
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:32,239
um

2922
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:34,400
my last comments here right so we are

2923
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:37,040
working on an updated ama spec uh we

2924
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:38,480
we've started to include some of these

2925
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,080
differentiators in the one that was

2926
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:42,719
published right before itf-112

2927
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:44,880
i think there is a little bit more work

2928
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:47,119
that's needed to really emphasize like

2929
01:49:47,119 --> 01:49:48,960
the rule-based autonomy clarify that

2930
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:50,639
need for hierarchical

2931
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:53,679
moderated absolute data definitions um

2932
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:55,199
really really clarify that it's

2933
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:56,880
independent of the underlying transports

2934
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:58,000
you look at all these other protocols

2935
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,400
and they say well it must use udp or it

2936
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:02,800
must use tls and so forth

2937
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:04,480
i think that is something different for

2938
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:06,719
challenge network management um and try

2939
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:09,599
and make sense of this so the last slide

2940
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:11,840
uh next steps right just like you said

2941
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,920
continue to work with these other itf

2942
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:16,080
working groups discuss overlap discuss

2943
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:18,320
what's good and bad from each uh and

2944
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,239
then we start to look into the the maybe

2945
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:21,679
more interesting things right what are

2946
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:23,040
those application data models

2947
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:24,960
asynchronous management models the

2948
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:26,800
protocol and so forth so

2949
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:27,640
i'm it done

2950
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:30,560
[Music]

2951
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:32,159
any other questions

2952
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:34,000
no this is ed i just wanted to come back

2953
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,960
and echo what rick had said this is an

2954
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:40,560
excellent um you know sort of updated uh

2955
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:42,880
review of both what dtn needs for

2956
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:45,199
management and how it fits into uh sort

2957
01:50:45,199 --> 01:50:47,679
of these emerging other ecosystems in

2958
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:50,480
the ops area and getting a presentation

2959
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:52,320
uh the inverse presentation of this over

2960
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:54,000
to them is absolutely something that

2961
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,280
we'll get on the

2962
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:56,960
on the books for the next work for the

2963
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:59,840
next ietf

2964
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,719
awesome thanks um

2965
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:04,960
thanks very much emery uh so i think

2966
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:07,119
next up i i do need to find a way of

2967
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:08,960
getting the agenda on the same page as

2968
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:10,080
everything else i'm trying to do we've

2969
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:14,719
got sarah uh talking about uh another

2970
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:16,800
part of the management piece sarah are

2971
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,320
you okay presenting your own slides or

2972
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:20,800
do you want to shout next at me

2973
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,960
yeah i can present my own slides okay

2974
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:25,679
excellent no worries

2975
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:28,879
go ahead

2976
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:34,040
okay

2977
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:48,000
i'm having some difficulty sharing if

2978
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,440
you want to share then that would that'd

2979
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:51,839
be okay

2980
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:57,840
if you go again i had to click a button

2981
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:00,080
to accept again so if you just it was me

2982
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:03,080
sorry

2983
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:07,920
is that

2984
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,239
i'm still getting an error

2985
01:52:10,239 --> 01:52:12,400
okay no worries uh let me

2986
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:14,159
i just closed the window typically give

2987
01:52:14,159 --> 01:52:16,159
me 20 seconds just to go and re-actually

2988
01:52:16,159 --> 01:52:18,560
it's available inside here

2989
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:20,880
they've provided those asynchronous uh

2990
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:22,080
look at that

2991
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:22,960
right

2992
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:24,239
now i have to work out how to do the

2993
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:27,040
share share

2994
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:31,040
okay thank you

2995
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:33,280
um yes so my name is sarah hubbell and

2996
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:35,360
i'm presenting um

2997
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:36,719
the

2998
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:38,320
asynchronous network management system

2999
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:40,080
which is a project we have going on here

3000
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:42,719
at jhupl um

3001
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:44,560
again this is this is for the management

3002
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,880
of challenge networks uh we are tracking

3003
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:47,599
the

3004
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:49,520
name change and and we'll make changes

3005
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:52,480
accordingly as as we continue our work

3006
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:54,560
um next slide

3007
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:56,560
so as we all know managing dtn networks

3008
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:59,760
is important in the anms project we are

3009
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:01,199
incorporating all of the work from the

3010
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:03,040
standards community into a tool to

3011
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:04,239
manage

3012
01:53:04,239 --> 01:53:05,599
challenge networks

3013
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:06,960
the tool we're developing is meant to

3014
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:08,719
show that we can build a console using

3015
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:11,840
dtm standards that both operators will

3016
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:13,360
understand and will like to adopt

3017
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:14,960
permissions

3018
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:17,119
this tool will incorporate amp and all

3019
01:53:17,119 --> 01:53:19,520
the future changes to the specification

3020
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:22,080
whereas we also plan to feed any

3021
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:24,719
required modifications etc that we

3022
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:26,400
discovered and our development of this

3023
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,480
tool back into this community

3024
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:30,719
for discussion

3025
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:34,400
um next slide please

3026
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:38,639
so the goals of our system are listed on

3027
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:40,719
this slide

3028
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:42,159
in short we want to be able to monitor

3029
01:53:42,159 --> 01:53:43,280
and control

3030
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,360
network nodes and challenge networks

3031
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,040
interoperate with existing network

3032
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:48,639
management tools

3033
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:50,880
and be able to manage implementations of

3034
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:52,800
bundle protocol agents

3035
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:55,119
we're initially testing with ion

3036
01:53:55,119 --> 01:53:57,119
integration since it ships with a

3037
01:53:57,119 --> 01:53:59,199
reference and an agent but we should be

3038
01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:00,560
able to operate with any bp

3039
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:02,400
implementation once once our development

3040
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:04,879
is complete

3041
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:08,280
next slide

3042
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,480
so this one's getting a little bit into

3043
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:12,159
our implementation

3044
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:15,440
this is a layer 1 decomposition of

3045
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:18,080
how we see a ms fitting into a larger

3046
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:20,639
mission control system so the blue

3047
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:23,840
stadium or pill shape in the middle is

3048
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:25,280
the ams tool and everything it

3049
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:27,840
encapsulates we plan to provide services

3050
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:29,360
for data management system

3051
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:32,480
administration automation orchestration

3052
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:34,320
health monitoring agent command and

3053
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:35,280
control

3054
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:37,360
et cetera and we see this interacting

3055
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:39,599
with agents on the network for

3056
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:42,000
bp as well as interacting with

3057
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,920
other machines on the network for legacy

3058
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:46,639
protocols such as netconf and and other

3059
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:48,080
protocols that were that we're

3060
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:49,840
envisioning

3061
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,920
human users of the system

3062
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:53,840
will be mission operators and network

3063
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:56,800
admins we plan to provide default user

3064
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:58,960
interfaces for mission command

3065
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:01,040
and visualization of reports coming back

3066
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:04,080
from agents

3067
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:06,559
next slide

3068
01:55:09,599 --> 01:55:11,360
so this is getting a little bit more

3069
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:14,320
into how we are breaking up a ms among

3070
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:16,800
different modules while we are

3071
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,960
developing it the key point here is that

3072
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:20,400
we we do want to build the system in a

3073
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:22,239
modular fashion

3074
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:23,760
in order to allow users to be able to

3075
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:25,840
plug their own solutions into ours to

3076
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:28,560
the maximum extent possible

3077
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:30,159
so this slide shows a notional

3078
01:55:30,159 --> 01:55:32,320
representation of our layer of three

3079
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:34,400
architecture um

3080
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:36,159
the so the central processing block

3081
01:55:36,159 --> 01:55:37,920
there will be handling all of the

3082
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:39,760
automation and orchestrations or

3083
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:41,840
activities it has a local

3084
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:46,000
um agent there running to to do uh

3085
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,679
things like state-based rules time-based

3086
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:50,320
rules for the for the local system

3087
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:53,199
uh we have a data access layer

3088
01:55:53,199 --> 01:55:55,360
um for all of the the

3089
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:58,080
data needed to orchestrate this system

3090
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,760
uh the agent clearinghouse will handle

3091
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:02,080
everything coming in from agents

3092
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:04,560
application access is everything coming

3093
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:06,080
in from um

3094
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:08,080
the user interface and and things like

3095
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:09,599
that that we build out

3096
01:56:09,599 --> 01:56:11,920
uh the transcoding piece there is is a

3097
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:13,280
little bit interesting so that one will

3098
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:14,719
handle

3099
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:17,520
translating between any different uh

3100
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:20,320
representations of of commands to to

3101
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:23,599
agents so obviously right now we're

3102
01:56:23,599 --> 01:56:25,280
we're focusing on

3103
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:28,400
like string encodings going to seabor

3104
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:29,119
but

3105
01:56:29,119 --> 01:56:31,360
we do want to make that one plugable as

3106
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,360
well so you can plug in your own codex

3107
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:35,040
for any sort of

3108
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:37,760
agent specific encodings you need

3109
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,520
network access handles everything

3110
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:41,440
talking out to the network and it's kind

3111
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:43,199
of small on this slide but

3112
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:45,440
there's um three diamonds three purple

3113
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:47,440
diamonds at the bottom right are the

3114
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:49,119
default visualization tools so that

3115
01:56:49,119 --> 01:56:51,520
would be the

3116
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:53,119
visualization of health and things on

3117
01:56:53,119 --> 01:56:55,280
the network as well as admin and agent

3118
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:58,159
command and control

3119
01:56:58,239 --> 01:57:01,040
next slide please

3120
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:04,320
so along with the modular theme we are

3121
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,000
building the system out to allow

3122
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,599
distributed deployment of system

3123
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:08,800
components

3124
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:10,800
so in other words the entire system

3125
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:12,800
could be deployed on a single machine as

3126
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:14,880
shown in the upper left

3127
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,639
or it will be able to be deployed across

3128
01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:18,320
a number of physical and virtual

3129
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:21,599
machines as shown in the bottom right

3130
01:57:21,599 --> 01:57:23,599
our goal for this approach is to allow

3131
01:57:23,599 --> 01:57:25,360
adoption independent of the

3132
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:27,599
organization's deployment strategy

3133
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:31,360
whether it be local physical servers or

3134
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:34,320
cloud deployment such as aws or any

3135
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:36,719
cloud vendor

3136
01:57:36,719 --> 01:57:39,840
next slide please

3137
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:43,920
so our project is set up in five spirals

3138
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:46,000
over the course of the next two years we

3139
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,440
are currently in the first spiral of

3140
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:49,440
development and plan to make spiral

3141
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:51,440
releases open source as they are

3142
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:52,880
completed

3143
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:54,560
for spiral one we're focusing on a

3144
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,080
single motivating use case to get

3145
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:58,480
everything just up and running

3146
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:00,000
so at the end of the spiral we'd like

3147
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,119
users to be able to configure am a

3148
01:58:03,119 --> 01:58:04,400
agents

3149
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:06,080
for report generation and receive

3150
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:08,080
reports back and display them in our

3151
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:09,760
visualization tool

3152
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:11,360
um to kickstart development we're

3153
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:14,000
currently using existing ion

3154
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,159
agents um and a lot of our effort is

3155
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:17,679
actually actually focused on

3156
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:20,480
containerization of components for easy

3157
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:22,800
deploy and integration at this point

3158
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:25,119
we expect our first release to come out

3159
01:58:25,119 --> 01:58:27,520
in early 2022 and we're looking forward

3160
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:29,520
to interacting more with the community

3161
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:32,880
and receiving feedback at that time

3162
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:37,199
i think my last slide next slide

3163
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:39,360
so this is just to wrap up here's a

3164
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,520
depiction of our logical view of

3165
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:42,800
um the different components that we're

3166
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:44,400
building out and the functionality and

3167
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:45,440
each

3168
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:47,760
the yellow boxes are

3169
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:49,440
the ones that we

3170
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:51,440
envision working on during this part

3171
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:52,960
during this first spiral

3172
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:54,639
everything will be built out as we as we

3173
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:56,719
progress but that will be what the first

3174
01:58:56,719 --> 01:58:58,639
cut looks like

3175
01:58:58,639 --> 01:59:03,840
um i believe that is it any questions

3176
01:59:04,159 --> 01:59:06,159
you see somebody in the queue go ahead

3177
01:59:06,159 --> 01:59:08,638

3179
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:13,840
is a very very interesting topic

3180
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:17,440
um you you mentioned you want uh you

3181
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:19,280
basically would like to have feedback uh

3182
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:21,360
what specific areas we are you are

3183
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:24,239
looking feedback for

3184
01:59:24,239 --> 01:59:26,480
um so once we get the tool uh once we

3185
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:27,920
get the first iteration of the tool out

3186
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:29,840
there just usage different things you'd

3187
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:31,520
like to see

3188
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:33,119
whether or not the visualization works

3189
01:59:33,119 --> 01:59:34,320
for you

3190
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:36,320
i mean even feedback on

3191
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:38,639
if you have any specific areas that we

3192
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:40,239
should focus on for our future spirals

3193
01:59:40,239 --> 01:59:42,480
like prioritize then then we could do

3194
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:44,320
that but really once once our first

3195
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:47,280

we will be asking for the working group

3254

a bigger pardon we'll be asking for the

3255
02:01:57,119 --> 02:01:58,560
working group adoption of the two

3256
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:00,000
documents that were requested i'm just

3257

checking my notes and

3258
02:02:02,639 --> 02:02:04,239
that's probably it anything you want to

3259
02:02:04,239 --> 02:02:05,599
add ed

3260
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:08,400
yeah just uh two things uh as we start

3261
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:10,639
talking now about milestones associated

3262
02:02:10,639 --> 02:02:12,800
with some of those uh

3263
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:15,520
work areas uh please if you want to work

3264
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:17,280
on those we're gonna put a call to the

3265
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:18,800
mailing list but that doesn't mean in

3266
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:20,480
the interim you can't jump forward on

3267
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:22,000
the mailing list and say i would like to

3268
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,199
work on this and we could start

3269
02:02:23,199 --> 02:02:25,280
proposing and having those milestone

3270
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:27,760
date discussions and then lastly just

3271
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:30,639
for uh for ronnie bull in in the chat uh

3272
02:02:30,639 --> 02:02:32,400
he did post a link to

3273
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:34,400
another project in the ipn sig and some

3274
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:36,400
of the work they're doing for dtn in a

3275
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:37,920
report that's coming out and we should

3276
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:40,159
also be cognizant of that additional

3277
02:02:40,159 --> 02:02:42,480
work so those were my two last items

3278
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:44,480
okay uh yeah i just thought one last

3279
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:45,599
thing a couple of people have got

3280
02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:48,000
personal drafts on topics which are on

3281
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,719
the new charter if they want to just

3282
02:02:50,719 --> 02:02:52,880
reissue them to sort of bring them back

3283
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:55,040
to life in the document tracker that

3284
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:57,199
would be great uh even if you just

3285
02:02:57,199 --> 02:02:58,800
change the name and resubmit it will

3286
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:00,639
keep it alive rather than it

3287
02:03:00,639 --> 02:03:03,679
disappearing into the limbo of expired

3288
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:06,159
personal drafts but otherwise uh thank
