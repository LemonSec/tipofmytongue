phenomenal introduction justin thank you

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,039
yes

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,480
the clock has just ticked over

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,640
uh but i don't think we have a

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,359
hugely packed agenda so i'm not gonna

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,119
quite be in a hurry to start i think

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,760
we've neck is only showing about 70

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,840
people

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,640
we might get

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,960
a few more trickling in from the gather

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,840
town hallway

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,000
i think the suggestion of uh working

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,399
group theme songs might be something we

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,760
have to talk about in the future maybe

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,440
at the open mic i just saw in the chat

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,160
yeah so think i have to talk about that

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,160
so thank you deb cooley for helping us

this is not new to anyone but

53
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,360
we have a number of authoritative bcps

54
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,560
that lay out the sort of ipr regime

55
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,720
for which

56
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,959
that applies to the itf meetings idea

57
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,480
contributions so please note them well

58
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,360
uh

59
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,720
next slide

60
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,319
also

61
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,280
we want to remind everybody about

62
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,120
you know the the

63
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,040
itf guidelines for conduct that we want

64
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,519
to aspire to um

65
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,959
so

66
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,200
if we can always make sure to

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,360
be respectful and courteous to other

68
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,519
participants and

69
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,840
to remember that

70
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,280
you know

71
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,040
the the background and the assumptions

72
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,800
that we bring to the table are not going

73
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,560
to be universal like different people

74
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,519
are coming in with different uh

75
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,959
environments that they run in and

76
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,879
different needs for their technical

77
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,440
situations and so we want to acknowledge

78
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,480
that

79
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,840
there are going to be different

80
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,440
assumptions and perspectives coming in

81
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,120
and we want to try and understand those

82
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,640
and work to the best solution overall

83
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,200
all right uh next slide

84
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,560

85
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,159

86
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,680

87
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,560
supplementing what we had on tuesday

88
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,000

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,440

104
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,800
yeah we did not have enough content to

105
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,479

going to the working group summaries

108
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,280
so we've

109
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,720
asked of course the working groups to

110
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,919
send a summary to the mailing list which

111
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,840

[Music]

141
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,160
i was going to provide a quick summary

142
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,240
on ohio we um spent most of the time

143
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,759
reviewing the proposed starting point

144
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,520
drafts and i think we've uh we did an

145
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,720
adoption call at the end of the meeting

146
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,960
which was pretty favorable

147
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,560
um

148
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,840
confirming that adoption call on the

149
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,400
list right now

150
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,280
documents

151
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,120
i got a little bit of a compressed audio

152
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,560
stream there but it sounded like we had

153
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,160
a good meeting with some adoption calls

154
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,840
coming out so thanks for that

155
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,240
it'll be exciting to to see the progress

156
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,199
going on there

157
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,960
uh so i think we can go to the next

158
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,400
slide

159
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,160
uh yeah actually

160
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
just barely slip over onto two slides of

161
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,479
groups not reading um but if you go back

162
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,280
to the first one i

163
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,840
tried to remember a few notes on that so

164
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
curdle is

165
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,000
probably going to close once the last

166
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,919
document gets through the rfc editor

167
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,080
it's in the queue there

168
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,400
um

169
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
and i think

170
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
many of these groups are holding

171
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,800
interims uh whether dedicated or

172
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,039
periodic regular interims

173
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,319
uh so it's not like they're they're not

174
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,479
doing any work at all

175
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,440
and then

176
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,440
back to slide two the

177
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,880
second event

178
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,240
group

179
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,560
is uh probably also going to be closing

180
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,960
scene there was

181
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,880
we finished the chord drafts uh some

182
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,000
time ago and then there was energy to

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,199
work on one more related draft and we

184
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,280
should either finish that up or just to

185
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,599
declare victory and close

186
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,680
so i will be

187
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,919
trying to talk to the chairs and working

188
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,560
group about that in the coming weeks

189
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,520
uh sean go ahead

190
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,000
yeah hi as ben noted we had an in room

191
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,639
for mls i did just like seconds ago send

192
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,639
an update um to the mailing list so

193
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,199
people can see it um the the nutshell

194
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,400
here is that we're about done with the

195
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,919
protocol draft the next version is going

196
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,360
to probably enter working group last

197
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,840
call sometime in december and then

198
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,120
hopefully we'll get enough reviews on

199
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,479
the architecture draft so we can work

200
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,240
into a blast call that and so then we

201
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
can send both to the isg you know

202
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,840
hopefully in the first quarter of

203
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,520
2022 great yeah it'll be definitely good

204
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,079
to have both drafts to look at together

205
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,719
okay i think we should keep going so

206
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,039
let's see related work

207
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,519
i didn't want to call out uta

208
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,240
because there are i believe is documents

209
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,839
for both 61 25 and

210
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,200
75 25 which relate to

211
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,440
your recommendations for certificate

212
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,880
verification and also just general tls

213
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,760
usage parameter guidelines

214
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
so this would be very much of interest

215
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,439
to a large part of the community

216
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,760
and thank you to the utah chairs for for

217
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,360
sending that note to the list as well

218
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,959
um

219
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,080
there also has been

220
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,800
some noteworthy activity going on in the

221
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,120
model t program from the iab and i

222
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,399
believe yari is going to send a summary

223
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,279
uh later today i think but it's not in

224
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,839
quite yet

225
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,680
so

226
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,720
this is a opportunity if anybody

227
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
knows much about some related work

228
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,360
whether or not it's listed on this slide

229
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,839
please feel free to uh to jump up to the

230
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,720
mic i think sam weiler also sent

231
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,080
just now an update from the

232
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,320
w3c

233
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
which has quite a bit of potentially

234
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,120
interesting work going on just uh just

235
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,360
skimming the email lisa

236
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,480
so

237
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
that as well

238
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,160
while we have folks coming up to the mic

239
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,240
to talk about uh some of the some of

240
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,680
these activities here i want to mention

241
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,720
we did

242
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,320
hold the priv

243
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,720
uh i think it was quite successful there

244
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,680
was quite a lot of support voiced for it

245
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,079
uh also what it was positive out of it

246
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,000
we have some tangible action items on

247
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
where the community thinks the scope

248
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,680
should be should be tuned and all of

249
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,200
that is fully documented in the minutes

250
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
and i would expect in the coming weeks

251
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,880
that there will be revisions to that

252
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,800
draft charter and we should have some

253
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,360
community discussion on whether the box

254
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,040
and the scoping of that is right and

255
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,839
whether we can move forward

256
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,000
thanks ramen

257
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
and i'm not seeing anybody training the

258
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,720
queue either so i guess

259
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,320
we can keep going and of course we'll

260
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,440
have the open mic at the end of the

261
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,720
meeting as well

262
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,279
if there's more to cover

263
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,160
uh so i guess i can say a few words

264
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,440
about uh

265
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,320
my two 80 sponsored drafts here the

266
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,120
security txt is in the rc editor queue

267
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,720
and it's actually still waiting on me

268
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,959
we had been preparing to go forward with

269
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,480
some very generic abnf for the file

270
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,760
format

271
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,720
but

272
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,720
i got some updated abnf from murray

273
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,519
that actually can represent the full

274
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,560
pgp

275
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,839
clear sign header footer and whatnot

276
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,440
and so i need to actually go and

277
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
validate that and get another review and

278
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,200
then we should be able to to go forward

279
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
with security txt

280
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,839
uh numeric id set considerations is

281
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,959
still a little bit stalled i didn't

282
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,720
really make any progress on that since

283
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,680
itf 111.

284
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,120
yeah so for my documents uh the

285
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,160
the updated ers asn kind of one modules

286
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,320
are with the rfc editor i think it's all

287
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,880
quite straightforward from there

288
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,200
and then i just started processing the

289
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,399
update to

290
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,760
6931 the best document to get the new

291
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,040
uris for for all the various xml

292
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
security kinds of things that's really

293
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,720
new with in terms of being in revised

294
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,959
kind of aed uh i i expect we can

295
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,560
probably get that button up relatively

296
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,200
quickly we do do still need w3c

297
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,800
concurrence and kind of feedback on it

298
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,360
before you know we get we get to ietf

299
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,800
last call

300
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,040
thanks

301
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,440
all right uh other things to note uh

302
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,519
from ben and my kind of perspective the

303
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,040
first thing we just wanted to call out

304
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,920
is

305
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,240
earlier this week we updated the wiki

306
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,320
that talks about the security area to

307
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,160
refresh the content and make it

308
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,760
hopefully a little more accessible to

309
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,320
understand how to bring new work and for

310
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,480
others perhaps not steeped in all the

311
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,160
different sec area kind of processes

312
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,959
about how sector works and how you know

313
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,120
this this venue kind of sag works so

314
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,639
please take a look if you think we're

315
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,480
missing content you know by all means

316
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,399
kind of let us know we'd like this to be

317
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,000
you know something that is a resource

318
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,959
and is accessible to folks

319
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,360
uh uh other highlights and this is this

320
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,440
is a repeat that we do really every time

321
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,920
uh we we meet here in sag is we just

322
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,160
like to reiterate that based on the work

323
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,480
done by sector and the process that ben

324
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,200
and i go through in all the ad and

325
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,639
telechat reviews that there are

326
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,040
recurring issues that do come up fairly

327
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,519
commonly we do have those documented and

328
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,320
as you know in augmentation as folks uh

329
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,079
go are getting already published their

330
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,480
documents or as working groups are ready

331
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,399
to send things to itf last call we would

332
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,560
strongly urge them to consult that list

333
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,800
to make sure that it does not manifest

334
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,839
itself in in that document

335
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,920
also in the spirit of transparency you

336
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,519
know this is not a new feature but you

337
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,760
know it it constantly actually kind of

338
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,279
comes up that folks don't realize that

339
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,519
this is possible if you want to know

340
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,760
what ben's queue looks like or my cue

341
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,040
looks like you know where we're holding

342
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,680
documents what the rest of the sec area

343
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,959
kind of looks like in terms of

344
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,279
processing after it exits the the

345
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,800
working group so in iesg review uh or in

346
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,040
last call you can you can use those two

347
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,480
urls to get that status information

348
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,160
uh and then the other thing we wanted to

349
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
highlight is one of the actions we are

350
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,800
holding is the continued thread on what

351
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,000
we do with post quantum agility so since

352
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,680
that does come up and it came up in the

353
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,320
the sag session kind of in session one

354
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,800
we did make a summary page that you see

355
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,040
referenced there that pulls together all

356
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,560
the different conversations that we've

357
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,880
had and we still have an open thread on

358
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,279
the main list to give us more feedback

359
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,839
on that proposed charter so we know how

360
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,000
to to move forward

361
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,399
yeah i think we've got one reply to that

362
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,480
thread so far so it'd be good to get

363
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,920
additional input

364
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,040
yeah i mean there's a little bit of a

365
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,880
mismatch between some of the private

366
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,560
communication we're getting supporting

367
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,480
it and you know any commentary on that

368
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,079
mailing list and that's what that's what

369
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,399
we really need uh to help us figure out

370
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,480
how to proceed

371
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,560
uh there's been some changes in where we

372
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,480
stand with working groups uh i know we

373
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,240
we often kind of talk about broadly in

374
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,040
the itf how has coved impacted you know

375
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,519
the creation of new work so from the sec

376
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,680
area perspective since the last time

377
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,760
we've met we have spun up three new

378
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,160
security focus working groups uh

379
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,279
we we talked about ohi in the in the in

380
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,120
the working group reports dance is going

381
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
to be meeting for the first time

382
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,480
tomorrow and skim which is

383
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,399
not in the security area but highly

384
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,560
related to kind of security uh based on

385
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,800
historical reasons is still staying in

386
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
art and that reopened and met earlier

387
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,120
this morning for the first time

388
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,160
in terms of uh work closing so the trans

389
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
working group concluded since the last

390
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,920
time we met and in terms of major

391
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,040
rechartering uh suit is is is now

392
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,279
actively kind of talking about how to

393
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,440
how to do a little bit more based on the

394
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,240
based on the the the work that's already

395
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,680
that's already getting ready to move

396
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,360
outside the working group on the core

397
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,959
manifest and now we're talking about

398
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,518
extensions

399
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,279
and you know ben and i can't reiterate

400
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,920
enough the help that the sector provides

401
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,680
and that should read since we last got

402
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,639
together in ietf 11. those reviewers you

403
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,199
know provided detailed things for itf

404
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,720
last call they provided detailed

405
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,920
feedback for the telechat and these

406
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,759
these contributions these reviews

407
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,480
directly impact the quality and the

408
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
security properties of those documents

409
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,160
and it's tremendous that it's done we

410
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,000
thank you so much for making it all

411
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,079
possible to us really contributing to

412
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,399
making the internet a more secure place

413
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,880
because you've invested your time

414
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,720
yeah definitely a big thanks to all the

415
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,040
sector viewers it's a real big help

416
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,600
okay so with that uh we're ready to

417
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,720
switch over to our first and only formal

418
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,920
agenda item so the the tls chairs are

419
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,440
going to talk to us about what

420
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,320
recommended guidance uh looks like so

421
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,440
joe

422
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,199
are you briefing or sean we'll get your

423
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,758
slides up

424
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,000
yeah i can i can uh present um

425
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,119
perfect

426
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,559
do you want me to

427
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,760
nope i'm granting you permissions

428
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,079
okay let me uh figure out which one this

429
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,839
is that must be this one

430
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,280
all right

431
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,640
here we are

432
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,000
uh thanks everybody for uh joining

433
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,240
good afternoon evening

434
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,080
morning um

435
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,880
so we're going to talk about 8447 bits

436
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,679
and the inftls recommended column

437
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,480
um

438
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,160
many of you may be aware that uh rfc

439
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,280
8447 which is iana considerations for

440
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,840
tls

441
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,240
um defined a recommended column for most

442
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,440
tls registries

443
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,600
and this has been populated with either

444
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,080
the character y or the character n

445
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,799
the character y meaning generally this

446
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,640
parameter is generally recommended for

447
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,880
implementations to support

448
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,280
um and n is generally a record for an

449
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,720
implementation

450
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,240
not to support

451
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,760
um

452
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
and

453
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,880
this says you know probably

454
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,919
most

455
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,160
uh

456
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,559
driven by

457
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,640
uh cipher parameters you know crypto

458
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,039
parameters such as cipher suites and

459
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,480
groups and things like that but it

460
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,640
applies to um other things such as uh

461
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,320
um

462
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,080
you know extensions and other tls

463
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,480
parameters as well

464
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,919
the uh

465
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,679
in order to

466
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,760
get something assigned and why it

467
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,679
requires um

468
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,160
ietf standards action

469
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,400
um

470
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,520
so part of the feedback we received is

471
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,840
that maybe two values aren't enough

472
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,799
because

473
00:18:58,799 --> 00:18:59,679
n

474
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,679
could result from various different

475
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,039
situations

476
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,640
one could be just that we haven't

477
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,760
evaluated it so we get many requests for

478
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,280
uh ciphers that that we often will

479
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,240
allow

480
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,760
um that

481
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,600
really may not have been out evaluated

482
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,160
by anybody in the ietf or or in the in

483
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,039
the

484
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,960
uh

485
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,880
in our in our community

486
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,120
um and so it's hard to make any

487
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,039
statements about them and it's not

488
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,720
something that we could necessarily do

489
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,880
to evaluate all these things nor maybe

490
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,919
should we

491
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,520
um

492
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,440
there are also things that we would not

493
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,360
recommend in any circumstance perhaps

494
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,600
it's a deprecated algorithm like rc4 or

495
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,000
md5

496
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and then there may be cases where

497
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
something is applicable only in certain

498
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,760
cases

499
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,520
so in the latest version of

500
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,280
rfc 40 84 47 this

501
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,760
we took the approach of

502
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,000
adding an additional

503
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
state here so there's

504
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,960
yes

505
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,440
uh is recommended for general use as it

506
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,720
was before

507
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,000
no the parameters are discouraged for

508
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,080
general use

509
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,440
and then there's

510
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,600
you know a lack of any character at all

511
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,760
would be the parameters are unevaluated

512
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,159
this is saying this the ietf hasn't

513
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,240
evaluated this there's no statement to

514
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,000
be made here by the ietf

515
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,919
now in the tls working group on

516
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,480
tuesday morning uh we also presented

517
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,039
this as as part of uh the artist that

518
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,400
changes in rfc 8447 bis

519
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,840
um

520
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,760
and the additional feedback that we got

521
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,880
was

522
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,840
that hey perhaps there should be more

523
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,159
or different meanings here so for

524
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,000
example to indicate when something is

525
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,360
deprecated or something is limited use

526
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,280
and since

527
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,600
these things are

528
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,480
are

529
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,559
this

530
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,799
kind of arrangement is probably of

531
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,320
interest to the security committee at

532
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,000
hall we wanted to

533
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,600
bring it here and have some discussion

534
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,720
and sag

535
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,080
on what uh

536
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,120
what would be good values what what

537
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,960
should be be communicating here because

538
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,720
it's something that maybe other working

539
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,240
groups would pick up

540
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,679
um

541
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,919
and so that's where we are so if you'd

542
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,480
like to come to the mic and and chat

543
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,000
that would be wonderful i don't know

544
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,120
sean do you have anything to add

545
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,480
no i believe you sufficiently captured

546
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,880
all of the points

547
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,960
hecker

548
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,520
yeah

549
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,640
ah

550
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,159
okay yeah so i i think this is like

551
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,440
slightly more complicated than perhaps

552
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,400
it needs to be um but um uh

553
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,440
um

554
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,640
like in particular i think we could put

555
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,600
together um n and d into one thing but i

556
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,240
also don't really care very much um

557
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,400
um you know um i think i think i think

558
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,600
it'd be fine i think i guess what i

559
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,360
would say is it seems like some of these

560
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,360
are gonna require some sort of like

561
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,400
explanation

562
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,039
um like particular especially like the n

563
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,600
um and so like a major i mean as you may

564
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,480
know me if you're gonna have an

565
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,159
explanation but you can fold it and i

566
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,080
mean n and d together and i guess i

567
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,559
don't understand everything l and an l

568
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,880
but again i don't also hear that much um

569
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,720
um i guess one thing i would say is that

570
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,360
um i don't think we should rename

571
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,520
i don't i don't think that i don't think

572
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,360
n should be used

573
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,200
in

574
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,799
the one thing i do feel strongly about

575
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,000
is that um is that we should not use n

576
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,360
with a meaning you have it here and the

577
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,880
reason is because it already has an

578
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,240
existing meaning which is the thing you

579
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,039
have with with blank space now and so um

580
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,039
it's like i i don't care if we rename it

581
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,320
in the field and then we can rename them

582
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,840
or whatever but like just don't keep the

583
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,600
thing called recommended and have end

584
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,880
mean something

585
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,720
and now means like it didn't used to be

586
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,640
it's like my my thesis

587
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,880
um

588
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,360
but yeah so i'm like why not i'm going

589
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,720
to hold on basically anything because

590
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,320
like i just think like it's like not

591
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,840
that big a deal which ones we do so like

592
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,600
let's just get it done

593
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,320
okay fair enough

594
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,919
stephen

595
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,280
yeah i i i think the current state of

596
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,760
play is where it is better uh i don't

597
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,440
think any any of these changes are

598
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,919
improvements uh in particular the one on

599
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,360
screen here

600
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,440
what what does evaluated by the ietf

601
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,120
mean i mean and people will argue that

602
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,039
and they'll come along and say

603
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,039
you know i i

604
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,120
you said deprecated are limited and what

605
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,640
how did you evaluate my thing and we're

606
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,240
going to argue about all the possible

607
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,440
things

608
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,279
so i think two values is the right

609
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,159
answer

610
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,159
i don't care if it's called n or any

611
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,559
other set of characters but

612
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,320
anything beyond that is going to waste

613
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,960
lots more time for people above the itf

614
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,120
and i don't personally believe

615
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,360
that there's any additional clarity by

616
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,360
having n blank d or l or or any anything

617
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,200
more than one negative value is is

618
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,240
useless in my opinion

619
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,600
alrighty

620
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,480
harness

621
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,159
hi um

622
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,159
and very early in the slide deck you

623
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,840
talked about um

624
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,919
or you had uh different

625
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,799
rules for uh behaving and and you talked

626
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,159
about like people have different

627
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,880
perspectives um work on the internet but

628
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,480
then there are all sorts of deployment

629
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,200
circumstances and and one thing

630
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,600
uh that i noticed is there's

631
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,159
of course the web is quite important um

632
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,520
to everyone

633
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,720
um but dls is used outside the web space

634
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,120
and and

635
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,679
there often

636
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,480
um

637
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,679
kind of a

638
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,880
ignorance um to those other uses be

639
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,880
outside the web and

640
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,640
that's that's why it gets tricky because

641
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,480
some of the extensions we work on are

642
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,880
used in those spaces and they they are

643
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,880
used on on millions and billions of

644
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,039
devices but they are just not the web uh

645
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,240
and so people treat them as um

646
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,279
not fit for general use because uh for

647
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,760
them the channel uses the web only right

648
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,480
they don't care about these other users

649
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,720
and that's that's the that's why we have

650
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,279
dedicated documents that talk about the

651
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,240
applicability of dls in other domains

652
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,200
and

653
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,520
for whatever reason we try to

654
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,240
sum all of this up in a in an entry in a

655
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,960
table in the iron registry if nobody

656
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,400
would look at that

657
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,559
it wouldn't be a problem but but of

658
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,840
course people

659
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,360
don't read the documents they just look

660
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,440
at the table

661
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,360
that's

662
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,918
my problem

663
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,880
now honestly one question would would it

664
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,320
help if we i don't believe we link to

665
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,440
documents just like if we were to

666
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,120
have something that was limited or

667
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,559
deprecated

668
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,720
um

669
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,840
with that help with having a link to

670
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,760
uh

671
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,720
the document that described why or or

672
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,600
made that statement

673
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,600
for example for the limited use like

674
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,799
having a

675
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,159
document that

676
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,320
describes what the use is would

677
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,400
obviously be

678
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,720
valuable for someone who looks at that

679
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,000
table

680
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,840
but of course like at what point do we

681
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,320
actually replicate uh

682
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,440
the documents themselves right

683
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,760
so yeah

684
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,000
okay robin

685
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,840
uh robin are you

686
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,760
i'm showing phil next in the queue

687
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,559
all right

688
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,640
dropped off as far as i can tell

689
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,400
maybe he took himself off

690
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,039
yeah um i i'm also a to uh

691
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,720
two stater

692
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,600
um i think that basically

693
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,720
we should

694
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
we should not distinguish between stuff

695
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,799
we don't recommend

696
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,919
and stuff we haven't evaluated

697
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,320
we should just have a list of the stuff

698
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,520
that we have looked at and recommend

699
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,480
and

700
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,000
the only thing that will do for anything

701
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,200
else is give it a code point

702
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,039
and the reason for that is i

703
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,039
specifically don't want to get into the

704
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,640
business of

705
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,559
itf uh

706
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,480
evaluating crypto

707
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,279
i'm

708
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,880
i'm not sure

709
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,360
who i mean the only mechanism that we

710
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,559
know of to evaluate a crypto algorithm

711
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,520
is a crypto competition that takes four

712
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,120
or five years

713
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,399
and that's just what that's our

714
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,600
mechanism

715
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,360
whether it's this that runs it or cfrg

716
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,760
and

717
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,440
somebody at itf looking through a bunch

718
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,880
of papers and not seeing something bad

719
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,640
that's not a crypto algorithmless view

720
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,240
so i just don't want to get anywhere

721
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,520
close to that

722
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,640
so

723
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,320
i i want to have a small a number of

724
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,279
recommended algorithms as possible

725
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,480
preferably no more than two

726
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,640
the one that we use and the one and the

727
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,919
backup

728
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,159
and everything else i i'd even like to

729
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,399
see a separate table

730
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,399
put the code points in a separate table

731
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,760
and

732
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,000
anybody who wants to first come first

733
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,399
served if we start to run out of code

734
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,520
points

735
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,679
um

736
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,520
find a hack that allows people to use

737
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,559
annoyed

738
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,039
in its place that would require the

739
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,480
negotiation

740
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,440
scheme to be extended of course but

741
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,279
i i i don't want to get into

742
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,240
telling people that their crypto is good

743
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,279
because

744
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,799
nobody has that expertise

745
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,158
okay

746
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,559
john

747
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,679
i i um

748
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,240
i agree we're very much with what thomas

749
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,080
said about different

750
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,720
use cases i think it's important to

751
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,640
differentiate between

752
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,600
these

753
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,000
i don't know i just read read the beast

754
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,880
document i i see nowhere here

755
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,360
that it says general

756
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,919
use or that the recommended column has

757
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,679
anything to would use

758
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,760
it seems to still be

759
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,600
support is that something

760
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,200
new that has been added recently or

761
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,080
no that's that's just a mistake on my

762
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,799
part yeah i think that

763
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,960
that maybe illustrates the hardness of

764
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,440
understanding is recommended call on if

765
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,200
the shares cannot done

766
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,960
it either yeah i rest my case

767
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,840
so yo i'm gonna jump in ahead of you

768
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,799
just to do jabber management here uh

769
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,559
robin's comment

770
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,399
because there was no audio is for any

771
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,120
value other than why yes implementers

772
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,600
will want or need to know why in which

773
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,760
case they should read the rfc so an

774
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,279
extra one-byte value in the fields

775
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,760
doesn't add anything

776
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,480
okay yola

777
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,000
i pretty much want to agree with that so

778
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
one of the things that

779
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,960
8447 did that i think is wrong is that

780
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,760
they

781
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,880
made the same column for all the ayanna

782
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,840
registries for tls so

783
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,120
this

784
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,640
yes no or

785
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,360
unknown is very fitting for

786
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,279
the cypher suites because we can say

787
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,480
that yeah asgcm is yes

788
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,399
rc4 is no

789
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,159
this new cipher coming out of the

790
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,279
ukrainian government i don't know

791
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,600
so that makes sense but extensions when

792
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,799
are you ever going to do a no extension

793
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,880
and we'll just not standardize it if we

794
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,880
don't like the extension

795
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,159
uh so

796
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,720
yeah i know we can find example where

797
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,120
we didn't like an extension anymore

798
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,720
so in my opinion there's the yes the the

799
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,960
things that we don't want people to use

800
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,880
everything else has new ones like

801
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,360
deprecated or limited use it's good for

802
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,080
this

803
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,320
everything else is nuanced so go read

804
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,720
the document that describes the

805
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,360
extension or cipher suite or whatever

806
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,080
to

807
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,960
know whether it's applicable or not

808
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,760
so

809
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,559
i think yeah three values of

810
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,120
yes no and

811
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,360
go read the document

812
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,080
or

813
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,960
what we really need

814
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,480
okay thanks

815
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,320
rich

816
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,360
oh yeah um

817
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,559
my

818
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,240
i think we need to handle

819
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,480
oh this was you know recommended and

820
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,320
then there's you know one of those silly

821
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,399
die die die drafts came out

822
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,240
and we need to change that value from

823
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,399
you know we need to change the value so

824
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,159
i don't care what the value is

825
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,120
as commented on the chat a space as an

826
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,360
indicator is a bad idea in terms of you

827
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,600
know accessibility readability

828
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,679
understandability pick some character

829
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,600
make it a shrug make it a poop emoji

830
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,360
whatever

831
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,360
but my biggest concern

832
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,600
is

833
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,919
whatever set of parameters

834
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,000
or values we pick

835
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,360
it should be possible to unambiguously

836
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,159
and without judgment calls

837
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,320
decide what they are

838
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,519
because otherwise it's going to come to

839
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,760
it'll be written in the rfc and that may

840
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,039
show up

841
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,159
via the

842
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,960
ise path which doesn't really have

843
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,080
you know doesn't reflect ietf consensus

844
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,039
um or you'll defer it to you know the

845
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,880
designated experts which are currently

846
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,399
me yov

847
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,600
and nick and i don't want that

848
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,760
so as long as you can describe an

849
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,120
algorithm

850
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,600
that is determinable

851
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,399
and

852
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,880
and not halting um

853
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,159
i don't care what letters you can we'll

854
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,799
just follow those directions

855
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,159
okay thanks uh watson

856
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,440
uh watson live cloudflare uh i'm i see

857
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,600
there's a lot of discussion about

858
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,840
wanting to use non-recommended

859
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,320
extensions and ciphers as sort of some

860
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,799
of the motivation for changing this but

861
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,320
we haven't i haven't really heard

862
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,360
specific examples or where

863
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,200
we've had debates in tls working group

864
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,799
about depreciation people saying well we

865
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,000
can't declare scientists depreciate

866
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,679
because it's still in use

867
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,760
and really i think we should be doing

868
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,159
changes here as the start of the

869
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,079
depreciation process we need a way to

870
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,119
signal

871
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,960
that you should be moving off this

872
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,960
and we should expect an ecosystem whose

873
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,599
participants have a way to

874
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,000
move off of things

875
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,119
and i i think that that

876
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,918
you know when we talk about limited use

877
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,399
i'm not really sure it has a place i

878
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,159
like the idea of explicit depreciation

879
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,280
mark although i'm not sure

880
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,359
what the exact difference between d and

881
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,199
n is

882
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,480
um

883
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,199
and again i i think a space is not a

884
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,639
great idea

885
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,239
um

886
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,760
that's where we could put in but i also

887
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,879
don't think we should be limited to

888
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,480
single letters i think something like

889
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,800
not evaluated can fit perfectly fine

890
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,560
okay thanks

891
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,920
you're on

892
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,240
so as background i'm cool also on 75 uh

893
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,119
25 the tls recipe and now 75 25 best

894
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,920
if we go into neurons here we will want

895
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,480
support documentation and that means

896
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,640
that people will be working

897
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,520
on documents that explain why something

898
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,800
is deprecated or of limited use

899
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,960
and i think it will make the current

900
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,480
situation

901
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,920
where we have deprecation documents

902
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,960
coming from the tls working group

903
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,320
and

904
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,200
us in utah

905
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,480
trying to to chase them or make sure

906
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,720
there are no conflicts

907
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,440
and yeah we are talking to one another

908
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,599
but we're really duplicating work and

909
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,400
setting ourselves for for

910
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,240
the you know

911
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,839
duplication and conflicts and all sorts

912
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,599
of funny situations

913
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,599
thank you

914
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,359
so are are you

915
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,320
is it a coordination issue or is it like

916
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,160
we shouldn't be deprecating things or

917
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,800
um

918
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,000
at the moment it's coordination issue

919
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,240
i'm not sure we should be

920
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,440
deprecating things or i think 70 75 25

921
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,640
did it well and was well accepted

922
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,720
for the things it did

923
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,400
um and we could use the same mechanism

924
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,520
perhaps

925
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,200
five years between versions of 75 25 is

926
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,400
too much

927
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,760
perhaps not

928
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,680
but i think it's a discussion we need to

929
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,320
have rather than just running to

930
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,680
processes in parliament

931
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,839
okay thanks

932
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,240
becker

933
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,440
all right i'd like to make several

934
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,079
points um first like we absolutely do

935
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,800
need this column for uh for extensions

936
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,880
there are lots of extensions which are

937
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,280
not defined by the itf and we're just

938
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
reserving code points for um to give you

939
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,480
some examples um the three tlmsp ones

940
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,000
which i had to approve which involved

941
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,599
reading like a ton of specs about like

942
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,320
you know um about like auto stuff um

943
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,640
which i didn't read uh ticket pinning

944
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,800
password salt password protect password

945
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,720
clear um so these are all things which

946
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,320
like need copper reservations but we do

947
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,920
not think or like we have no opinion on

948
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,000
or probably maybe secretly think are bad

949
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,760
and so like we absolutely need to call

950
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,160
them for these things um so now i think

951
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,280
the question now becomes what is the

952
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,480
conscious decal

953
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,200
um and and for all for all of these and

954
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,000
i think there are several you know um

955
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,079
the um so i think like obviously we need

956
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,000
y um and um i think it's impossible have

957
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,480
included um we didn't look and we think

958
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,920
this is bad right those are the two

959
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,599
things that like that like n basically

960
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,480
means um and um

961
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,880
or or i think also like and i'll get

962
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,040
back to this limited use case thing um

963
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,920
so um now but separately so it's got a

964
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,359
bunch of things that have ends on them

965
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,839
um and then um separately we are on

966
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,599
publishing documents that say this thing

967
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,440
is actually bad like we published you

968
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,599
know md5 die die die or sha one die die

969
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,480
die right and so um i i do think it's in

970
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,359
value um to have a um

971
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,560
uh uh uh um

972
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,320
a way to indicate that the itf is like

973
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,359
after we looked at this thing and now

974
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,280
things just like actively bad and did

975
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,400
not be used and so i think that

976
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,680
motivates some sort of bad thing and i

977
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,040
understand like the concerns there's

978
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,480
gonna be a lot of like debate about that

979
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,440
but i don't think there actually has to

980
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,280
be because like we didn't we didn't have

981
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,720
like we already had that debate about

982
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,599
how to publish the documents in the

983
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,480
first place and so like you know the the

984
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,079
the the point of this column in this

985
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,440
case is merely as rich says to

986
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,960
memorialize the decision the items

987
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,079
already made which these protocols are

988
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,760
bad right so i don't think that actually

989
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,760
requires a lot of litigation um beyond

990
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,640
that um so like the what i propose is a

991
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,640
um is a minimum three states one of

992
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,880
which is good which requires um i guess

993
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,800
specification one of which is we haven't

994
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,560
looked at it which requires nothing and

995
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,920
one of which is this is bad which also

996
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,920
requires anti-specification and as i say

997
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,960
since we're already doing all those

998
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,079
things anyways it's a mechanical

999
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,480
transformation from from the um from

1000
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
from the work we've done now the one

1001
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,200
that is like slightly difficult i think

1002
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,280
is a sort of limited use one and iron

1003
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,760
mcdonald raised this a little bit in um

1004
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,599
in the chat um

1005
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,440
and um

1006
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,400
uh and uh the cases for those under used

1007
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,000
ones and yes dkg right there should be

1008
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,160
reference um the case of them in used

1009
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,640
ones is there a bunch of cases where um

1010
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,480
we've had to make unpleasant compromises

1011
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,720
about the security of the system um

1012
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,280
because um uh uh um

1013
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,040
uh because of some case we're like like

1014
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,560
like um you know there's uh there's like

1015
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,839
a lesbian with less cpu or something

1016
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,079
like that right and um and so like a

1017
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,640
good example is ccm8 and so i think you

1018
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,160
know what we could try to stuff that

1019
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,440
into the yes you know yes um uh um you

1020
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,640
know uh

1021
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,680
um no no opinion a bucket which i

1022
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,040
suppose in those cases would go in no

1023
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,680
opinion um but um

1024
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
i think you know we all really are like

1025
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,480
optimal cases right and so i think

1026
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,839
there's some arguments he made to allow

1027
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,319
them to have some um

1028
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,520
yeah as you have said microsoft

1029
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,720
environment these algorithms use less

1030
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,680
memory so i think there's like some

1031
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,839
cases to have like their own marker um

1032
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,680
but like also willing to have like i

1033
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,200
think if we simply had a freeform field

1034
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,400
that went in no opinion that'd be okay

1035
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,720
as well um but as i said i do think we

1036
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,920
need to use those three states because

1037
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,920
um because i think we it's kind of weird

1038
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,599
for us to go around it's like because

1039
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,920
mandy's an n are like we haven't looked

1040
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,599
and conflating that we looked in this is

1041
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,079
terrible like seems like a mistake

1042
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,680
and i hear people saying they'll be all

1043
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,960
a debate about this but since like we've

1044
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,319
already as i say we've already observed

1045
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,160
that debate when we had we decided to

1046
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,200
publish these documents in the first

1047
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,439
place

1048
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,319
yep make sense

1049
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,440
all right is there

1050
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,520
do you want to try to do dkg's idea of

1051
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,280
trying to slim down to

1052
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,400
two

1053
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,960
three or more so we can try to focus the

1054
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,040
conversation

1055
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,079
uh

1056
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,520
yeah sure i mean what i can definitely

1057
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,599
see that you know from from the

1058
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,400
discussion like what we have here

1059
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,160
we like n

1060
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,520
and

1061
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,960
space could be combined i think um

1062
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,119
because they're really

1063
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,960
um

1064
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,200
there's more states than i think we

1065
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,720
than anybody has asked for

1066
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:37,119
um so we'd have

1067
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,280
and and i think there is reason to do

1068
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,359
deprecated um

1069
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,800
i think we could there still could be

1070
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,400
debate about that but

1071
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,480
um i think some of the concerns of how

1072
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,319
do we determine something's deprecated

1073
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:49,839
deprecation

1074
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,560
like recommendation requires

1075
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,760
some sort of

1076
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,040
document

1077
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,359
action

1078
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,319
but uh i i didn't i i don't haven't

1079
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,640
followed exactly what dkg said so if you

1080
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,040
have that

1081
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,599
it was just to do a call to see whether

1082
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,440
like we should just keep it as is with

1083
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,800
buy or no

1084
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,640
expand it to three or do more

1085
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,200
so my idea was just to offer three hums

1086
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,160
um

1087
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,800
only raise your hand and don't

1088
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,920
don't uh not raise your hand and just

1089
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,760
raise your hand for the one of the three

1090
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,040
that you prefer

1091
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,400
or if you prefer more than one you could

1092
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,079
raise your hand multiple times and then

1093
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,880
we get a count of who's going for

1094
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,119
um who wants to keep it at two options

1095
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,560
who wants to go to three and who thinks

1096
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,440
that more than three is important

1097
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,520
okay

1098
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,319
so the two options would be as they are

1099
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,960
today which is uh yes and

1100
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,200
uh not uh

1101
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,520
yes and not evaluated

1102
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,440
yes and not yes right

1103
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,880
okay and then uh three would be yes and

1104
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,079
not yes and definitely no

1105
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,680
right right which i called y and bad

1106
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,760
why inside we keep the the labels y and

1107
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,160
then as they are

1108
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,560
and then uh there would be

1109
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,960
uh then the question would be for more

1110
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,920
so

1111
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,920
um

1112
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,760
candy do i can i run the to

1113
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,920
the uh thing or do the chairs have to

1114
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,920
run that

1115
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,040
i think the chairs have to run the

1116
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,040
the chairs have to do that let me just

1117
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,280
boost the candidate text before we get

1118
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,520
started on all three

1119
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,040
yep

1120
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,720
ah sorry the line breaks

1121
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,560
all right

1122
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,000
so

1123
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,560
it's yes no

1124
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,040
two is

1125
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,040
yes no

1126
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,359
bad

1127
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,400
yes no and bad

1128
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,040
and three is

1129
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,480
we need to talk more because it's more

1130
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,960
than the three states

1131
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,200
yeah

1132
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,520
right

1133
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,720
okay so we're going to do the hand raise

1134
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,280
and it's just we we're not going to look

1135
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,839
at the explicit do not raise hand option

1136
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,680
we're just going to look at the count of

1137
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,319
raise hand

1138
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,079
okay so this is going to be the yes and

1139
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,079
no

1140
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,078
that's just the two choices

1141
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,760
so

1142
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,160
if you like the the only two states in

1143
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,720
the registry column

1144
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,200
and michael i think you were briefly in

1145
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,359
the mic queue i don't know if

1146
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,240
that was a misclick

1147
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,960
do you think we should only have two

1148
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,119
states right and if you want three

1149
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,319
states or four states you should vote

1150
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,560
later right

1151
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,759
yes yes okay

1152
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,400
and then after that if someone doesn't

1153
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,160
like any of those three options you can

1154
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,598
come to the mic and tell us about it

1155
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,280
okay i guess the accounts basically

1156
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,760
stopped going up so in this and we had

1157
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,240
15 hand raises for the the two option

1158
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,118
yes or no

1159
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,760
so this would be so the next poll is

1160
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,440
gonna be for the three option case

1161
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,839
yes no and

1162
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,960
all right yes it was yes no opinion and

1163
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,160
bad

1164
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,118
yes yes no bad

1165
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:23,839
and again

1166
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,359
you can of course click the do not raise

1167
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,599
hand button but that is not part of the

1168
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:32,359
data set that we expect to be looking at

1169
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,800
okay i guess we'll call that pretty

1170
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,680
stable so that's 32 for the the three

1171
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,599
option case

1172
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,319
and then the uh

1173
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,560
the third thing we're gonna vote for was

1174
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,839
i guess uh

1175
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,440
more

1176
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,440
and three

1177
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,800
options

1178
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,040
or

1179
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,119
requires further discussion about what

1180
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,359
they are

1181
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,680
did i end the

1182
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,960
last ballot

1183
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,760
i it just disappeared for me

1184
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,240
i apologize i i accidentally hit that

1185
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,599
button

1186
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,000
okay uh so i guess i will just run the

1187
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,880
same thing again because we closed it

1188
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,400
too quickly

1189
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,720
sorry about that

1190
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,839
no it

1191
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:52,400
happens

1192
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,880
the big red button is is right there if

1193
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,559
you have the right permissions and who

1194
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:01,000
can resist pushing on the big red button

1195
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:15,359
and just a reminder if you previously

1196
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,000
were trying to fill out the this third

1197
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,920
poll you need to

1198
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,000
to decide again positively to raise your

1199
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,520
hand here if you want

1200
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,079
if you want to be counted

1201
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,160
okay i think that's looking pretty

1202
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,520
stable as well

1203
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,119
so i will deliberately end the

1204
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,240
raise hand session now

1205
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,079
so

1206
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,960
that was 18 hand raised for the the more

1207
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,839
than three options case so that's a

1208
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,319
modest preference for the three option

1209
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:05,119
case it looks like

1210
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,040
but perhaps not a truly definitive

1211
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,680
conclusion

1212
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,319
so

1213
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,400
i guess

1214
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,680
my my own personal stance which i'll

1215
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,400
take because i already have my gone

1216
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,240
is that it sort of seems like we have uh

1217
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,960
enough support to say like let's

1218
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,800
actually write up write a draft for this

1219
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,319
three option case and try and get more

1220
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,240
feedback on that

1221
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,760
and of course if people want to write up

1222
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,920
the other cases as well in more detail

1223
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,680
that's obviously fine

1224
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,400
but this is probably a path forward joe

1225
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,000
shawn does that seem like yeah i think

1226
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
that that sounds good to me i think

1227
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,920
we'll write that up and see what it

1228
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,920
looks like and then we'll obviously get

1229
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,400
more feedback um

1230
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,640
as we go

1231
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,079
drop in a link to the

1232
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,559
repo if somebody wants to write text

1233
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,559
for prs

1234
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,920
in the chat thanks

1235
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,599
okay um

1236
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,920
so

1237
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,240
is that uh

1238
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,680
enough of the feedback that you wanted

1239
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,359
from from this presentation slot

1240
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,800
that's this is excellent um um i guess

1241
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,480
you know it's the tls working group

1242
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,920
doing this thing but if others are other

1243
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,920
working groups are adopting it or

1244
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,520
are thinking about it that they should

1245
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,440
think along the same lines possibly

1246
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,839
right

1247
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:45,440
and i will just note that

1248
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,440
i did not read all of the chat but i see

1249
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,359
a little bit of discussion going by

1250
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,839
about

1251
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,160
the relationship between the work of the

1252
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,480
utah group and

1253
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,240
you know having this

1254
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,119
registry column at all

1255
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,240
but i think

1256
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,319
that would probably be something more to

1257
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,279
take to the list

1258
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,839
so it seems like the other issue to take

1259
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,319
to the list is what happens to

1260
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,640
the l category that was previously

1261
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,879
talked about

1262
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,640
from my perspective i don't have any

1263
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,319
problem if if like

1264
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,400
a document is is defining the use of

1265
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,240
something that it points you know can

1266
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,680
get pointed to from the registry you can

1267
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,760
always include more references there

1268
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,599
typically you know most of the things

1269
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:40,960
we're talking about have been out have

1270
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,280
been cipher suites which maybe there's a

1271
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,880
whole lot of references get added that

1272
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,559
way but if it's this particular

1273
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,240
extension that comes in

1274
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,079
you know automotive use case or whatever

1275
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,440
is the one that was being discussed i

1276
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,040
mean the extension comes in there's a

1277
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,200
reference column for what that is and it

1278
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,440
gets an n and that's okay people can go

1279
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,000
read why the n is we do have to expect

1280
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,680
it's i mean i know that

1281
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,880
a lot of this problem is that people

1282
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,280
that aren't reading the documents that

1283
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,640
are referenced in the iana

1284
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,559
considerations section but that's why

1285
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:09,760
it's there so at some point we have to

1286
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,880
kind of push them to do a little work

1287
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:21,759
okay

1288
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,160
chris go ahead

1289
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,520
or maybe that was a

1290
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:40,319
spurious queue entry from chris inacio

1291
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,640
uh rome do you want to bring up the

1292
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,200
chair slides just so we can put the open

1293
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,960
mic

1294
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,000
uh slide up

1295
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,119
but uh as we prefaced

1296
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:00,880
into that talk

1297
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,559
that was the the

1298
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,119
the tls recommended column was the only

1299
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,880
schedules as united we have so we're

1300
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,520
into the open might open mic section

1301
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,720
so please join the queue

1302
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,160
seen anyone jump up to the queue here

1303
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,520
i'm not singing either

1304
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,280
and we are actually

1305
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,200
doing okay on the time management with

1306
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,880
our scheduled

1307
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,760
one hour that we had for sag

1308
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,920
leaving space for sec dispatch if they

1309
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,240
needed it

1310
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,599
okay oh chris reports that he he was

1311
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,040
trying to get in the cube but his audio

1312
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,240
was broken

1313
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,800
he wanted sean turner to clarify on the

1314
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,200
automotive use case if there are active

1315
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,200
algorithms for automotive that aren't

1316
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,000
recommended for general use

1317
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
i do not so i don't know that specific

1318
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,240
list i was probably mixing the

1319
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,800
algorithm and extension use uses in my

1320
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,240
head because typically you know like one

1321
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,760
one document points to the algorithms it

1322
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,200
gets defined and then it just gets used

1323
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,359
in a bunch of places um so there are

1324
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,359
lots of references there

1325
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:31,680
they get pulled in that way um so there

1326
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,200
would already be a hey it's not useful

1327
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,880
here and then if people really wanted to

1328
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,079
know they could figure out that way with

1329
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,480
an extension it's slightly more direct

1330
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,000
and that the reference is right there

1331
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,440
for whatever the extension is if there

1332
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,960
was one defined specifically for the

1333
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,960
automotive use case or whatever use case

1334
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,280
there is

1335
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,240
okay i see chris says thanks in the chat

1336
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,558
thank you

1337
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,240
but in that time

1338
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,319
there has not been anyone else joining

1339
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:03,280
the queue so i think

1340
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,839
it is time to say thank you everybody

1341
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,440
and

1342
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,319
give you some time back

1343
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:15,319
thanks so much everyone

1344
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,760
see y'all later bye
