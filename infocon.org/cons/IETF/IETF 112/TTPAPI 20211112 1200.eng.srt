9
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,920

i see we have a

29
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,440
little more than a couple dozen people

30
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,680
here

31
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:36,720
so

32
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,199
let's get started

33
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,040
uh by now many of you

34
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,360
will have seen i'll wait for the screen

35
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,000
to catch up

36
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,799
oh slow

37
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,600
oh dude

38
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,120
i am i'm

39
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
alexi says don't use the acme link

40
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,520
that's what's in the slides yeah um

41
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,000
that's okay i took notes for the rfc

42
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,800
editor and i added an extra letter

43
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,080
so we were also bifurcated across two

44
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,720
hedge doc docs

45
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,680
um

46
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,440
all right

47
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,720
is the screen

48
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,080
fully correct for anybody

49
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,280
i

50
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,880
seem to know well

51
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,840
no

52
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,639
no all right i think i think it works a

53
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,960
lot better if you use the slide share

54
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,320
instead of sharing your desktop

55
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,960
probably never having done that being

56
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,800
old school and all right that's why you

57
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,120
see the t-rex

58
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,880
luckily there's not much all right how

59
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,560
do i use the slide share go to the

60
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,720
share pre-loaded slides to the join view

61
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,840
button

62
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,159
yeah

63
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,120
all right stop sharing share slides

64
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
great okay

65
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,840
that was easy thank you meat echo

66
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,160
great okay

67
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,280
so

68
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,600
we're doing off to slightly so start yes

69
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,440
much better thank you martin all right

70
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,000
this is the note well many of you itf

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,720
folks will have seen this a dozen times

72
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,880
so far

73
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,880
pardon me

74
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,560
it's a reminder

75
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,720
of

76
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,840
the policies and practices for

77
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,000
intellectual property

78
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,400
contributing at the ietf a contribution

79
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,240
is speaking up

80
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,000
saying something writing on the mail

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,599
list

82
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,919
personal information we have a policy

83
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,400
privacy policy that we take very

84
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,360
strongly and try to

85
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,160
you know follow

86
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,800
second page of the note well

87
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,000
um

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,479
pardon my throat uh is links to the

89
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,840
documents

90
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,800
um as francesca pointed in the slides

91
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,280
that you can find as jessica pointed in

92
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,680
the chat you can find the slides

93
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
online there

94
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,560
which would make the links active

95
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,880
apparently next time around meet echo

96
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,240
will make links actually work for screen

97
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,680
sharing which

98
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,000
to me sounds pretty magical

99
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,120
one thing to know is the bcp

100
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,440
things if you haven't seen them

101
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,560
they are indirect references to rfcs bcp

102
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,400
9 in particular

103
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,120
means oh these following eight rfcs

104
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
uh maybe that'll get

105
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,400
updated at some point but anyhow

106
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,960
the current note well

107
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,840
um the note really well

108
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,000
pardon me

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,879
uh this session the iesg the technical

110
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,720
leadership of the ietf

111
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,879
um has really asked working chairs to

112
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,840
emphasize

113
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
more of the

114
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,680
soft skills

115
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,319
of being involved in the ietf

116
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,160
so treat colleagues with respect

117
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,039
speak slowly limit the use of slang it

118
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,120
tends to be

119
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,080
hard to follow if you speak

120
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,519
too quickly

121
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,599
or you use words that are you know not

122
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,000
well understood

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,479
uh if you have a dis disagreement about

124
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,760
ideas use judgment don't just say oh

125
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,519
that idea is stupid and how could you

126
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,279
have thought of it

127
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,959
um the goal is to use your best

128
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,959
engineering judgment and find a solution

129
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,080
that works

130
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,959
pardon me for the whole internet

131
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,920
certainly having things deployed shows

132
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,480
proof of concept at least

133
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,200
but it may not be applicable to everyone

134
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,480
and the goal here is really to get

135
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,399
everyone to contribute to the ongoing

136
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,720
work of this working group of all the

137
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,959
working groups and the ietf and whole

138
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,600
over as a whole

139
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,440
please keep these things in mind in mic

140
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,680
and messaging and chat rooms

141
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,839
that doesn't mean you have to be you

142
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,399
know boring engineers with no sense of

143
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,360
humor

144
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,200
but try not to make it personal

145
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,440
okay

146
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,839

150
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
make sure the video is off unless you're

151
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,880
sharing or presenting

152
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,560
that means daryl you can turn your video

153
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,080
back on

154
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,080
please mute your mic unless you're

155
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,279
speaking and the controls for all of

um

158
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,920
sure most of you aware by now are in the

159
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,080
upper left hand corner

160
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,600
just above the chat

161

dialogue on the left hand side

162
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,200
you're encouraged to use headset earbuds

163
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,839
and so on it tends to be a better sound

164
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,519
quality

165
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,760

generated by meat echo

168

when you sign into the video conference

169
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,440
you had to sign in with your

blue sheets are used to record

172
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,640
who attended those are used for planning

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,800
should we ever be able to go back to

177
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,079
that hopefully

178
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,079
um they are also have been used

179
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,440
periodically

180
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,720
when people sue the iatf about patents

181
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,480
oh so-and-so was here he never said

182
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
anything well here's the list that shows

183
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,640
they were there

184
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,560
but think of it mainly as

185
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,839
capacity planning for the future

186
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,560
chat rooms in meet echo the bar on the

187
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,079
left

188
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,000
are connected to the jabber chat rooms

189
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,600
that are listed in the data tracker

190
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,959
agenda

191
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,200
so if you go to dt.iatf.org

192
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,120
wg for working group slash http api

193
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,880
you can see the chat room

194
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,279
um there is a meet echo guide

195
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,240
it's

196
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,160
from the previous ietf session

197
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,760
obviously it's a little late to be

198
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,680
showing all this stuff now but we're

199
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,079
asked to

200
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,440
agenda

201
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,519
first part is administrative

202
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,920
um oh yeah acme

203
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,720
uh

204
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,240
the note well

205
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,079
that's the few pages that we just

206
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,279
covered uh minute taker braun has gwanda

207
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,040
has asked as offered to take minutes

208
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,920
um he'll be doing it at

209
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,240
notes.ihf.org notes ietf112 http api not

210
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,440
acme

211
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,279
obviously i was jet lagged in

212
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,120
anticipation of doing these slides

213
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,600
agenda bashing

214
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,480
in sec so look at the other bullets so

215
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,519
first we have an intro

216
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,760
a note well about a query method that's

217
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,880
happening in http bis

218
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,040
a discussion of linked templates other

219
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,200
document updates and then any other

220
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,040
business

221
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,639
does anyone else have things they would

222
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,800
like to add or shuffle around in the

223
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,279
agenda

224
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,399
okay

225
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,160
bang the gavel so it's noted

226
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,680
query method mark

227
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,519
you want to

228
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,519
talk

229
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,880
can you hear me

230
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,000
yes

231
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,200
excellent

232
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
um so this is just a

233
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,760
heads up uh about a draft that is in the

234
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,519
http working group

235
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,800
um

236
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,519
it's it's uh for a new http method

237
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,279
originally this was we were reusing the

238
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,639
search method

239
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,600
uh which was an old web dev method

240
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,560
but uh the most recent version of the

241
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,000
draft changes that for queer where we

242
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,120
thought that had a little bit better

243
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,760
ergonomics and uh

244
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,440
it was more clear that it wasn't just

245
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,959
for web dav

246
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,240
and so we're trying that out to see how

247
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,920
that goes and see if people like it and

248
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,600
and so this is a

249
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,720
new http method that is has similar

250
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,560
semantics to get in that it's safe and

251
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,639
item potential

252
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,959
but it allows you to put a

253
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,240
a request body on the get which http

254
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,920
either doesn't allow or extremely

255
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,600
strongly discourages

256
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,519
and we know that some people out there

257
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,079
are using gets with bodies because they

258
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,279
want certain attributes they don't want

259
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,199
to put some data in the url

260
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,279
or you know it it might be that the url

261
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,720
the data they want to send is really

262
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,320
long and they're not sure that

263
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,000
it's going to be url is that longer to

264
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,600
be handled and of course if you want to

265
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
put some kinds of data in a url it has

266
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,920
to be encoded and so for various reasons

267
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,600
people want to to do this but they still

268
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,920
want it to be for example cacheable they

269
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,160
want to they want those get semantics

270
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,000
and so this method is designed to kind

271
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,199
of fit that niche to allow a safe and

272
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,800
unpotent and cashable request

273
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,639
potentially cashable request to be

274
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,120
expressed with a body

275
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,839
um and and so uh the most recent version

276
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,560
we introduced uh

277
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,399
caching semantics for it uh to some

278
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,720
guidelines of how caches should treat it

279
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,560
uh we change from search to query as i

280
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,639
mentioned and and i'm talking about it

281
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,480
here because the the probably the

282
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,639
biggest use case for this method is

283
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,600
folks using http apis i know that i

284
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,920
think elasticsearch uses get with bodies

285
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,920
in this fashion and a few other folks do

286
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,160
too so if you

287
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,680
know of apis or you have apis that

288
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
need these semantics we'd really be keen

289
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,279
to have your feedback over in the http

290
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,680
working group because we'd like to make

291
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,120
sure that we're on the right track with

292
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,279
it

293
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,160
any questions

294
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,199
okay

295
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,600
maybe we should

296
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,959
get some initial feedback right now

297
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,599
mark can take back

298
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,839
so darrell said he prefers query over

299
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,440
search which fair enough

300
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,560
and eric says looks very useful

301
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,758
phil is absorbing the query

302
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,600
there are definitely lots of equals that

303
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,720
i work with but i could use this

304
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,360
in the forum as it's described

305
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,120
cool

306
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,360
phil

307
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,959
hey mark um

308
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,720
yes sorry i've just you know seen this

309
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,399
so just you know to say absorbing what

310
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,519
you just said

311
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,959
um

312
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,880
there's nothing here i i hope and

313
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,320
knowing you i'm sure it's true there's

314
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,880
nothing here that defines the format of

315
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,040
that query it's just i'm sending you a

316
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,000
query

317
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,600
here's some stuff that i'm hoping you

318
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,839
understand

319
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,839
right and this actually falls into a

320
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,360
similar pattern that we had with patch

321
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,199
we defined the patch method but we

322
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,839
didn't find it to find any patch formats

323
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,000
and so it you know uh

324
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,519
that was unfortunate especially for

325
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,120
patch people needed you know application

326
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,519
specific patch formats we eventually

327
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,880
came up with jason patch and a few

328
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,880
others came down the pike uh jason

329
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,680
margepachen and maybe one or two others

330
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
but uh um the question is whether we

331
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,320
need a common query format for this

332
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,800
method i tend to think that that's

333
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,399
probably out of scope for the http

334
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,399
working group just because a whole new

335
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,120
query language is you know

336
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,519
it's a pretty big undertaking and it has

337
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,120
a lot of application semantics kind of

338
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,320
in it you know there are different kinds

339
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,959
of constraints you might want to uh make

340
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,800
uh we're just giving you a method to do

341
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,279
that in um so uh

342
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,720
but it's a good question and certainly

343
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,199
if somebody comes up with a draft for a

344
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,959
standard and really interesting query

345
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,359
format um that's something i hope the

346
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,599
ietf would consider taking on yeah it

347
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,760
was it was really the fact that um in

348
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,439
the query string you have you know name

349
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,720
value pairs

350
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,679
here you've written a sql query so that

351
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,199
sort of indicates that well you're

352
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,199
thinking this is how you put this is how

353
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,959
you send a sql query which may or may

354
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,799
not be what you intended but that's the

355
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,320
impression i get by seeing something

356
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,880
that has a recognizable format

357
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,320
of your query

358
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,000
makes me think uh-huh this is what you

359
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,679
want to do

360
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,280
i didn't write this slide just to be

361
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,600
clear all right sorry you you in the

362
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,879
general you know tutor

363
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,440
um yeah the query could be anything it

364
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,360
could it could just be a you know name

365
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,799
value pairs you know in the in the

366
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,200
common query format that we we see

367
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,039
um i guess the interesting thing here is

368
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,440
is that it is kind of mirroring that

369
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
lack of definition in the uri query

370
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,640
string because although everybody in the

371
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,799
world seems to think that you know the

372
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,080
query

373
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,799
format in uris and httpr's is fixed to

374
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,440
you know key equals value and key equals

375
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
value and key value that's not true

376
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,520
that's standardized by html and specific

377
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,600
to html it's just that it became really

378
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,640
popular

379
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,600
um

380
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,360
and and so it could be the same thing

381
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,480
happens here maybe somebody will come up

382
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,360
with a great query format we don't know

383
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,720
thank you

384
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,760
thank you

385
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,679
i have a question so acme uses a concept

386
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,919
write post as get

387
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,320
right where we say oh we have to post

388
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,080
because we have content but it's really

389
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,240
intended to be you know more like a get

390
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,039
i wonder if

391
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,600
would query want to be generalized to

392
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,000
that or is it really intended to be

393
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,160
queries

394
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,360
um this is is

395
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,080
you know if we had a

396
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,000
better name that was more generic i

397
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,120
think we'd take it we were concerned

398
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,880
that search was too specific

399
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,799
um the the nice thing about query is is

400
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,799
that it mirrors the query string in a

401
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,799
uri and that's how often people are

402
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,000
using this

403
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,360
um they they just don't want to put it

404
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,400
in the query string they want to put in

405
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,240
the body and so that's kind of a hint

406
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,440
that hey if you could put the query

407
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,559
string and you want to put the body this

408
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,240
is the method you should use

409
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,240
um you know we could also call this

410
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,400
method get underscore with underscore

411
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,559
body if we really wanted to

412
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,799
um but you know

413
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:23,919
that's not the direction we took in the

414
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,440
current draft

415
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,280
okay i i'm not familiar enough with that

416
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,960
me to answer the question specifically

417
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,919
but it sounds like they could use it

418
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,679
all right yeah i mean you know if you

419
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:34,880
were

420
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,360
fat cat i like that

421
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,559
fact yeah

422
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,840
if get with if get with body makes

423
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,600
you know is not out of line then um

424
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,400
i'll mention this to the acme folks

425
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,400
sure

426
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,120
okay

427
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,880
oh that is a good idea thank you eric

428
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,960
can you possibly open an issue on the

429
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,720
repo for that eric

430
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,600
that'd be really helpful

431
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,840
thank you

432
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,120
okay any other comments questions

433
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,960
thank you mark for bringing it to our

434
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,559
attention

435
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,880
no worries

436
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,000
i think i'm next too

437
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,120
yes

438
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,480
oh thank you

439
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,679
i didn't have to make slides for this

440
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,080
one it's fantastic which is great

441
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,760
no daryl

442
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,840
daryl oh okay sorry daryl

443
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,600
daryl's great too

444
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,720
um

445
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,280
so uh this is a draft that i put

446
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,480
together a very long time ago

447
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,720
and it was just you know almost a

448
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,000
thought experiment

449
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,159
to say well you know the link header i

450
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,360
think it was around the time that we did

451
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,120
the link header the first time

452
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,960
in rfc 598

453
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,400
and uh

454
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,640
you know it's like well we have links in

455
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,320
in headers and we have this

456
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,120
framework to put links and headers

457
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,200
what you know why and then we had ui

458
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,640
template come along

459
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,840
which was uh

460
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,320
me and a few other folks roy and dave

461
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,440
and

462
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,720
someone else

463
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,039
we put together the ui template uh

464
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,080
format

465
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,120
and so this was just a thought

466
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,799
experiment to say well

467
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,400
you should probably be able to put

468
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,960
uri templates into links as well

469
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,440
into into headers so that you can

470
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,360
do interesting things and especially

471
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,720
since the web is supposed to be

472
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,799
generative you know this is that that's

473
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,480
a really nice property here that you can

474
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,159
convey the template for something and

475
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,320
then the client can generate new uris

476
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,480
based upon the information you give it

477
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,039
and so this was a an attempt to do that

478
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,039
and i very purposefully didn't push it

479
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,640
very hard i wanted to see if people were

480
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,400
interested before i you know did

481
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,960
anything with it i got a few sniffs of

482
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,880
interest over the years but but recently

483
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,600
it seems like i've seen a lot of people

484
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,200
come across and say oh that's something

485
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,039
i need or say can we have this without

486
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,400
realizing that this draft is already

487
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,799
there and so i guess the question is is

488
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,240
there enough interest to maybe pushed

489
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,000
across the line now

490
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,840
um i think there are a couple of open

491
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,559
issues in my repo about this

492
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,919
one of them being you know people have

493
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,440
asked what vera base is for and some

494
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,120
people are confused by another say that

495
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,880
could be useful so we probably need to

496
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,039
at least clarify something there

497
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,120
and and there i think the other big

498
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,760
issue if i remember correctly is that uh

499
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,039
it's a good question as to whether we

500
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,880
should use uh structured headers for

501
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,960
this or structured fields rather

502
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,159
rather than

503
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,320
duplicating the somewhat wonky link

504
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,919
syntax and and

505
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,600
increasing the amount of monkey headers

506
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,559
in the world

507
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,400
but um i guess the question right now is

508
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,679
not you know how to address those issues

509
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,960
the question is is there interest in

510
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,000
adopting this in the working group

511
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,280
thanks um

512
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,520
my point of view yes

513
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,919
i think this fits very well with what uh

514
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,760
we're doing with uh gs1 digital link um

515
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
i'm worrying you know especially in this

516
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,280
in this environment

517
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,799
god this is this is like being um

518
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,400
in lots of standards bodies we talk

519
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,240
about the

520
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,320
huge cultural differences

521
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,520
and the

522
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,440
fear that a lot of people have of

523
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,679
looking idiot in front of their peers so

524
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,320
with great trepidation right my in front

525
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,440
of you i'm going to make yourself look

526
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,960
an idiot

527
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,039
one of the link relation types we use in

528
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,080
our work

529
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,880
says don't ask me ask him in other words

530
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,640
a general redirect that says i know what

531
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,880
you want i understand what you want but

532
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,400
i'm not the person to ask go and ask

533
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,720
them and the link relation type we have

534
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,039
for that is called handled by

535
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,279
the query you're asking me is handled by

536
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,960
them over there

537
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,640
so i want to use this template to say

538
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,240
it's handled by them over there using

539
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,679
this template

540
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,600
is that the kind of use case that

541
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,960
you're going to cringe

542
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,960
at me for or am i okay with that

543
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,799
i i don't know enough about the

544
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,039
specifics but conceivably yeah you could

545
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,880
you know generate a uri over there to

546
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,080
you know and kind of pass some

547
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,240
information along with it um yeah so

548
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,039
that

549
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,039
you know that you you can possibly avoid

550
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,200
a round trip which is always nice right

551
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,640
that's what i'm trying to do yes exactly

552
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,159
yeah now that that sounds that sounds

553
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,240
quite reasonable okay that's really

554
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,919
thank you but yes certainly um this is

555
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,559
something i think we would

556
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,640
very very likely want to make use of

557
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,000
thank you yes

558
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,159
cool

559
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,880
i think the example that always comes to

560
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
mind for me for this is

561
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440
you're making a request for

562
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,760
something that returns a long list of

563
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,120
things

564
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,039
and you won't be able to have

565
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,480
links

566
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,200
construct links for off each of those

567
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,640
things

568
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,120
so rather than embedding link the like

569
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,039
basically duplicate links in every

570
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,720
single item in the list

571
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,640
this template would give you a way of

572
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,799
being able to generate links

573
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,840
um for any of the items in the list

574
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,320
and that avoids that common argument

575
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,960
where everybody says oh hypermedia but

576
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,240
think of the bytes over the wire

577
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,600
well helps mitigate it

578
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,039
who will think of the bytes

579
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,120
and is it fair to describe var base as

580
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,559
basically a way of

581
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,720
creating a unique globally unique

582
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,919
identifier for parameters and uri

583
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,120
templates

584
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,120
exactly it's a way to create a namespace

585
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,880
for them

586
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,480
i'm not sure that's the right solution

587
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,760
to that but it seemed like something

588
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,760
that might be useful to do because

589
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,360
otherwise how do i know what a widget id

590
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,719
is in this particular instance

591
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,840
chris please

592
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,480
i don't have a whole lot to add but um

593
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,520
uh

594
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,440
i think this work is useful i think the

595
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,000
problem is well scoped and worth doing

596
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,960
um

597
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,200
i support this particular approach

598
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,320
thank you

599
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,159
i guess the other merit of this is it's

600
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,240
pretty straightforward it's not like

601
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,799
this is a big speck

602
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,919
any other comments mark what is it you

603
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,120
are you

604
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,960
at the point where you think it's ready

605
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,720
for the group to consider adoption or

606
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,559
you just bring up

607
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,120
something back from the

608
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,880
work in progress

609
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,240
you could do a call for adoption if you

610
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,000
wanted to i think um

611
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,080
i could i'm happy to noodle away on it

612
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,240
but i'd rather get people's you know

613
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,600
feedback and make it part of an open

614
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,279
conversation rather than

615
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,380
me just continuing to noodle at it um

616
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,439
[Music]

617
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,919
so we heard some positive feedback we'll

618
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,679
confirm this on the mailing list but is

619
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,200
there anyone who thinks this is not

620
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,679
something the working group should adopt

621
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,360
and work on

622
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,000
speak up

623
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,679
martin raised the concern and the chat

624
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,399
the var base isn't straightforward i'd

625
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,600
agree with that i think there's some

626
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,640
some

627
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,159
interesting design decisions to be made

628
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,000
there there's a there's some subtlety in

629
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,159
there

630
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,880
okay

631
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,080
all right so

632
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,159
sounds like there's work to do which is

633
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,480
what we'd want and that the

634
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,679
folks here are in favor so we will

635
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,480
uh ron mark did it's movie put for call

636
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,080
for adoption in the minutes and we'll

637
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,799
confirm that on the list thank you mark

638
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,200
thank you

639
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,399
thanks mark

640
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,100
so

641
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,840
[Music]

642
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,080
i figured i'd slip eric's

643
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,158
stuff in here are you ready to go eric

644
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,120
because we can

645
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,039
go on to the other slides and come back

646
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,559
to you if you don't know there you go

647
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,440
okay

648
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,399
yes

649
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,080
i am

650
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,440
and i think the safest way might be to

651
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,480
just use can we use the uploaded or the

652
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,080
available slides

653
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,600
instead of me screen doing screen

654
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,360
sharing screen sharing

655
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,159
didn't look too great

656
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,360
i don't

657
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,039
i didn't see a pdf of your slides

658
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,679
oh i sent one too rich but um anyway

659
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,840
so in that case i'll do screen sharing

660
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,559
okay i missed it i apologize it doesn't

661
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,360
matter it's just because the last time

662
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,320
it was

663
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,120
not perfect

664
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,880
um

665
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,840
okay

666
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,179
[Music]

667
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
i do see

668
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,240
some

669
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,880
warnings basically

670
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,080
okay you should have it granted

671
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,520
okay

672
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,760
um

673
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,679
do you

674
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:50,559
all right

675
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,679
i don't see my screen being shared

676
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,240
or is it

677
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,039
um

678
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,120
you have to go on the

679
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,960
pre uh

680
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,440
share screen on the upper left after you

681
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,039
got permission

682
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,720
which you may have to stop sharing

683
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,120
before you can start

684
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,440
oh yeah okay there we go

685
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,279
that sounds reasonable

686
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,520
yep

687
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,639
thanks mike

688
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,480
okay

689
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,760
ah i think

690
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,640
yes okay

691
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,039
okay good

692
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,840
is it working

693
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,240
hello

694
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,519
see your screen you can see it okay

695
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,840
um okay so

696
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,679
let's go back i don't want to go through

697
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,679
all of it basically i just put all the

698
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,600
kind of history and the overview on

699
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,600
slides so link set

700
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,399
is that slide that hard fun sample and

701
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,159
myself we've been working on for a while

702
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,080
the idea

703
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,200
pretty simply said is to say

704
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,480
the

705
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,799
links that can be represented in a

706
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,080
link header field and http also

707
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,240
should be able to

708
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,519
be represented as as a resource as a

709
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,279
standalone resource

710
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,360
and we've been working on that for a

711
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,840
while we define two

712
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,600
media types one of them uses the syntax

713
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,760
of

714
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,760
rfc8288 which is the

715
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,640
normal syntax everybody is used to

716
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,600
for links in the http context

717
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,519
and the other one which took a little

718
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,279
bit more

719
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,640
creativity so to speak is a json based

720
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,039
representation which

721
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,720
is intended to represent the model of

722
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,120
rfc 8288 but does so in json so that

723
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,080
people use two processing json

724
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,880
and easier time processing those link

725
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,080
sets

726
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,679
and i again i won't go through all of

727
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,000
this i think we've seen that in previous

728
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,039
meetings

729
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,720
um

730
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,519
very

731
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,840
broadly speaking it looks like this this

732
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,399
is a json example so this is one of

733
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,720
these link sets in that case it has two

734
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,640
links in it two anchors link

735
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,399
relationships

736
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,679
of next and it's http example.com

737
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,760
relations buzz

738
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,399
and then two link targets

739
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,360
and

740
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,200
since we've working on that for a while

741
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,559
already there actually are

742
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,559
implementations out there

743
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,519
already

744
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,360
probably the biggest one

745
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,880
is gs1 the gs1 digital link spec

746
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,039
phil archer has been working with us on

747
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,600
that he's on this call as well

748
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,320
and they are using it already

749
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,159
which is why we're kind of a little bit

750
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,279
itching to get it stable so that they

751
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,559
can also

752
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,360
refer to a stable spec

753
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,679
and it also is being used in the fair

754
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,320
signposting profile specification for

755
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,039
scholarly resources which is around

756
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,120
having links for scholarly resources

757
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,159
which sometimes can be a lot of links

758
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,640
with references to papers or references

759
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,120
from papers and all of this then makes

760
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,279
more sense if you don't have to cram all

761
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:45,600
these things into an http header field

762
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,120
since the last meeting we have

763
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,440
produced a number of new versions

764
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,440
so we're currently kind of working on

765
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,080
our six but o5 is the one that's

766
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,120
currently

767
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,799
being published or

768
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,559
it's currently published

769
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,480
we have

770
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,360
addressed 26 issues

771
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,679
we have i think we have discussed all of

772
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,839
them appropriately at least we haven't

773
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,599
had any complaints that people said you

774
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,199
didn't address that

775
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,879
and we are at zero open issues so

776
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,960
in our mind we're actually looking

777
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,199
pretty good we had some discussions

778
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,040
already on the list we had very good

779
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,879
input from uh

780
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,719
mark um had a lot of input for us

781
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,800
and we had some other reviews i think

782
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,119
daryl also gave us a couple of inputs so

783
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,599
we did get i think a good set of inputs

784
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,320
from the community already and um

785
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,760
we think we've addressed them and then

786
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,399
currently we have no open issues

787
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,159
we have added a

788
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,119
couple of things so we added

789
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,839
support for profiles we also

790
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,079
added the ability to have newline

791
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,239
characters in the

792
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,918
in the syntax

793
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,240
that use the http header field syntax

794
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,760
because that makes

795
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,760
things a little bit more

796
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,760
readable better formatted and if you

797
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,800
have those as text files

798
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,560
we also worked a little bit on the

799
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,640
extensibility model that also were some

800
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,560
issues around that how that is and we

801
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,240
also had to

802
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,079
work a little bit on the json ld mapping

803
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,320
editorial updates

804
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,880
and where we are now is as i said we

805
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,400
have published version number five

806
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,359
of um this draft so we we have had many

807
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,440
more versions because we also have kind

808
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,839
of a history of transitioning between

809
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,760
different versions so overall we had 17

810
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
versions of that draft in the meantime

811
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,240
so it has been around for quite a while

812
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,560
and that's about it so so the one thing

813
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,400
that is still open but that is not

814
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,359
really

815
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,640
i would say something that is

816
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,440
specific to our specification but with

817
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,040
the json ld mapping the problem is that

818
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,240
if you map

819
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,640
what else json lc does for those of you

820
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,880
who don't know it so well jason ld

821
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,880
defines a way how you

822
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,760
take

823
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,680
json representation and basically turn

824
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,839
it into rdf

825
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,160
and and we can do that but the problem

826
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,960
is

827
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,079
that if you do this for this example

828
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,160
then if you have

829
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,040
link relation types that are

830
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,400
ietf registered link relation types then

831
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,640
these are just strings and they're not

832
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,240
like right so the extension link

833
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,040
relation types are these uris which is

834
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,320
something that rdf can work with

835
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,119
but

836
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,280
the registered link relation types are

837
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,280
just strings

838
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,760
and that means that it is a problem to

839
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,000
turn that into a proper rdf model

840
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,320
because rdf is realistically constrained

841
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,079
and what it can deal with as identifiers

842
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,240
because identifiers always have to be

843
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,680
your eyes

844
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,440
and in that case the identifier is not a

845
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,920
uri it's just a string so that is the

846
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,160
one kind of open issue it's not

847
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,320
technically an open issue for the github

848
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,400
repo but that's the one issue that we

849
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,040
still have with json ld

850
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,240
but as i said there is nothing in my

851
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,079
mind that you can easily do about that

852
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,720
because that's just kind of an

853
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,800
incompatibility of how

854
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,680
the mechanism works for links with with

855
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,480
these strings as registered values and

856
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,599
with what json ld needs as identifiers

857
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,359
which are your eyes and these two things

858
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,800
just

859
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,119
fit together but apart from that apart

860
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,079
from that um we're done i'll

861
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,240
stop sharing my screen here

862
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,280
um

863
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,960
so yeah that's the status on link set so

864
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,280
as i said we are at

865
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,320
zero open issues so we think

866
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,359
and hope

867
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,280
that this at some point we can really

868
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,960
turn this into uh something where

869
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,800
everybody says okay this is ready to

870
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,000
become a specification

871
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,880
yeah that's awesome to see that you're

872
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,359
down to zero issues and i don't see any

873
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,400
reason why

874
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,160
yes

875
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,879
published before

876
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,040
you just lock it down

877
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,440
no this is great to see

878
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,320
um

879
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,400
then i will i will let rich

880
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,320
guide me through the process of how we

881
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,400
take next steps

882
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,480
on that

883
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,640
i believe that these go on list there's

884
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,400
the last call right

885
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,760
right so

886
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,440
um

887
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,119
i see phil's commented that it's

888
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,079
currently implemented by

889
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,960
the sacrifice of goat no mark

890
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,119
we don't do that anymore the ietf's new

891
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,560
rules are vegans um so uh

892
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,400
okay so the process is

893
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,160
first of all thanks eric

894
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,800
and others for your patience often the

895
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,119
way things work right like probably most

896
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,440
of life ietf is deadline driven

897
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,599
so someone says here's my new draft and

898
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,200
i think it's all done and then people

899
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,560
come out of the woodwork and they make a

900
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,760
whole bunch of corrections or

901
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,839
suggestions issues that have to be dealt

902
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:04,640
with

903
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,160
um

904
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,839
what will happen now

905
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,839
i'm assuming everyone isn't you know

906
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,520
everyone here is in favor of the working

907
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,320
group last call

908
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,079
we will issue on the list a working

909
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,320
group last call we'll decide you know

910
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,040
it's typically one or two weeks

911
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,839
um

912
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,040
and then

913
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,280
uh what happened that's

914
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,960
sort of a last-minute chance for people

915
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,040
to say oh this

916
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,800
this issue i just thought of this issue

917
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,920
now

918
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,200
um

919
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,880
okay sean we'll do two weeks so we'll do

920
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,560
a two-week last call yeah especially

921
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,720
because it's getting

922
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,599
into the us thanksgiving holidays

923
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,839
um so we do a working group last call

924
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,359
this is the last chance for the working

925
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,480
group

926
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,839
quote unquote last chance for the

927
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,079
working group to make substantive

928
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,520
changes

929
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,839
and

930
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,440
then what will happen is our

931
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,400
we will have a document shepard

932
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,280
picked

933
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,880
i'll explain that in a sec

934
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,119
i guess it makes sense with the goats

935
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,359
and our responsible area director will

936
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,119
take a look at the document and they

937
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,400
will give their feedback it's francesca

938
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,960
who is in the chat

939
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,079
francesca

940
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,440
halumba

941
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,480
saying her last name wrong um

942
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,400
the shepherd writes up in essence a

943
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,319
history of how it's been the discussion

944
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,880
that's thank you francesca palombini

945
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,680
okay

946
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
sorry uh

947
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,800
writes up

948
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,200
history there is a format to follow you

949
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,359
know what is the intended use of this

950
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,599
it's a proposed standard

951
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,160
the discussions

952
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,760
there weren't any

953
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,760
notably difficult discussions the

954
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,440
working group is in favor of this it's

955
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,359
already being implemented as i said

956
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,200
there's a format of it

957
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,760
and then after francesca has approved it

958
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,200
it will get put

959
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,960
on the iesg addenda agenda

960
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,599
it will also go to ietf last call

961
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,520
where the whole ietf gets a chance to

962
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,000
look at it

963
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,920
assuming all of those pass

964
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,960
or pass without substantive comments

965
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,480
then it gets put on the queue for

966
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,079
publication

967
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,000
publication is currently running a

968
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,240
couple of months

969
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,720
then the most important thing

970
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,720
is uh

971
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,480
you get to what's called auth 48

972
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,480
which is

973
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,480
48 hours 48 days 48 weeks depending

974
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,240
where the rfc editor looks at it and

975
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,640
they make

976
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,480
editorial nitpicky suggestions

977
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,440
um hey you said was and you should say

978
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,280
where or things like that it's it's

979
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,000
really english language wordsmithing

980
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,760
um

981
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,000
and

982
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,599
then it gets published

983
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,400
but the point is once it leaves once the

984
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,200
iesg approves it and the less ietf less

985
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,520
call has happened um then the boss the

986
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,040
document is basically done and you can

987
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,640
say this is now in the queue to be

988
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,480
published as an rfc

989
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,960
that last process takes you know

990
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,280
given the holiday year end season the

991
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,760
isg might be a little slower than we

992
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,400
than usual um and the

993
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
publication system is

994
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,160
they're back up to their normal speed

995
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,680
now having

996
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,640
gotten over the xml v3 conversion pump

997
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,040
so it should be fairly straightforward

998
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,960
any questions about the process

999
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,960
what i will do is i will probably write

1000
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,480
this up as this i'll probably do the

1001
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,160
shepherd write up it gets attached to

1002
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,760
the data tracker so people can see

1003
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,520
what's involved

1004
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,400
and consider doing it for other

1005
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,280
documents as they come to our system

1006
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,720
it's

1007
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,040
very common that the chairs are the ones

1008
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,720
who do the write-up because they have to

1009
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,800
summarize what's happened in the working

1010
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,680
group and how they feel

1011
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:07,839
all right

1012
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,560
we will issue this as a last call

1013
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,359
um thanks for the offer eric i will

1014
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,599
probably post a draft of the shepherd

1015
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,079
write-up to the working group after the

1016
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,119
last call has passed

1017
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:21,920
uh

1018
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,880
so

1019
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,240
there's two questions

1020
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,319
just a very brief question so so we did

1021
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,520
start version six um

1022
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,160
which has i think super minor editorial

1023
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,400
changes but should i then um publish

1024
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,880
that one so that we have kind of the

1025
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,720
latest and greatest version out before

1026
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,280
you do the writer

1027
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,720
sure why don't you

1028
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,680
yes

1029
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,920
do that and then we'll when you publish

1030
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,280
that one then we'll say this is the one

1031
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,720
we're going for last call just has

1032
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,280
editorial changes

1033
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,280
okay will do thank you

1034
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,440
thank you

1035
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,560
all right great that's uh

1036
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,319
well first with the slides and first and

1037
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,960
to last call

1038
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,960
i figured we'd start on a positive note

1039
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,119
yeah

1040
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,760
thanks for the explanation rich okay so

1041
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,720
um if we want to slide to the next slide

1042
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,920
uh what i did is i took each of the the

1043
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,520
documents that are currently going

1044
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,079
through the working group and went to

1045
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,720
the github issues and found what

1046
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,560
appeared to be the most contentious

1047
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,119
issues so that we could just

1048
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,960
surface them here and get any other

1049
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,960
conversation and encourage folks to go

1050
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,880
to those get up issues if they have

1051
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,280
strong opinions um

1052
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,040
looking at rfc 7807 biz

1053
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,400
uh the two main issues that seem to be

1054
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,319
attracting the most attention

1055
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,720
was this conversation around how to

1056
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,880
integrate warnings

1057
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,560
uh and

1058
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,800
there seems to be two distinct threads

1059
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,800
of conversation uh one which is

1060
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,599
around well how do i describe a

1061
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:06,880
use the

1062
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,119
hp problem to describe what is actually

1063
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,480
a warning

1064
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,200
and the other being

1065
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,200
well yeah i want to do a regular request

1066
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,960
that comes back with a response but also

1067
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,839
attach a warning and i believe

1068
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,319
the um

1069
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,400
the latter

1070
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,200
uh

1071
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,160
suggestion or the latter issue we are

1072
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,839
punting to

1073
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,040
uh

1074
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,920
either a future spec or a separate spec

1075
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,640
but i will let mark speak to that as he

1076
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,520
jumped into the queue

1077
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,880
yeah i i just um closed this one uh

1078
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,400
because the the

1079
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,079
conversation seemed to conclude that

1080
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,040
that would

1081
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,200
be okay um if if we need to reopen it

1082
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,040
that's fine it just that seems like the

1083
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,200
date we were in so

1084
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,079
yep that's that's how i read it

1085
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,040
um

1086
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,319
the the second issue is the uh

1087
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,319
multiple problems

1088
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,839
um and

1089
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:08,880
uh i believe sanjay has created a pr

1090
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,920
based on a suggestion that was made in

1091
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,119
the thread

1092
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,440
that says uh

1093
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,480
it's a certain type of error that has

1094
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,800
the potential for multiple reasons why

1095
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,280
it occurred within single request

1096
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,920
and that describes

1097
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,200
that uses the extension capabilities of

1098
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,119
hp problem

1099
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,680
to list out a set of causes

1100
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,079
um this wouldn't if i understand

1101
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,440
correctly this isn't actually

1102
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,920
uh won't need to actually be part of the

1103
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,920
spec itself it's just using the natural

1104
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,240
extension mechanisms of the spec is that

1105
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,640
correct

1106
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,119
mark

1107
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,520
so i think the place we ended up here

1108
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,480
was that we decided to to document some

1109
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,560
more examples in the spec

1110
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,680
at least one if not more than one uh to

1111
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,960
uh

1112
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,240
kind to illustrate how this could be

1113
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,640
done uh and and what the parameters are

1114
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,599
around it

1115
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,040
so um

1116
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,960
i think you know it in some ways it's

1117
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,960
very similar to the stuff we did for the

1118
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,640
most recent draft we

1119
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,559
you know clarified and kind of explained

1120
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,079
and gave examples of stuff that was

1121
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,920
already there it just wasn't adequately

1122
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,079
communicated uh in 7807 and so uh i

1123
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,040
think that's the direction we're going

1124
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,559
to go in i know that that sanjay has a

1125
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,480
pull request that he's been working on

1126
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,240
that i think he's getting closer to to

1127
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,079
being ready to merge so i think we just

1128
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,160
need to continue discussing that it's a

1129
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,400
little delicate because

1130
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,079
if you make the the examples too

1131
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,920
realistic then people might just use

1132
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,400
those as templates almost you know and

1133
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,559
cut and paste from the spec which may or

1134
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,520
may not be a good thing uh so

1135
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,880
uh we don't want to invent new

1136
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,480
mechanisms necessarily there that are

1137
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,559
just for the purpose of an example

1138
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,960
uh so i think we just need to

1139
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,319
keep on working on that and i think

1140
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,839
we'll get to a pretty good place

1141
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,520
i see sanjay's here i don't know if he

1142
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,240
wants to say anything

1143
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,480
eric is in queue

1144
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,440
eric you want to go first

1145
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,839
okay yeah thanks yeah so i basically

1146
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,359
just wanted to

1147
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,319
kind of support what mark said right so

1148
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,839
right now i think the state is that we

1149
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,839
have this example and it looks like an

1150
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,520
actual mechanism but it's not quite

1151
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,440
clear whether it's just an example or an

1152
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,359
action mechanism and i think we

1153
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,520
in my mind we have to go

1154
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,359
either one way or the other but some in

1155
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,280
the middle is not it's not great right

1156
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,960
because then people like mark said they

1157
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,280
might think this is an actual thing

1158
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,280
but it isn't and then we end up with

1159
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,480
this kind of everybody uses that however

1160
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,079
they think it works i think that would

1161
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,599
be the worst case scenario for us

1162
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,119
and just be clear i cut and pasted this

1163
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,280
example from sanjay's

1164
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,960
pr and my understanding was this was

1165
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,200
purely an example of how you might use

1166
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,119
that causes is not

1167
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,760
uh an official part of the spec but

1168
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,280
sanjay you want to

1169
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,680
take that

1170
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,839
yeah so thanks

1171
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,880
it is an example and uh

1172
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,480
i can

1173
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,319
based on the comments i can

1174
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,800
put some more words

1175
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,640
cautioning that it is

1176
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,040
an example for an extension it doesn't

1177
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,920
look like the swag is saying that but as

1178
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,440
mark was saying we had to give an

1179
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,520
example that's what

1180
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,079
we agreed on so i think

1181
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,599
we can

1182
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,680
do a couple of things one is the example

1183
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,440
for the

1184
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,000
multiple problems and i think

1185
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,400
where more comments are is

1186
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,079
a second example which is uh

1187
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,640
using json pointer

1188
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,400
to point to a a problem in the request

1189
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,440
itself

1190
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,400
i think that needs a bit more

1191
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,400
uh

1192
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,359
review

1193
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,640
it appears

1194
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,558
so looking forward to those comments

1195
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,800
thanks sanja mark

1196
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,480
here i think one of the things that came

1197
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,000
up in the discussion

1198
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,599
was the difference you know they're

1199
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,760
different kinds of classes of multiple

1200
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,880
problems

1201
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,119
and and one is that

1202
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,160
uh

1203
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,040
you

1204
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,200
might have you know multiple instances

1205
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,680
of the same problem type

1206
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,559
um

1207
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:45,680
excuse me

1208
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,200
and in that case

1209
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,079
um

1210
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,920
you know it's it's

1211
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,599
probably the you know the type that's

1212
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,079
here in this example the multiple errors

1213
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,240
is is not ideal what you would really

1214
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,240
want to do is is that have you know the

1215
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,800
the valid validation error type allow

1216
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,920
multiple

1217
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,160
instances to be you know communicated of

1218
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,760
where it is in the document

1219
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,000
um so so it's you know not so generic at

1220
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,680
the top level type

1221
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,280
another example would be what you see

1222
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,000
here which is there are multiple

1223
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,920
different uh uh

1224
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,880
problem

1225
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,720
types in the document

1226
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,839
and

1227
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,119
you need to convey them all at the same

1228
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,480
time you don't want to just convey the

1229
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,760
first one they have the person make the

1230
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,440
request and convey the second one and so

1231
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,359
forth and in that case you do need this

1232
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,800
this multiple errors type but but

1233
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,800
there's there's two different kinds of

1234
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,480
of

1235
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,319
two different ways this can happen

1236
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,400
one is where all the different problem

1237
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,920
types although

1238
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,800
they uh are different problem types they

1239
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,720
have the same recommended http status

1240
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,040
code uh for example maybe it's a you

1241
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,079
know 400 which is quite common

1242
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,599
uh it you know it things with

1243
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:50,640
something's wrong with the request and

1244
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,160
hear the details of that

1245
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,839
and in that case you should use that

1246
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:56,960
status code the only time that you

1247
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,520
should use 207 multi-status

1248
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,720
is when

1249
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,960
there are multiple problem types true

1250
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,559
you know you have this multiple errors

1251
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,640
case that we're coming up with

1252
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,680
and uh

1253
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,920
they have incompatible recommended http

1254
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,760
status codes and so

1255
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,000
you need some way to you know convey

1256
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,119
that

1257
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:19,119
one example would be to use 207 multi

1258
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:20,640
status

1259
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,480
but i would say that even if they're all

1260
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,599
400 4xx status codes for example you'd

1261
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,119
probably send it as 400 because that's

1262
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,000
the most generic for xxx status code and

1263
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,599
so i think we need to have some more

1264
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,680
nuanced guidance here about these

1265
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,000
multiple status cases and i'm i'm really

1266
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,240
happy to write text about that i just

1267
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,680
wanted to to while we have the

1268
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,520
opportunity to do this quote unquote

1269
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,359
face-to-face or at least as face-to-face

1270
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,079
as we can be in 2021

1271
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,359
that it'd be good to kind of talk

1272
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,520
through those different cases

1273
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,640
if that makes sense to folks

1274
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,160
sanjay

1275
00:52:58,319 --> 00:52:59,680
i think

1276
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,079
i was uh

1277
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,880
when i i wrote this i was wondering how

1278
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,319
many examples at that early section that

1279
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,960
we should write so i i kind of

1280
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,200
tried to combine these two but i agree

1281
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,880
with my mark

1282
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,160
that we can

1283
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,200
have

1284
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,880
separate examples

1285
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:23,200
this was on the top in the earlier

1286
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,240
draft

1287
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,160
so i thought

1288
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,280
maybe introduce these things right there

1289
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,480
but uh we can introduce them in

1290
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,000
uh proper sequence like you just have

1291
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,480
one type of error give example of that

1292
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,079
and if you have

1293
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,839
cases like uh different kinds of errors

1294
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:46,400
then and 207 could be used and that

1295
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,559
would be a separate example so

1296
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:49,760
mark uh

1297
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,440
yeah feel free to uh

1298
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,760
have an update on that

1299
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,480
no no that that sounds good and um

1300
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,960
i'm totally with you i i'm not a fan at

1301
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,480
all of specs that are just big walls of

1302
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,839
examples that you have to fight your way

1303
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,920
through um so if we can find a way to

1304
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,839
balance that to convey the nuance here

1305
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:08,800
without

1306
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,720
you know having too many examples i

1307
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,079
think that would be a good goal to have

1308
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:14,240
here

1309
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,040
excellent well i could only fit so many

1310
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,880
examples on the slide and this one look

1311
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,720
this particular example looked like it

1312
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,839
would provoke conversation so

1313
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,920
i'm glad it did

1314
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,079
uh are there any other items uh on 7807

1315
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,640
biz that uh you believe are

1316
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,079
[Music]

1317
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,559
would benefit from further participation

1318
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,799
mark

1319
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:43,680
that you want to call attention to

1320
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,079
i think the the multiple you know since

1321
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:47,440
before we started this the multiple

1322
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,000
problems was clearly the the most

1323
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,839
um

1324
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:53,520
impactful potential change um the ld

1325
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,599
jason ld context i think we we probably

1326
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:56,480
need a

1327
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,440
a proposal for that i think ashborne uh

1328
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,480
volunteered to do that if i remember

1329
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,520
correctly

1330
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,720
um

1331
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,040
the uh 32 the extension to show source

1332
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,720
of problem and request for exact class

1333
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,040
of errors i think that's just kind of a

1334
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,280
part of the example you know processing

1335
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,640
and getting that right

1336
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,200
so we'll get there um

1337
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,640
i think the other question that's kind

1338
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,200
of been the back of our heads is

1339
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,440
do we want to standardize any uh

1340
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,520
register with the so the last

1341
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,400
uh

1342
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,960
revision we introduced the idea of a

1343
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,160
registered problem type still a uri but

1344
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,440
it's it's in a registry to kind of

1345
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,440
promote good practice and so forth and i

1346
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,119
guess the question is do we want to go

1347
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,040
to the effort to define any of those

1348
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,680
like you know the multiple errors or a

1349
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,440
validation error problem

1350
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,319
um and i think that's um something we

1351
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:49,359
could do

1352
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,760
i i do think that that's you know not a

1353
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,440
trivial design task it would take some

1354
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,599
time but it's you know we

1355
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,040
so there's i guess the decision do we

1356
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,799
want to try and put any in this document

1357
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,880
or do we want to punt that to to maybe a

1358
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,960
follow-up document and i i don't have

1359
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,400
strong feelings that's something we

1360
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,280
should

1361
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,280
do with purpose

1362
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,599
either way

1363
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:20,720
excellent

1364
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,720
well if there's no other comments on

1365
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,920
this draft we could move on to

1366
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,799
the next one

1367
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:31,680
which i may have to wave my hands a

1368
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,400
little uh because uh roberto i don't

1369
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,960
believe is in the call

1370
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,359
um

1371
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,839
the rate limit headers uh

1372
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,359
they the

1373
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:47,839
roberto did publish a new update to this

1374
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:51,119
uh document just a few days ago

1375
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,440
uh the items that are

1376
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,480
seem to be the most popular

1377
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,599
uh of this conversation around

1378
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,480
naming of the headers at the moment

1379
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,520
there is

1380
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,839
rate limit dash limit rate limit dash

1381
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,119
remaining a rate limit dash reset

1382
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:14,240
um i know mark has suggested that maybe

1383
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,520
shortening those to rl dash uh

1384
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,359
there is a

1385
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,240
interesting conversation about

1386
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,559
compatibility

1387
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:27,599
with existing deployments because this

1388
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,040
spec is as much as anything is a an

1389
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,839
attempt to standardize what is current

1390
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:34,960
practice

1391
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,680
um but the current practice starts with

1392
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,440
x dash so

1393
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,119
it's going to break compatibility anyway

1394
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:45,599
which then opens the door of well well

1395
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,480
why not rename the fields as well so

1396
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,960
if you have opinions on that particular

1397
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,640
topic there is an issue open there

1398
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,760
throttling scope uh

1399
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,440
is an interesting conversation that

1400
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,599
there was a discussion

1401
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:06,480
um i believe in the hp working group

1402
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,880
around whether retry after

1403
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,200
should have any scope qualifications and

1404
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,240
it was

1405
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,319
that it that

1406
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:15,599
did not

1407
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,599
lead to anything other than

1408
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:19,680
clarification

1409
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,559
around retry after i believe

1410
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,880
here because there is a lot of

1411
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,000
flexibility around determining

1412
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,160
um

1413
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,079
quota policies

1414
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,720
there is an opportunity to define scope

1415
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,200
and what's meant by that is

1416
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,200
is uh is are you being throttled for

1417
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,040
just this particular resource are you

1418
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,880
being throttled for

1419
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,200
all of these resources for your company

1420
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,280
are you being throttled for

1421
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,520
just this particular mailbox or this

1422
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,520
particular website

1423
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,400
um so there there i believe the

1424
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,960
extensibility mechanism is is going to

1425
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,720
be able to address this

1426
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,280
uh with quota policies but uh there's

1427
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,960
definitely a conversation worth having

1428
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,760
there

1429
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,079
mark

1430
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,680
just on that um

1431
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,599
in my experience scoping the

1432
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:15,839
applicability of a header is one of the

1433
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,440
worst things

1434
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,160
to to leave out well no no that that's

1435
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,520
not true sometimes it makes sense to

1436
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,000
leave it out but if it's left out and

1437
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,240
and it's ambiguous it can be really

1438
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,160
pernicious to figure out down the road

1439
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,079
and we you know for retry after we

1440
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,559
didn't define it because it's already in

1441
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:34,640
deployment and it's undefined so we

1442
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,680
can't just

1443
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,760
define it by fiat and break some people

1444
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,799
you know and their idea of how it

1445
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:40,640
applies um

1446
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,599
so

1447
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:42,880
if

1448
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,240
you know

1449
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,319
to me the the intuitive thing to do here

1450
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:49,040
would be to not define a static scope

1451
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,200
but to say that the scope is undefined

1452
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,880
but also to define maybe a vocabulary of

1453
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,480
scopes that people can apply and say

1454
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,440
well this is scoped just to this

1455
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,119
resource or this a scope to this entire

1456
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,680
site or you know carve out the right

1457
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,760
kinds of of uh primitives that people

1458
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,200
can use to declare this if they want to

1459
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,759
declare it

1460
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,160
yep that seems to be the direction that

1461
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,599
is is

1462
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:15,440
being headed to in that particular

1463
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,839
thread

1464
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,799
uh

1465
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,000
the

1466
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,160
define header dependencies is uh an

1467
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,559
issue that talks about

1468
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:29,599
um

1469
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,359
do you need to provide all three rate

1470
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,000
limit rate remaining rate reset

1471
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,839
uh are there interdependencies can you

1472
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:38,400
define one but not another

1473
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,200
uh

1474
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:44,319
and that conversation is ongoing

1475
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,130
um

1476
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:46,640
[Music]

1477
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,480
the last item is related uh in two ways

1478
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,280
it's

1479
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,760
it is uh an extension to the

1480
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,359
standardized behavior

1481
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:58,240
and

1482
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,480
refers to the use of

1483
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,480
a

1484
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,799
structured field header list

1485
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:07,680
as opposed to

1486
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,079
it's currently using a list because you

1487
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:13,520
can apply multiple uh

1488
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,280
quotas you can say

1489
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,760
in the next 10 minutes you can make 100

1490
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,000
requests in the next hour you can make

1491
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,599
10 000 requests so you can define

1492
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:23,680
multiple but that is again not

1493
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,359
compatible with

1494
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:29,040
um the existing implementations and so

1495
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:32,000
there's questions around capability

1496
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,280
compatibility with the past

1497
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,599
so if you have thoughts but don't want

1498
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,200
to bring them up here please go to

1499
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,400
github and

1500
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,119
add your thoughts there

1501
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,319
and if there are no other comments we

1502
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:58,558
can

1503
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,839
move on to the next

1504
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,000
oh wait um are you back in the key mark

1505
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,799
or

1506
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:10,160
still in the queue from previously

1507
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,880
oh he's gone

1508
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,720
uh

1509
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,240
defecation header um

1510
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,920
eric do you want to speak to

1511
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,240
these

1512
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,920
or do you want me to sure yeah i can um

1513
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,599
thanks daryl

1514
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,319
yeah so this one um we actually we have

1515
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:39,920
not um produced a new version since the

1516
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,200
last meeting

1517
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,200
um we had we had a couple of open issues

1518
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,640
still so

1519
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,520
we have not been i would say super good

1520
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,880
at closing all of these um

1521
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,359
as i said there is no new version of the

1522
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:56,559
draft

1523
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,480
mostly i think i would like to encourage

1524
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,000
everybody to

1525
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,920
look at the draft if you're not aware of

1526
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,000
it it's very simple one it's very

1527
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,839
similar to the sunset

1528
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:08,799
mechanism that already is an rfc or

1529
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,799
deprecation is a header field but you

1530
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:13,839
can say this resource still works

1531
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,480
but it's deprecated so you should think

1532
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,280
about alternatives it may get shut down

1533
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,559
all these kind of things it's a very

1534
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:22,079
simple mechanism

1535
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,960
and it can either say this is deprecated

1536
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,599
or this is going to be deprecated with a

1537
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,039
date in the future

1538
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:33,359
one of the i think most contentious

1539
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:36,400
issues we had around this was this

1540
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,200
question of um

1541
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,640
scope so is deprecation always just for

1542
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,160
the resource where you say this whole

1543
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,400
resource will become deprecated or is

1544
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,200
there some kind of more fine-grained

1545
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,680
model i think we still might have some

1546
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:52,960
um

1547
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,440
some issues around that i'm not quite

1548
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,640
sure to be honest i know that daryl

1549
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,280
has his own opinions about that

1550
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,839
taking off my chair

1551
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,880
i i think you've made a good case for

1552
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,200
um

1553
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,599
there's value to just keeping it focused

1554
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:13,760
at the resource level

1555
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,960
um

1556
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,799
i'll have to go back to our team and say

1557
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:19,119
hey that header that i suggested you

1558
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:20,160
using

1559
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,400
you're not using it for the right way

1560
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,640
and find some other way of doing it but

1561
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,039
i am i i

1562
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:28,559
i think we're getting close to being

1563
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:31,359
able to close that one

1564
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,440
with no action

1565
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,440
okay that's good to you

1566
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,599
so the point being there i think that if

1567
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:39,359
you think about partial deportation you

1568
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:41,520
want to point to particular things that

1569
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,839
are deprecated or are going to be

1570
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:46,000
deprecated you kind of need to have a

1571
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,839
model how to do that or it doesn't make

1572
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:49,760
a lot of sense to do it

1573
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,599
and and then that

1574
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:54,480
that goes pretty quickly very deep into

1575
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,400
the realm of the representation that

1576
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,000
you're sending because you somehow need

1577
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,680
to talk about that

1578
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,000
and since this is an http header field

1579
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,200
um we're not really kind of

1580
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,520
intending to go to that level

1581
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,400
okay

1582
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,680
so

1583
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,400
martin has a question in the chat um to

1584
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,400
answer your question why

1585
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,160
says retry after has an ambiguous scope

1586
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,839
why this not also

1587
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:21,200
this scope is not scope as in how many

1588
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:25,039
resources did this apply to it the the

1589
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:27,440
the desire was to be able to have the

1590
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,839
deprecation header say there is

1591
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:33,039
something inside this response this

1592
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:35,520
representation that has been deprecated

1593
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,720
the entire resource isn't going away but

1594
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,079
one of the data elements within it

1595
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:43,599
is uh

1596
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:45,839
is being deprecated

1597
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:48,160
so it's it's wanting a much more

1598
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,760
fine-grained

1599
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,359
than with than a resource

1600
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,440
okay it seems like the comments are

1601
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,880
mostly about retry after so

1602
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,280
you don't have to worry about that um

1603
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,079
yeah so that one um then the question

1604
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:09,760
was yeah can you redirect to a new

1605
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,920
location

1606
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,359
there was just a conversation as to

1607
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:15,599
whether or not this was a a valid

1608
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:18,640
example and and i think they the issue

1609
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,799
was tending towards yes this is a valid

1610
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,280
example

1611
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,720
yeah

1612
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,599
and then i so that number 12 that you're

1613
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,760
i think that one was raised by mark if i

1614
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,240
recall correctly uh

1615
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,240
saying that it's just not not such a

1616
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,480
great design um

1617
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,000
to do it like that

1618
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,200
and i

1619
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,599
to be honest i don't i haven't thought

1620
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,440
so i think my main

1621
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,680
point was that i agree that maybe is not

1622
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,520
a great design but that's how sunset

1623
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,760
works

1624
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,599
so it's a design out there in the wild

1625
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:53,839
and we could either mirror that design

1626
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:55,680
which at least was the starting point

1627
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,520
for that or we could say okay there's a

1628
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,599
better way to do that but then then it

1629
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:02,400
works differently

1630
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:06,000
mark this one

1631
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,559
uh just waiting to there it is um yeah

1632
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,200
if i remember correctly in the semantics

1633
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,960
revision we documented that as a bad

1634
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,720
practice always at least if julian got

1635
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:17,920
his way we did

1636
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:18,960
so

1637
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,680
it it causes ambiguities it causes

1638
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,759
parsing difficulties and just yeah

1639
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,920
yeah i mentioned in the chat that

1640
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,079
because sanjay called out well

1641
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:33,359
this is this is uh open api uses

1642
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,680
deprecated as a boolean and

1643
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,520
i think mark was suggesting why not just

1644
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,760
use just a date and if the date is in

1645
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,000
the past then consider it true and i

1646
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,079
wish we'd done that in open api so

1647
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:46,960
please don't use open api as a model to

1648
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,839
start to follow

1649
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,960
for this particular thing

1650
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:56,559
you know right now we're using sunset

1651
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:58,880
right which does that so

1652
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,000
and uh

1653
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,480
i haven't heard um any specific

1654
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,240
complaints about that but i agree that

1655
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,559
it's probably not the best design and we

1656
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:08,640
have a chance to make it

1657
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,119
easier to work with so

1658
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:12,559
um yeah so i think it's a good

1659
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:14,559
suggestion but we still have to address

1660
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:15,599
that

1661
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:18,000
um

1662
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,040
i was just thinking that you know the

1663
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,600
api developers were writing the

1664
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,880
contracts

1665
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,439
uh not to confuse them too much if there

1666
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,399
is some

1667
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,799
um

1668
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:36,719
between the open api spike or you know

1669
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,880
even we have been discussing with async

1670
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,479
api also and the http header but i agree

1671
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:44,640
you know i'm not saying that we follow

1672
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,120
that if

1673
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:49,040
i was just thinking from people who

1674
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,040
write the specs you know we don't want

1675
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,080
to confuse them too much

1676
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:54,960
yeah

1677
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,640
it's just when you map it to programming

1678
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,080
languages

1679
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,319
having properties that can be two

1680
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:02,238
different types just

1681
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:07,318
makes devs have to jump through hoops

1682
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:15,399
because not everybody's using javascript

1683
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,080
cool

1684
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:22,960
uh

1685
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,759
if there are no other comments about

1686
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:28,799
deprecation header

1687
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,719
you know where to find the issues

1688
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,920
yes so if anybody has any additional um

1689
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,640
input or comments or whatever please

1690
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,120
of course you're free to raise an issue

1691
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,158
ideally or comment on the existing ones

1692
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:45,839
we still have to go through the ones

1693
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:47,600
that are open i think there's a total of

1694
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,600
six open issues in there right now so

1695
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,439
it's not it's not huge it's also not a

1696
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:52,719
huge spec

1697
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:54,719
but we definitely still have to do some

1698
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:57,880
some work

1699
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,520
excellent

1700
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,760
okay

1701
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,239
i am potency key

1702
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,960
so uh

1703
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,199
i i think mark just went through all of

1704
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:20,880
the drafts and just added an issue he

1705
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,560
restricted fields

1706
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,960
um and i think it's a great suggestion

1707
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,800
and as i mentioned the chat before we

1708
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,080
should just

1709
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,320
that should be the de facto suggestion

1710
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,080
with specs moving forward use

1711
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,679
restrictory keys unless there's a really

1712
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,760
good reason not to structured fields

1713
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,640
structured headers

1714
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:43,360
uh the

1715
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,880
other

1716
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,320
the other uh issue that came up right at

1717
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,920
uh ietf 111 was the fact that there is

1718
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,920
this existing specification for oasis

1719
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,800
called repeatable requests um

1720
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,400
for doing a similar thing

1721
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,480
um

1722
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,000
however

1723
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
uh from my reading of it uh the beatles

1724
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,840
request is is

1725
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,760
somewhat more ambitious and puts

1726
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,960
signific an additional burden on

1727
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,239
the

1728
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:21,679
server side uh so it is an interesting

1729
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:23,040
question as to

1730
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,040
whether or not it makes sense to have

1731
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,120
these two things

1732
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,360
two different specs live side by side

1733
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,320
depending what requirements are

1734
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,000
sanjay you want to speak to that

1735
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,920
curious i am seeing

1736
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,840
first of all i want to apologize there

1737
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,560
are no drops since last

1738
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:45,360
uh

1739
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:49,280
meeting uh bad on us

1740
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:53,600
but we definitely would produce one

1741
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,679
before the next one

1742
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:56,719
um

1743
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:57,760
i

1744
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:58,050
am

1745
01:11:58,050 --> 01:11:59,840
[Music]

1746
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,080
looking at the issues and there was one

1747
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,880
i think eric you you have sent an email

1748
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,440
to order or data comments list did you

1749
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,440
receive anything

1750
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,760
do you have any updates for us

1751
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,800
on that

1752
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,159
uh i wasn't sure that's one issue

1753
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:17,120
that

1754
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,520
just came up right after we

1755
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,840
released the draft and we haven't made

1756
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,280
any progress on that also

1757
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,679
yes if i may jump in here so yeah i did

1758
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:29,920
receive some so the problem or problem

1759
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,640
the issue with the oasis repeal request

1760
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,719
aspect is that it kind of has a bigger

1761
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:36,640
scope but it's not just the item policy

1762
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,320
key they also have these correlation

1763
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,199
keys

1764
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:41,120
so that you can correlate

1765
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,800
requests um

1766
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,760
more easily and some specs do or some of

1767
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,239
the practices out there do both some of

1768
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:50,480
them do only item policy keys so in

1769
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,840
terms of the

1770
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,400
practice i think that's out there the

1771
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,600
oasis repeatable requests

1772
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,000
method has

1773
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,040
more applicability or is something that

1774
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,760
uncover more possible scenarios what

1775
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:06,540
people are doing

1776
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:07,679
[Music]

1777
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,080
but that would also mean that if if we

1778
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,679
did

1779
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,840
wanted to align those

1780
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,920
or say um

1781
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,440
there there is a mechanism for doing

1782
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,320
that

1783
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,600
then that

1784
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,920
would also mean that we need some kind

1785
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,080
of correlation identifier correlation

1786
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,120
key and we we don't have that right now

1787
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,600
so yes i heard back from that

1788
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,600
and basically what we ended up with is

1789
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,600
saying yes there's overlap but there is

1790
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,640
also a difference in scope

1791
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:47,840
so one question i have is

1792
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,640
if the repeatable request does some more

1793
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,199
advanced things what is the better place

1794
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:56,159
in the world to end up with a repeatable

1795
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:58,320
request spec that says

1796
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,600
hey if you want to do something more

1797
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,840
sophisticated go do it that way

1798
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:02,880
or

1799
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,080
do an ietf spec that would like the item

1800
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,000
potency key which

1801
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,480
allows you to do it in a simple way but

1802
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,520
also

1803
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,840
adds in

1804
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,080
additional semantics to allow you to

1805
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,000
also do the things

1806
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,560
that repeatable requests

1807
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,520
effectively keep creating a competing

1808
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,679
spec

1809
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:28,800
for those for the with the repeatable

1810
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,199
requests

1811
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,560
that's a good question and i don't have

1812
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,199
a good answer to that

1813
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:39,280
sanjay

1814
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,440
so

1815
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,960
before writing this up uh

1816
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,040
i

1817
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,280
did a bit of digging and i found so many

1818
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,679
instances where

1819
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,640
uh what we have so the draft comes after

1820
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,199
a lot of implementation it seems right

1821
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:59,679
it's not like uh i think the application

1822
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:01,840
is bit different where

1823
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,159
we don't have as many when we started

1824
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:07,040
writing it we didn't have as many

1825
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,960
implementations out there

1826
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,040
now they have increased a lot

1827
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,960
but in this case

1828
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,400
it was already used by so many uh api

1829
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,600
developers

1830
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,400
so

1831
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,640
uh it was more about

1832
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,360
standardizing and honestly i didn't come

1833
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:27,440
across oasis's draft then or or usage so

1834
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,360
i don't know eric has been looking at a

1835
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:32,000
lot of apis also he might have

1836
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,120
uh

1837
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:36,239
seen it but i had not seen it

1838
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:38,480
so i was just wondering um

1839
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,520
uh we can refer uh this

1840
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,320
but uh

1841
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,800
this deserves its own

1842
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,880
uh place uh since there are lots of

1843
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,880
implementations already using it without

1844
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,840
it being a draft

1845
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:58,640
yeah i suppose there's there's

1846
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,960
no harm whatsoever in

1847
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,199
creating an initial version of the item

1848
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,280
policy key that just serves the basic

1849
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,640
requirements

1850
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,719
and limit the scope

1851
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:11,040
and if there's demand for more value

1852
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,199
more sophisticated scenarios then

1853
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:15,520
address that as a later concern

1854
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,000
i i suspect the reason why

1855
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,520
the oasis repeatable requests it can't

1856
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,640
have more

1857
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,880
independence in implementation

1858
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,360
dependencies is because it's largely

1859
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,080
targeted at people who are building our

1860
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,679
data apis with our data machinery for

1861
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:35,920
implementation hence they can make some

1862
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:39,280
implementation assumptions so

1863
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,600
probably

1864
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,000
a safer bet to keep it

1865
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,960
closely scoped

1866
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:47,760
to

1867
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,000
the current implementation requirements

1868
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,840
of people who are using item policy key

1869
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,920
at least that will get us the finish

1870
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:07,159
line quicker

1871
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,880
uh so the only other item

1872
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,600
that uh was listed in the item policy

1873
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,840
key repo that had uh activity on was um

1874
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,560
a request to add an appendix about how

1875
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,560
this relates to

1876
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,719
conditional requests

1877
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:35,120
um there seemed to be support of that

1878
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,360
and

1879
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,480
i didn't see any objections other than

1880
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:45,839
the fact it will take more time

1881
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,640
awesome

1882
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:57,520
cool

1883
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,760
um

1884
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:04,080
so that brings us to the end of uh

1885
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,280
the notes on

1886
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,400
[Music]

1887
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,320
the documents

1888
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,400
and the only thing

1889
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,640
that i want to just call folks attention

1890
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:13,440
to

1891
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,480
is uh mark created a

1892
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,920
repo to have github discussions

1893
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:23,120
and has filled it with we could do this

1894
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,640
we could do that

1895
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:27,280
his he has no shortage of suggestions

1896
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,960
for work that could be done

1897
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,719
um and one of the the uh

1898
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:35,760
specs that was raised and that might be

1899
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,600
interesting for this working group is

1900
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,390
this health check api um

1901
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:42,000
[Music]

1902
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,520
and so

1903
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:47,679
if you have scenarios in your

1904
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:49,679
working environment where having a

1905
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:52,320
standardized response to health check

1906
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,159
would be useful i encourage you to take

1907
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:55,840
a look at that spec and

1908
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,440
uh

1909
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:01,040
go take a look at the discussions and

1910
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,159
um

1911
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:04,400
i

1912
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,679
with my very newbie chair hat on a

1913
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:11,120
little reluctant to suggest hey let's

1914
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:14,080
just take on another one and i'm very

1915
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,480
happy to see link set go into

1916
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,400
heading to last call so that we can

1917
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,159
shepherd some documents

1918
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:21,280
out

1919
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:24,000
and make room for new ones but i

1920
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,360
would definitely love feedback or

1921
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,679
whether you think that this health check

1922
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,440
api is

1923
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:32,239
worth adoption

1924
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:37,239
mark

1925
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,360
so to be clear i i created that repo so

1926
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,640
hopefully other people will put their

1927
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,719
ideas in there too um but yeah i do have

1928
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:45,679
a few

1929
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:46,880
um

1930
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,800
and from my perspective

1931
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,040
i'm looking you know when if if things

1932
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:53,280
get upvoted a lot or if you know there's

1933
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,560
a lot of discussion about something that

1934
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,320
to me is an indication that i'll put

1935
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,719
more energy into it um you know there

1936
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,840
are a lot of different things i could

1937
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:02,320
write um but if people aren't interested

1938
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,600
i'm not going to put the energy into

1939
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,360
them so if folks want to put what

1940
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:06,480
they're interested in that would be

1941
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,360
really helpful or down vote or or say

1942
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,040
this is a bad idea that's that's helpful

1943
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:11,920
too

1944
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,520
and and of course put their own ideas in

1945
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,920
there yeah

1946
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,159
sanjay

1947
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:29,120
yeah so this one uh i came across this

1948
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,800
while uh

1949
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,560
looking at uh

1950
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,760
spring boots uh inbuilt uh

1951
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,639
implementation on health check and uh i

1952
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:40,400
think i have asked this question to the

1953
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:44,400
author um because he has referred that

1954
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,880
he has looked at different uh i think

1955
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:50,480
assure health and spring boot and all

1956
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,800
and try to accommodate those things but

1957
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,360
what i couldn't find was

1958
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,280
uh spring boot is used a lot in

1959
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:00,480
enterprises right and have they adopted

1960
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,520
it or not and if they have adopted this

1961
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:04,400
then

1962
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,280
it's a very strong case but this is a

1963
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:10,719
very general problem and to have

1964
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:13,040
that defined in a

1965
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,600
standard form would help a lot

1966
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,199
so i think it's very relevant but uh

1967
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:21,840
i had some questions about you know

1968
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,239
where it is adopted because there are

1969
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:27,440
lots of implementations and if this

1970
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:28,719
is

1971
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:31,040
different than those popular

1972
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,480
implementations

1973
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:35,360
then adoption may take uh

1974
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,639
some

1975
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:37,760
uh

1976
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,639
you know it may not be as good so

1977
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:42,960
so i thought that maybe we can ask the

1978
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,040
question invite the author and

1979
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,199
find that out

1980
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:49,120
and yeah i really like that discussion

1981
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,080
group

1982
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:53,400
thanks mark

1983
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:02,638
eric

1984
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,639
yeah and so in terms of

1985
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:09,600
um adoption right i think like with

1986
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,360
some of the things that that we're doing

1987
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,360
in this group it's it's always the same

1988
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,120
we look out there and we see that there

1989
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,480
are

1990
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,960
20 different ways how people do stuff

1991
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,719
and then we come up like the good old

1992
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:23,120
xkcd right we come up with the 21st way

1993
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,120
and we hope that it is more convincing

1994
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,880
than the 20 ways

1995
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,440
but it always is going to be something

1996
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:32,239
where it takes some time until um some

1997
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,639
specific approach of doing that gains

1998
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:35,760
momentum

1999
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,239
but i think for the health check part we

2000
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:40,400
we do see that is a pattern that you see

2001
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,719
in a lot of apis so the pattern is

2002
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:44,719
definitely something that is pretty

2003
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:47,199
popular so i think it definitely is

2004
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:49,360
something that could have quite a bit of

2005
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,440
impact and

2006
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,040
just having one other building block

2007
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,120
that you don't have to come up with um

2008
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,800
by yourself but you can just say okay

2009
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,440
health check apis if we have an and

2010
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,760
health check endpoint in our api this is

2011
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:05,400
how we're gonna do it

2012
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,000
i i think one thing that's appealing to

2013
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,159
me is it's another

2014
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:13,199
um

2015
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:16,400
example of a media type like http

2016
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,520
problem

2017
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:20,480
that addresses a horizontal need

2018
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,239
across

2019
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:27,199
http apis and demonstrates the value of

2020
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:30,159
putting a chunk of semantics to solve a

2021
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:32,719
particular problem in a media type

2022
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:35,600
which is not a concept that

2023
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:39,920
many ap api designers are familiar with

2024
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,320
they largely see

2025
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,880
media types as

2026
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,440
well that's applications like json right

2027
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,960
and we just put all of our semantics

2028
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,120
inside application slash jason

2029
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,520
um so i i

2030
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:54,480
i

2031
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,159
i'm definitely enthusiastic for

2032
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:57,440
supporting

2033
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,920
these kind of semantically rich

2034
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:03,320
media types

2035
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,199
you

2036
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:30,880
do anything other than go to the chat

2037
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,120
tab

2038
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:38,080
say that again braun i didn't catch

2039
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:41,159
the beginning

2040
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:53,718
i'm confused

2041
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,840
okay move on

2042
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:02,800
um

2043
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,920
okay operator perfect uh

2044
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,400
next step on this

2045
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,600
i think we have uh

2046
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,080
do we have to invite the author

2047
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:14,450
to

2048
01:25:14,450 --> 01:25:16,000
[Music]

2049
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,800
some what what i think

2050
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,480
that probably needs to be conveyed on

2051
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:21,520
that

2052
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:24,159
discussion

2053
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:28,559
that's good call uh eric

2054
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,280
yeah so i i've spoken with iraqi and

2055
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,760
he's he's kind of interested but is also

2056
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,600
something that that i think he hasn't

2057
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,440
looked at for a little while

2058
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:41,040
so um if we're interested

2059
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,880
to maybe

2060
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,600
add this to our list i'm sure we can

2061
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,080
um we can get him to

2062
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,080
join as a guest or something like that

2063
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,199
so

2064
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:53,199
yeah he's definitely he's not focusing

2065
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:54,719
on that anymore so it's kind of just

2066
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:56,080
sitting there but i think it is

2067
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,199
something

2068
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:59,440
that is useful and could be a very

2069
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:03,280
useful thing for the group to produce

2070
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,800
and to answer your question sanjay i

2071
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,080
think i need to talk to uh folks because

2072
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,120
i have

2073
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:14,639
i have uh rich nodding when i say

2074
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:16,719
we shouldn't take any more things on and

2075
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:19,280
i have mark in the chat saying oh you

2076
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:22,000
can take on lots of more things

2077
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:22,719
so

2078
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,960
we we will we will

2079
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:28,960
get consensus on our capacity and then

2080
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,679
we'll go chase iraqi

2081
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,920
agreed we need to i mean it's not

2082
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,600
totally our decision you know if the

2083
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,760
working group

2084
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,440
buckles down and finishes off the

2085
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,840
existing drafts quickly and certainly

2086
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,600
eric and other and sanji and others have

2087
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,360
been trying that's great

2088
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,360
but we don't want to overload people and

2089
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,440
have a bunch of things in draft that

2090
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,159
don't progress

2091
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,159
but

2092
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:00,960
it's up to the group

2093
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:02,639
martin

2094
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:04,320
so you can finish something before you

2095
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,800
take more work on and that's

2096
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,600
that will certainly

2097
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,120
and because

2098
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,600
when we charted the group one of our

2099
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,360
statements was

2100
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:19,040
you know let's we didn't quite know

2101
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:22,400
how to run this working group and

2102
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,120
because it had such a broad scope

2103
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,520
and we were like well let's

2104
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,840
try it for six months and see how it

2105
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,880
goes

2106
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,520
and we are somewhat further along than

2107
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:36,000
six months

2108
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,480
and we need to

2109
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,080
as martin says show we can finish

2110
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:43,080
something

2111
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,040
so

2112
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,760
if there is no any other business for

2113
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,120
many folks

2114
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:09,800
uh it looks like we can end early

2115
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,679
go ahead

2116
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:29,199
so i have a question about the query uh

2117
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:30,320
method

2118
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,960
if it would also i can't find the draft

2119
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,560
anywhere

2120
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,440
um

2121
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:38,480
but or maybe i misunderstood but uh i

2122
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,480
wonder if there will also be a

2123
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:43,360
corresponding

2124
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,400
head

2125
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,400
method

2126
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,760
so uh

2127
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,440
where you have a query on the payload

2128
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:52,719
but you get only the headers back

2129
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:56,120
and no payload

2130
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:06,480
did you understand my question

2131
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,080
yeah i'm thinking though it's it's

2132
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,400
probably hard for head

2133
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,080
to do something

2134
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,760
because you didn't send the body but

2135
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:16,800
i'll let mark speak to that

2136
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,600
microphone working yay

2137
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,639
um

2138
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:24,480
yeah it's uh so to be clear this is a

2139
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,159
draft in the http working group and

2140
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:28,400
we've pasted the um

2141
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,360
uh link into the chat a few times now uh

2142
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:34,000
uh it's not called draft

2143
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,239
anything query because we're we're not

2144
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:37,840
we haven't locked down the the method

2145
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,639
name so it's the safe method with body

2146
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:43,600
and it's in the http working group um i

2147
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,520
like daryl i think daryl's on the right

2148
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,880
path there i think

2149
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:47,840
if if

2150
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:48,880
if it

2151
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,719
well you'd send the whole query but you

2152
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:53,600
don't get the response back

2153
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,000
that seems weird and honestly

2154
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
you know i say it's i see it as a dry

2155
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,400
run basically you could have a

2156
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,480
it work as a dryer on them to know if

2157
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,560
your career would get accepted or not

2158
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:06,480
but maybe it's just

2159
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:09,199
yep um

2160
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,639
i see your point um i i do wonder if

2161
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:15,199
maybe that could be triggered with a

2162
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:17,360
header on the request for example

2163
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,840
i just know that you know

2164
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:21,679
head adds a lot of weird corner cases to

2165
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:23,040
http

2166
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,040
and and i'm not

2167
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,120
100 sure that if we were designing http

2168
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,560
from scratch today we would still do

2169
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,520
head

2170
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,080
acknowledging that it's useful but

2171
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:33,920
you know it's it's having two methods

2172
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:34,960
that are supposed to have the same

2173
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,960
semantics and supposed to operate in the

2174
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,320
same way except that one doesn't return

2175
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:39,280
a body

2176
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:42,080
create some weird corner cases so

2177
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:43,440
um

2178
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,960
yeah sure if you have a requirement for

2179
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:47,280
that uh please open an issue on the repo

2180
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,400
it's certainly an interesting discussion

2181
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,600
to have

2182
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:53,520
okay i'll do it thanks thanks

2183
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,199
so

2184
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:01,120
i'll mention

2185
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,960
the charter there's some discussion

2186
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,880
going on in the chat the charter for

2187
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,320
this working group

2188
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,800
is different from how most working

2189
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,239
groups are chartered

2190
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:12,800
they're given specific tasks

2191
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,840
and

2192
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:18,159
uh and you know

2193
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:21,440
uh advisory deadlines milestones as to

2194
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,600
when we would meet them

2195
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,040
uh this group

2196
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:27,360
um thanks to mark

2197
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,040
was deliberately left open and so

2198
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,120
there's very few specifics in it and

2199
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,199
it's like well let's see what the group

2200
01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:34,400
needs to do

2201
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,480
it's supposed to have been revised a

2202
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,199
while ago francesca says yeah that's um

2203
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:40,880
hard to do

2204
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:43,440
but we are unusual from other groups in

2205
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,840
that we don't have specific

2206
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,520
things to do

2207
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:50,159
and mark you can speak next since i

2208
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:53,360
assume you want to talk to that

2209
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,600
kind of put a poison pill in this

2210
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,199
charter because

2211
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:01,600
at least for me personally

2212
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,440
my goal for this was to make sure that

2213
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:06,800
we created a group that was connected to

2214
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,440
the http api community

2215
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,800
and and connected to real world

2216
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,639
implementation and deployment

2217
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:14,639
um and if it was just a bunch of itf

2218
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:16,080
folks sitting around a campfire chatting

2219
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:17,920
about what they thought about http apis

2220
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:19,760
i was not interested in perpetuating any

2221
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,760
such thing um i think we've we've done

2222
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,120
that to some degree we have some

2223
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,920
participation from the hp api community

2224
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:28,880
um and and what i'm going to to you know

2225
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,239
we have taken a little longer than than

2226
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:31,760
we originally thought to get something

2227
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,040
out the door

2228
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,520
um but what i would plead with our

2229
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,080
area director who i see is up next is

2230
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,400
that if i strongly suspect that if we

2231
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,159
get a couple of as they say runs on the

2232
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:43,600
board if we get a couple of specs

2233
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,440
shipped that actually

2234
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,840
add value to the hba api community i

2235
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:50,080
think that will feed more energy into

2236
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,239
the group and get us some some new

2237
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:54,080
people uh who are more connected to the

2238
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:56,480
hp api world involved not that we don't

2239
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:58,400
have people now it's just i i want more

2240
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,440
of them

2241
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:02,400
um and and so i i think it would be

2242
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,560
great to see us ship a few specs and see

2243
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:08,159
what happens next

2244
01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:10,000
but i do feel like we have a

2245
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,040
fairly uh uh successful and and i've

2246
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,080
been happy with the nature of the

2247
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:15,040
meetings

2248
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:16,159
i've been wondering a little bit if

2249
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:17,360
maybe we should hold in from meetings

2250
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:18,960
once in a while it's something maybe the

2251
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,880
chair should discuss or talk to the

2252
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,400
community about

2253
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,159
but yeah i'm pretty happy with where

2254
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:26,638
we're at now

2255
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:32,080
hi

2256
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:32,960
um

2257
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:35,120
yeah i just wanted to

2258
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:36,480
repeat what

2259
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,719
i was saying in the chat which is

2260
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:40,320
there is this requirement in the chat

2261
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,400
which is to assess whether the group is

2262
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,960
functioning well

2263
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,560
and it it

2264
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:49,360
explicitly mentions not only me but the

2265
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,400
asg

2266
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:51,920
so i think that

2267
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:54,320
there is an ip for me to bring this

2268
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,560
in front of the isg and have some sort

2269
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,080
of um

2270
01:33:58,080 --> 01:33:59,440
discussion i don't know if it needs to

2271
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,440
be like a

2272
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:05,040
telechat or an informal telechat

2273
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,360
but i will make sure that this happens

2274
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,440
just so that we are complying with the

2275
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:11,760
charter text i personally think that the

2276
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:13,920
working group is functioning well

2277
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:16,880
even though that's very subjective so

2278
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,400
it's kind of hard to say is it

2279
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,800
functioning well if we don't have a

2280
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,400
um

2281
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,239
like very precise

2282
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:25,920
um

2283
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,080
details of what that means or

2284
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:29,360
yeah

2285
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:29,780
but

2286
01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:31,280
[Music]

2287
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,040
yeah this doesn't mean the working group

2288
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,199
is on probation this is just i i guess

2289
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:36,320
another

2290
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:37,679
um

2291
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:38,800
um

2292
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:41,679
another moment to be able to discuss

2293
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:42,800
how

2294
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,119
to uh

2295
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:47,119
how things are working for everybody i

2296
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:49,520
guess for the community as well

2297
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,760
um

2298
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:53,520
and

2299
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,840
it is working well if we ship good stuff

2300
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:58,159
yes i guess that's the

2301
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:00,080
the main thing but but it also takes a

2302
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:02,320
little bit of time to do that so

2303
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,760
no documents yet doesn't mean

2304
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,560
necessarily that it's not working well

2305
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:07,760
um

2306
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:10,239
and i agree with mark about possibly

2307
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:12,239
possibly having interims that would be

2308
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:13,199
nice

2309
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:16,400
and coordinating with http um

2310
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:19,040
which i know you're already doing but

2311
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,560
yeah they have

2312
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:23,600
interims to replace um

2313
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:28,960
itf meetings like week meetings so

2314
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,239
okay and

2315
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:32,639
um i don't know if we want to like start

2316
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:36,400
a discussion in the main list about

2317
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:38,159
well

2318
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:40,480
so that i can bring that to the asg

2319
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:43,600
if that would be useful at all or

2320
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:44,560
um

2321
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:47,119
or it's just

2322
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:50,000
maybe not that useful

2323
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,480
cheers do you have an opinion and mark

2324
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,040
and everybody else

2325
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,639
sorry i don't know if it was just me but

2326
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:58,239
francesca you cut out there for part of

2327
01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:00,400
that

2328
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:08,560
um okay i i don't know which part

2329
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:09,600
um

2330
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,920
but the last thing i was saying is that

2331
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:13,440
i don't know if it would be interesting

2332
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:16,639
to have uh uh start the mailing

2333
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:18,480
mailing list thread

2334
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:19,440
um

2335
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,360
just to get feedback from the community

2336
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,600
that i can then bring to the isg to have

2337
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,440
that discussion about easy functioning

2338
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:26,719
well

2339
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:29,600
or maybe that's not useful and i just

2340
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,280
have that informal discussion with the

2341
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:34,280
asg

2342
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:41,440
muted rich

2343
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:48,360
you're muted rich

2344
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:55,119
my view is you know if the if the icg in

2345
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:57,840
the discussion has concerns then we can

2346
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,679
probably have some discussion

2347
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:00,960
but

2348
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:02,400
i don't

2349
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,320
know that we need to i think the idea of

2350
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,880
having interims in particular

2351
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,520
co-located

2352
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,280
virtually where

2353
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:14,000
other api working groups are involved

2354
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,280
you know w3c and or you know what

2355
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,679
working group or whoever it is you know

2356
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:20,880
open graph

2357
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,480
that would be a really useful thing

2358
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,800
interesting thing to try doing

2359
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:25,840
um

2360
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:26,639
so

2361
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:28,480
we can talk amongst ourselves or down on

2362
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,320
the list as to where

2363
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,000
you know instead of saying what's a

2364
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,840
venue we should go to what's a place

2365
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:36,000
that we should you know schedule our

2366
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,679
video interim

2367
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:40,080
nearby to help encourage other people so

2368
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:43,199
we can certainly do that

2369
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,679
that sounds good to me

2370
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:52,400
yes since i don't hear anyone

2371
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,320
bringing concerns

2372
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,880
i think i can just have this informal

2373
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,880
chat with the isg and

2374
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:01,679
and then we have done our job from what

2375
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:04,400

2376
