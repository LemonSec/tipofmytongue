1
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,800
hello everyone this is the second pc

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,519
working group session

3
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,039
so

4
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,560
here again

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,359
for

6
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,320
the end of this itf week uh we have a

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,480
tight agenda again

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,079
uh the session is recorded as usual so

9
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,920
you should be used to that

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,000
the typical noteworld

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,640
you should be fully aware of that but

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,360
remember that keep in mind that there

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,239
are iptf rules about ipr on associated

14
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,680
disclosure so make sure you are

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,600
following all the process

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,600
that are pointed out here

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,399
next please

18
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,959
so guidelines

19
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,960
so this is another mythical

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,040
session so

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,720
keep in mind that even if we're on

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,920
face-to-face you should be respectful to

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,880
each other

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,960
we don't need

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,479
we shouldn't need to to have the chair

26
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,439
interrupting a discussion or our

27
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,400
agreement

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
argument between people so make sure

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,720
that you respect all people contributing

30
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,320
to the work we are trying to achieve

31
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,560
here

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,400
next please

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,040
so the agenda if anyone has something to

34
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,759
bash from this second session

35
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,560
now is the time

36
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,479
okay so we'll move on

37
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,520
next please and that's it so keep in

38
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,840
mind that we are record recording a

39
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,159
session state your name when coming to

40
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,920
the queue

41
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,320
turn off your mic when you run talking

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,360
on the

43
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,880
everything will go smooth

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,878
then we have our first presentation

45
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,878
which is related to

46
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,160
the

47
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,319
issue that has been putting out

48
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,239
by drove in the introduction last time

49
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,200
john legitimately refused

50
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,920
an errata that was submitted by oscar on

51
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,760
a pc

52
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,440
rfc

53
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,280
clearly the

54
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,200
problem that is pointed out needs more

55
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,280
than an errata to be fixed

56
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,959
so here a first try to propose a

57
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,040
resolution to the issue that has been

58
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,720
pointed out so drive you're the floor

59
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,920
now

60
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,319
thank you julian so let's start this is

61
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,480
a new draft based on

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,200
uh

63
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,360
the issue that julian was just talking

64
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,720
about

65
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,440
this issue has a bit of history uh the

66
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,319
issue basically comes up uh because of

67
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,040
our rbnf and a statement in our base

68
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,560
5440

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,120
draft which requires strict or object

70
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,800
ordering in psep and that keeps creating

71
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,480
some issues so the two issues which are

72
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,120
highlighted in the erata

73
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,400
are here the recent one was between lsp

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,519
object added for stateful psap and class

75
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,400
type object and what should be the order

76
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,560
of these two objects in the request

77
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,680
message is creating some confusion

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,680
similar confusion happened back in

79
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,120
aspect list

80
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,840
this was errata

81
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,319
3672 where also adrian at that time ad

82
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,840
rejected uh derata correctly based that

83
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
this errata is not the right way to

84
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,280
handle it in fact a working group had

85
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,680
one proposal which was a much bigger

86
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,760
proposal which was requiring that maybe

87
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,920
we should have a consolidated grammar

88
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,879
and in fact fix some of the

89
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:54,400
inconsistencies that have popped up uh

90
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,360
in the various extension uh it was

91
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,760
presented couple of times

92
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,840
but it did not go anywhere

93
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,080
and then based on this errata john

94
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,040
suggested that maybe we could go back to

95
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,920
5440 and try to fix this and which is

96
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,080
this approach that we are discussing

97
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,159
today

98
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,880
so what is the motivation as i said uh

99
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,000
5440 had a statement uh that statement

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,079
required that the object ordering should

101
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,120
be as per uh the one that is defined in

102
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,759
that document now that has caused some

103
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,240
complexity we saw the two erratas and

104
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
every time we see new piece of extension

105
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,199
there is this confusion on should i go

106
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,199
back and list all the objects should i

107
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,320
list objects only listed in 5440 and

108
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,720
then what happens when there is like you

109
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,840
know two documents which require strict

110
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,759
ordering between some objects and then

111
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,600
all three of them are to be used

112
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,000
together and there is some inconsistency

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,080
so basically this requires some kind of

114
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,759
like a bookkeeping between all the

115
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,759
parallel extensions another thing that

116
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,199
happens which is kind of unique with

117
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,000
psep is sometimes uh like you know we

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,080
have various different use cases of psep

119
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,320
there is like the optical side there is

120
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,039
now a multicast side and some of them

121
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,639
like the implementations are sort of

122
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,280
separate and most of the time they don't

123
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,800
interact with each other and things are

124
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,759
fine but

125
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,440
suppose there is a common implementation

126
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,840
that is doing both then only much later

127
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,360
on we uh notice these issues so that is

128
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,280
also a very like you know issue which is

129
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,759
uh based on the reality of p sub where

130
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,280
it has so many different

131
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,039
disjoint use cases and disjoint

132
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,280
implementations as well

133
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,600
so this has kind of become a problem

134
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
that we have ignored for all this file

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,199
let's see if we can try and fix it now

136
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,120
so what is this document saying this

137
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,880
document is saying let's just update the

138
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,240
statement

139
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,320
an implementation must form the piece of

140
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,400
message using the object ordering

141
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,880
specified in this document so change

142
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,880
this must to should

143
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,000
uh talk about not just this document but

144
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,479
subsequent document and say that like

145
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,240
you know an implementation should be

146
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,080
prepared to receive peace and message

147
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,600
when they are uh out of order now this

148
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,440
doesn't mean that ordering is completely

149
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,759
going away we should still do ordering

150
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,360
so while sending

151
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,160
uh psap uh like you know should respect

152
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,000
the ordering that is there in the rbnf

153
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
but when it is receiving it could be a

154
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,280
little bit more

155
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,240
uh flexible and spatially flexible when

156
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,120
there is uh no ambiguity sometimes what

157
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,919
happens is that the object present

158
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,160
in two different places the same object

159
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,600
for instance if you take bandwidth

160
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,680
object that can be carried outside and

161
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,000
also can be carried along with rro and

162
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,919
it has two different meanings so of

163
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,360
course it should be completely

164
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,000
unambiguous when it is passing but when

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,960
when

166
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,400
it doesn't really matter the ordering

167
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,560
doesn't matter the the parsing would

168
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,960
anyway succeed we should not have a very

169
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,280
strict condition that the

170
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,240
must of object ordering should be

171
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,639
uh like you know should be handled so of

172
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,000
course there is some word smithing that

173
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
we may need to do to handle all the

174
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,080
cases that are coming up this is just a

175
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,919
zero zero proposal we want to see

176
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,280
whether this is the right approach and

177
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,960
what does the rest of the working group

178
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,440
thinks about this approach

179
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,960
so what happens there is still a

180
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,919
compatibility issue like if somebody is

181
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,000
an older implementation is

182
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,479
handling a very strict implementation it

183
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,520
can send an error saying that no i i i

184
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,720
follow 5440 and i have a strict handling

185
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,639
and if you send me a different order i

186
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,120
will kind of consider that as an error

187
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,960
one interesting point to notice though

188
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,160
5440 had a must it never defined an

189
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
error condition for this case so there

190
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,000
is no error type and error value being

191
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,120
generated

192
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,160
when this out of order thing happens and

193
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
in fact many implementations kind of

194
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,319
keep this very future proof which is

195
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,960
like the normal way of being liberal

196
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,120
when receiving and being a little bit

197
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,840
strict uh when encoding and sending so

198
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,080
most of the implementation do follow

199
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,639
this and do not send an error even

200
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,840
correct but there could be some

201
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,400
implementation out there which could so

202
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,319
we can never like you know we would have

203
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,199
this compatibility issue with legacy

204
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,280
uh changes

205
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,240
so

206
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
uh what does the working group think is

207
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,400
this the right approach to this problem

208
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,039
uh there were past proposals should we

209
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,360
go back to those past proposal and if

210
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,560
this is the

211
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,199
right approach then maybe a to do for me

212
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,800
and anybody else who wants to join in

213
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,960
this work would be we should do a proper

214
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,279
scan of all piece of extensions and see

215
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,519
that we don't leave any other text which

216
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,919
requires object ordering issues and we

217
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,159
can handle it for once for all via this

218
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,240
update and i'm done thank you

219
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,959
thank you

220
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,519
so the chairs would be happy to hear

221
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,120
some feedback from

222
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,480
people of the working group and

223
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,760
especially implementers

224
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,720
existing implementation

225
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,200
may have concerns about the proposal so

226
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,160
i see

227
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,320
people in the queue andrew we want to go

228
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,760
first

229
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,880
hello this is andrew um yeah so my

230
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,720
natural concern obviously is what you

231
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,920
laid out which is you know past

232
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,160
implementations that follow

233
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,240
essentially the strict writing in 5440

234
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,680
to do ordering

235
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,279
in terms of backwards compatibility the

236
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,040
end result is essentially well tough

237
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,120
luck you guys can't interrupt

238
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,720
so that's

239
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,800
that's that's difficult for me to digest

240
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,040
um but at the same time i also don't

241
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,120
have an alternative wordsmith i mean

242
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,080
it's something that i'm gonna have to

243
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,519
think about just you know how can we

244
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,720
allow the future you know miss ordering

245
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,920
while still allowing those past

246
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
implementations to succeed

247
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,880
um

248
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,279
that i'm not quite sure yet so right now

249
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,959
you know just to voice my opinion on it

250
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,600
i'm concerned with

251
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,360
with the backwards compatibility and the

252
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,640
interop that we've been essentially

253
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,560
hardening over the last couple of years

254
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,120
that this now may lead to you know less

255
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,640
interrupt even though the goal is

256
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,800
obviously more in drop in the long run

257
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,279
so that's basically my concerns thanks

258
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,959
thank you this is exactly the kind of

259
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,519
feedback we are happy to hear because we

260
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,760
aren't supposed to choose in a

261
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,279
very short term at the end of the

262
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,200
session obviously so we want to collect

263
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,880
as much feedback as possible and make

264
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,000
sure that

265
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,519
we will do a clever decision in the end

266
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,880
of the process this is just the first

267
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,560
proposal so

268
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,040
this is exactly the kind of comment that

269
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,000
uh we're happy to hear so next one hey

270
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,440
joe

271
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,360
yeah i want to ask if the receiver can

272
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,000
ignore the ordering of the object what

273
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,480
is the usage for the

274
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,150
sender for

275
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,200
[Music]

276
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,360
for sender to order in the

277
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,279
objective understanding

278
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,399
and i think it is

279
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,079
important

280
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,920
to define the rule for ordering

281
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,000
so many type of objects

282
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,880
even precept for example

283
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,440
uh

284
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,279
if i understand your comment i think

285
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,519
this is the usual philosophy in

286
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,079
standards that we have uh followed that

287
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,360
while sending uh you use must but while

288
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,079
receiving you you should so that we

289
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,160
allow a little bit more liberal

290
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,560
uh process so that like you know

291
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,640
unnecessarily we don't cross

292
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,399
error conditions

293
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,079
so that is the

294
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,440
history for this and this is quite

295
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,279
common for instance if you look at rsvp

296
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,200
which i think even adrian pointed out

297
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,279
they do not have the strict ordering

298
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,519
rule uh and they follow the same rb and

299
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,680
f and similar objects than p sub

300
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,040
and i'm looking at the time so julian

301
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,640
just uh like you know yeah

302
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,720
like the queue on oscar is next

303
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,839
hi so just

304
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,519
in the past few years we have suffered

305
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,000
for several problems in the in the

306
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,760
interrupts so

307
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,079
i think that regardless that you allow

308
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,079
some flexibility

309
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,720
in in some places i think that the

310
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,120
grammar needs to be revisited i mean in

311
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,839
a

312
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,480
in a hole either you choose to be fully

313
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,240
strict and then

314
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,800
you put all the orders or the objects in

315
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,120
a same place like we tried to do several

316
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,959
years ago with the draft that

317
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,399
at that point the working group didn't

318
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,680
decide to go

319
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,600
that direction

320
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,079
or if you want to relax you need to say

321
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,240
where to relax because in general if you

322
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,760
suddenly say that a protocol that is

323
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,200
designed to be

324
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,800
in an order you suddenly say that it is

325
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,360
not an order that does not work so

326
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,320
even as you say in some places might fit

327
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,959
but you would need a careful thinking of

328
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,959
all the grammar

329
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,880
as a whole okay so in any case you need

330
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,200
to revisit all the grammar even if you

331
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
take this direction or follow the

332
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,839
complete strict order thank you

333
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,040
thank you oscar boris

334
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,399
yes hi

335
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,200
druvius i support this approach i think

336
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,279
this is the right way to

337
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,160
to proceed only one command maybe it

338
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,480
would be good to signal this relaxing

339
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,040
capability as additional precept

340
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,800
capability to

341
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,839
uh to align with old implementations and

342
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,399
new implementations tuition cover

343
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,040
this is just a proposal

344
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,200
yeah that's an interesting idea to to

345
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,720
share thank you mike

346
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,959
but uh being liberal you know in what

347
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,839
you accept uh in terms of like uh

348
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,760
ordering or whatever

349
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,519
uh being liberal in what you accept is

350
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,600
always a good thing so it's kind of uh

351
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,880
it's assumed that you know

352
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,120
implementations will follow it

353
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,760
uh so i think uh

354
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,519
you know i think it's a good idea uh we

355
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,360
can maybe specify like

356
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
ordering like a

357
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,440
relative between say two objects that

358
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,279
for example okay like path attribute

359
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,800
object has to go

360
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,360
right before the ero object right

361
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,639
but in terms of like globally um

362
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,480
having to you know have some kind of a

363
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,880
global ordering i don't think

364
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,800
that's necessary uh

365
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,040
at all yeah thanks

366
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,839
thanks thank you mike

367
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,199
so thank you people for this interesting

368
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,720
discussion we'll move to the next

369
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,440
presentation and we'll resume the other

370
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,720
one on the mailing list for sure

371
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,639
so quan

372
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,440
i think you're the presenter

373
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,920
yeah okay thank you i would like to talk

374
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,880
about the psap extensions for topology

375
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,839
filter on behalf of the

376
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,120
co-authors so let's slide please

377
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,160
so let's first do the quick recap

378
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,320
pcet constraint draft has been proposed

379
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,240
and presented during uh last two years

380
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,600
it proves

381
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,760
set of constraints for

382
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,760
the network information such as

383
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,560
multiplication id slice id color and

384
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,839
fvid

385
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,800
and now it has been replaced

386
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,320
into four

387
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,440
drafts first we proposed a little draft

388
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,279
to define the

389
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,920
for passport computation it is the

390
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,800
current presenting draft and the second

391
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,079
we merged the kernel tree to the new

392
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,759
kernel draft

393
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,199
third the fa id merged into the seed

394
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,880
algorithm

395
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,320
and already

396
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,320
drafted to define the slice id construct

397
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,519
so let's slide please

398
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,360
this draft is mainly about the property

399
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,880
filter

400
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,000
first the topology filter is defined in

401
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,600
this young topology filter draft

402
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,079
and it has been it has been discussed in

403
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,600
tuesday

404
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,639
a topology filter is a data construct

405
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,759
construct that can be applied on either

406
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,959
a related topology or a user's specified

407
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,360
topology and

408
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,560
viewed as a set of filtering rules

409
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,639
and each topology filter can be

410
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,519
constructed by tribulative reference and

411
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,639
or a set of include airing include or in

412
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,920
the exclude filtering future

413
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,880
the government proposes a set of

414
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,320
extensions for psf to support the

415
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,720
topology filter as their topology

416
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,959
chemistries during their past

417
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,720
computation

418
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,360
last slide please

419
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,079
so first we uh defined a lieutenant

420
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,040
carrier topology filter and so the

421
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,600
following trv can be carried in

422
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,599
topological object to identify the

423
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,760
topology reference

424
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,240
reference the topology could be a

425
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,160
specific igp domain which

426
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,640
is which are which is identified by

427
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,480
source protocol id and instance id multi

428
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,799
topology id aerial id

429
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,240
seed overreaction and

430
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,559
please

431
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,679
so there uh details the source uh

432
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,360
protocol tres designed for a topology

433
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,640
and identified folder space specific

434
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,520
specific source protocol id

435
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,840
the protocol id is defined in uh

436
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,200
as uh is is uh and ospf and bgp ios

437
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,880
multi-topology trv is worse

438
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,360
for the topology id uh further topology

439
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,120
identified by the multi topology id

440
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,080
and the

441
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,919
aerial tre is also defined for topology

442
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,840
identified by this specific area id

443
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,199
last slide please

444
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,320
we also defined the

445
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,120
topology filter that

446
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,360
also can be uh

447
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,960
specified

448
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,080
by a set of include i alien include war

449
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,799
and

450
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,880
exclude filtering filtering rules and

451
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,919
it can be applied on the relative

452
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,679
topology so this document also proposed

453
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,240
a set of extensions for

454
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,559
iro and xro object

455
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,200
for example link id admin group and

456
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,799
source protocol and so on

457
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,559
some objects to

458
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,160
achieve their

459
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,440
influence include adding include and

460
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,799
extra exclude filtering rules for the

461
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,840
topology field

462
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,760
last slide please

463
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,960
so that's

464
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,799
uh the water extensions for precept

465
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,320
and

466
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,799
any question and comments and

467
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,720
discussions are very

468
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,600
welcome thank you

469
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,960
i see people

470
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,879
yeah to be good

471
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
uh the first question is i see you

472
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
mentioned a new draft uh on an rpid

473
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,760
okay hear me

474
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,480
yes

475
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,880
yeah yes yeah yeah

476
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,960
i just checked this object that

477
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,039
submitted this week

478
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,000
which is related to slicing

479
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,160
um before this meeting we have i

480
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,559
submitted a draft on the psab extension

481
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,600
for witness which will be presented next

482
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,840
uh

483
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,320
perhaps suggestion is you can follow the

484
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,840
discussion in the this working group

485
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,600
about the relationship between this one

486
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,000
words

487
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,679
yeah this is

488
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,520
okay you go first

489
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,200
okay uh the second one is there's a

490
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,360
topology filter your model but i see

491
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,799
there's some

492
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,600
difference between these two drafts in

493
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,760
the content

494
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,240
like the the t topology is not covering

495
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,240
this one a division id is not covered

496
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,919
i'm not sure whether you want to have

497
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:50,880
the

498
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,080
consistent

499
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,000
definition of the topology filter

500
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,600
okay thank you um for the first question

501
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,880
is to your draft and

502
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,080
the snipes id concentrate for uh

503
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,440
extended

504
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,799
further xp spa object

505
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,799
we proposed it two years ago

506
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,559
so

507
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,880
as we all know there

508
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,720
the thieves uh

509
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,919
didn't

510
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,440
reach agreement about their uh

511
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,360
uh the term of their identifier of this

512
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,880
network slice

513
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,840
so

514
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,120
uh

515
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,310
[Music]

516
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,880
you

517
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,760
reached the

518
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,400
final agreement for the identifier the

519
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,200
time of the identifier folder slice so

520
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,360
that works nice

521
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,799
uh for the

522
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,480
second question

523
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:54,720
uh

524
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,000
[Music]

525
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,919
yes you're right the

526
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,280
uh

527
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,360
division id is is not included

528
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,039
for in the current

529
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,159
version

530
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,200
uh

531
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,400
we will consider it last version under

532
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,480
the topology tte topology we uh

533
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,760
we we don't consider it uh

534
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,200
because the

535
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,640
uh

536
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,000
it is

537
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,240
not a

538
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,559
a point a a pro point folder

539
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,919
in my opinion

540
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,240
thanks

541
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,880
maybe one for the comment is uh

542
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,520
uh maybe you need to consider the

543
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,480
relationship under the about the

544
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
topology filter in the young model and

545
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,120
the body filter in this psap

546
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,280
what is the procedure

547
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,559
uh

548
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,600
under the

549
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,280
order of using this

550
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,559
rule this mechanism to

551
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,480
provision this information either from

552
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,679
controller to the device or you want to

553
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,760
send the request from the device to the

554
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,640
controller what is the procedure

555
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,400
in the order of this

556
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,600
this this kind of thing i think this is

557
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,960
not clear

558
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,400
from the current

559
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,880
trials

560
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,840
let's move

561
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,640
on uh uh robin uh quickly very quick

562
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,039
comments

563
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,720
uh my uh my two comments the first one i

564
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,320
i thought about this the first page

565
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,520
i think this is the one drop the way why

566
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,640
is divided into the four drops

567
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,600
maybe more drought will be proposed

568
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,520
the first one the second one i think

569
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,200
that's the constraint

570
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
i think there's can be

571
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,440
different considerate but

572
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,159
i doubt if there's a requirement or not

573
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,000
uh thanks robin

574
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,240
i think let's move on uh just a general

575
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,720
comment this we will follow uh whatever

576
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,880
like the tease suggests we will be

577
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
looking out to from the guidance from

578
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,120
peace chair and peace working group

579
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,760
on how to uh like you know how to

580
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,240
process and anyway we are requesting the

581
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,440
authors to

582
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,080
keep alignment between the t's document

583
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,120
and the

584
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,960
and this document

585
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,760
and

586
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,120
there are some other comments which i

587
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,279
will send it on the list but let's move

588
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,440
on

589
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,840
thank you

590
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,679
can you hear me

591
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,279
yes go ahead

592
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,720
okay okay

593
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,480
um

594
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,880
so i'm um

595
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,200
from china mobile so i'm going to

596
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,640
present this support for btn pcp on

597
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,520
behalf of uh all the authors

598
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,320
um

599
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,840
okay next please

600
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,919
um

601
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,520
so the vtn is a virtual underlay network

602
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,559
consisting of a set of dedicated or

603
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,799
shared network resources

604
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,600
and is associated with customerized

605
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,279
logical topology

606
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,559
so it is introduced in the draft test

607
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,840
enhanced vpn and can be used to enable

608
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,000
enhanced vpns um

609
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,720
for the network slice relay realization

610
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,960
so when computing or establishing a

611
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,919
parts in obedient pc needs to take a

612
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,080
written specific resource

613
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
and topology attributes into

614
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,679
consideration

615
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,400
and this document will describe the pcep

616
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,640
extensions to carry waiting information

617
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
in pcp messages

618
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,120
for peace vtn specific past

619
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,039
computational requests and response

620
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,080
also report an update and pass

621
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,600
initiation

622
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,120
okay uh next please

623
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,080
also uh utility call htmtlv um is

624
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,799
defined to carry the video id and

625
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,440
related information in the lspa object

626
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,279
the vpn id is a global significant

627
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,799
32-bit identifier to

628
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,360
indicate that a vacant

629
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,559
and the flags fields are a result of

630
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,200
future use and some optionals like tlbs

631
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,320
which can carry additional

632
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
constraints

633
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,520
upcp capability completing capability is

634
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,880
introduced

635
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,679
and we define one bit d bit

636
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,840
in the flex field

637
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,559
when it is step by pcc

638
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,760
2 1 and then it indicates that the pcc

639
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,320
supports the encapsulation of the data

640
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,159
plan between id

641
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,679
in data packet

642
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,960
and when it's set by 2 1 by pce it

643
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,600
indicates that pc is supposed write

644
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,159
provide pass communication without

645
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,120
with the data plan within id okay

646
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,918
the next piece

647
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,360
also for the vdm trv it can be used in

648
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,320
the basic pce plus computation

649
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,679
it can be carried in a pc request a

650
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,000
message to indicate that the vdn in

651
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,039
which the price competition is requested

652
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,120
and the pce

653
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,600
or should use a network resource and the

654
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,360
topology attributes

655
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,000
associated with a specific radian

656
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,240
as the parameters of the past

657
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,840
computation

658
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,279
and this trv may be carried in the pc

659
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,559
reply message to indicate the pcc

660
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,460
should use the vtn specific resources

661
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,960
[Music]

662
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,360
to constructing the te pass

663
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,159
in the case of past competition failure

664
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,640
the pc reply message may carry the

665
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,559
beijing tlv

666
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,360
to indicate that the computation

667
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,080
was not successful

668
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,840
okay next

669
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,720
please and

670
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,399
this tlv can be used for pass report and

671
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,440
update of the state for pce

672
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,760
a pcc may include

673
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,760
this medium tlv in pc report message to

674
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,080
indicate that p median

675
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,039
uh

676
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,919
in which the t pass is reported

677
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,720
and the pce may include the median tlv

678
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,760
okay

679
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,679
the

680
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,279
trv can be used in pce initiated the lsp

681
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,039
setup

682
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,360
the pce may include the built-in tlv in

683
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,080
the pce initial message

684
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,600
and it will

685
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,240
pcc will use of specific resource and

686
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,360
data plan

687
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,200
waiting id to construct the t pass

688
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
and the mechanism

689
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,279
is

690
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:09,360
applicable to the initial of

691
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,679
ampere's lsps and the isr policies

692
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,520
candidate passes

693
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,960
okay next

694
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,919
so

695
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,320
next we will welcome the comments and

696
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,600
feedbacks

697
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,039
uh we will polish this draft based on

698
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,440
the feedbacks okay

699
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,799
thank you

700
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,039
thank you uh we already have eric in the

701
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,200
queue

702
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,640
thank you for the presentation as you

703
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,679
know uh t's working group agreed on

704
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,880
network resources to call the underlay

705
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,679
resources associated with uh

706
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:44,720
with a

707
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,320
slice

708
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
network resource partition

709
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,600
and

710
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,200
we can pass a nrp id

711
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,210
in the psap message

712
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,000
[Music]

713
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,760
i'm not sure if you want to standardize

714
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,919
to passing two ids a vtn id and an rpid

715
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,279
maybe

716
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,440
authors of this draft should collaborate

717
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,880
with uh

718
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,600
with authors of the draft that quan had

719
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,279
mentioned earlier

720
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,880
i would like to hear the working group

721
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,600
chair's opinion on that as well

722
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,480
uh tariq are we sure that we have this

723
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,960
resolved in teas already at least that's

724
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,279
not my reading and i would welcome like

725
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,440
these chairs to correct me if i'm saying

726
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,559
that wrong

727
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,600
otherwise we have jimmy jimmy good

728
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,559
um

729
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,279
just to answer your question um i did

730
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,200
see then the term network resource

731
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,919
partition in the slice definitions draft

732
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:40,799
that

733
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,520
adrian and editors are driving so um

734
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,000
maybe we can but this is

735
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,840
but this is coming from enhanced vpn

736
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,440
right so and we thought that enhanced

737
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,799
vpn has applicability outside of network

738
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,279
slicing as well so my understanding was

739
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,279
that these two like you know we cannot

740
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,440
say that vtn id can disappear at least

741
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,279
that's what i was reading so

742
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,000
uh please correct me if i'm wrong yeah

743
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,480
exactly that's the point is any protocol

744
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,279
genetic protocol extensions uh

745
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,279
has to reference the genetic term which

746
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,000
is

747
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,760
network resource partition otherwise we

748
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,440
will end up

749
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,760
duplicating protocol extensions and that

750
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,440
was the whole point of

751
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,600
coming up with a genetic term

752
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,440
so indeed

753
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,480
yeah so we're looking for teas uh like

754
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,080
you know guidance on this

755
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,360
uh

756
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,200
jimmy you already said oh you are in the

757
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,840
queue jimmy go ahead

758
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,240
i just want to say that

759
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,519
like we just ever have sent a mail to

760
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,880
have some discussion about the

761
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,360
relationship between the hsb and the

762
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,080
network slides in this mini list i

763
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,399
suggest people to provide their

764
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,799
feedbacks and opinions to that based on

765
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,279
that we can see whether they have the

766
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,279
different scope or not uh canva can use

767
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,000
converge to a like a generic term for

768
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,159
the like protocols and the models like

769
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,919
et cetera

770
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,360
thank you thanks for collecting there

771
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,840
bubban good

772
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,919
yeah you had a question for the teachers

773
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:16,640
so

774
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,080
there was uh an open item after the last

775
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,679
interim on uh or maybe even before that

776
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,840
uh that there was a thread that adrian

777
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,240
started i see him in the queue uh on

778
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,399
what that

779
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,360
what we need to call it uh underlay

780
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,720
uh

781
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,360
construct um and i think there are a few

782
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,159
names that are floating around uh we let

783
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,960
uh from the chest pointer we let the

784
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,640
authors of the framework document pick

785
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,200
what they thought was appropriate uh i

786
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,919
see uh i mean

787
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,000
the term that has been picked in the

788
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,880
draft is a network resource partition as

789
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,480
to whether uh there was a formal uh

790
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,880
uh declaration of with that of that

791
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,399
being the term i mean

792
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,320
there is there hasn't been any

793
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,840
declaration of that we will let the

794
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,519
editor uh

795
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,360
pick what he's deemed appropriate and

796
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,320
i'll let the editor talk

797
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,760
adrian

798
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,559
yeah thanks so i'm editor for the tease

799
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,679
framework

800
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,720
uh

801
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,960
pavan is right there there's no

802
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,320
consensus being called on what the text

803
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,000
in the framework says

804
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,320
i believe that the intention

805
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,080
is to provide a common base reference

806
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,840
and definitions

807
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,600
and allow

808
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,559
other documents to either use that

809
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,440
terminology or to say

810
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,840
what we're doing in this document maps

811
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,519
to the base terminology as follows

812
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,080
i don't think we we are

813
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,039
attempting to force people

814
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,640
to rewrite their documents or

815
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,279
or change their solutions merely to

816
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,840
explain how their solutions map to the

817
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,840
framework

818
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,320
thanks adrian uh i think let's continue

819
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,800
this discussion uh on the mailing list

820
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,040
we will be looking for these feedback

821
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,760
whether an rpid and vtn id are two

822
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,839
different ids they are the same id they

823
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:20,960
belong

824
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,199
so that will like you know have impact

825
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,280
on progressing these documents so thank

826
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,440
you

827
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,800
so kian you're next

828
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,040
all right uh hi my name is dionne mishra

829
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,879
i'm with verizon and i will be

830
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:43,679
presenting an update on the psep ls rack

831
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,000
next slide

832
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,280
so

833
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,760
over the last uh few months i believe

834
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,639
since i ietf 110 we have gotten some

835
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,040
feedback we presented at

836
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,640
itf 110 so just some highlights um as

837
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,079
far as feedback

838
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,359
so some key scenarios um

839
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,440
where where the piece of ls comes into

840
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,200
play is pcc and hpc and we'll we'll go

841
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,960
through that just to recap some in

842
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,160
further slides

843
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,720
so this is an experimental id with an

844
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,520
aim to progress rnd efforts and it's not

845
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,400
and so just to be clear for everyone in

846
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,240
the working group that this is not a

847
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,280
replacement for any existing mechanisms

848
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,359
um there are specific stereo scenarios

849
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,960
highlighted with

850
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,520
with the reuse of the p-sub-session for

851
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,359
where this information is deemed useful

852
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,680
and and that particularly uh indicate in

853
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,280
the use cases of pcecc

854
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,119
what would be useful is to progress this

855
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,040
draft is to find if there's interest in

856
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,119
the experimental work and then pull the

857
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,040
workload for adoption

858
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,520
next slide

859
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,480
so there's some feedback so we had some

860
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,960
positive feedback on lists a few months

861
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,880
ago uh so

862
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,800
agent wang

863
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,880
with china telecom showed some key

864
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,720
interest um he highlighted use a piece

865
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,520
of ls and pcecc scenarios

866
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,560
peter park with telco kt had also

867
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,320
expressed interest

868
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,680
as well as being young with your etri

869
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,119
um

870
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,760
so we would like to uh ask the worker

871
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,160
for adoption on it as an experimental

872
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,000
track and that that's really the goal of

873
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,160
this draft um

874
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,000
the scope and goal of the experiment

875
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,839
would include testing the solution

876
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,079
viability and to help eliminate any

877
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,760
concerns

878
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,920
and then post adoption what we would

879
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,839
like to do is refine the scope of the

880
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,000
experiments an expected outcome

881
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,760
especially targeting scalability

882
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,320
concerns and impacts and other protocols

883
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,960
in the network um so with the post

884
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,880
adoption as we go through that we just

885
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,839
want to

886
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,440
and and it's really in building the

887
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,160
scope we want to actually have folks in

888
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,079
the work group to you know have a

889
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,000
comfort level with with this so we're

890
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,839
not overloading the protocol we're not

891
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,880
overloading with psap using pc

892
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,000
uh

893
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,920
for the uh piece for uh psf ls and

894
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,240
leveraging the southbound interface so

895
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,480
we and with that and that that really

896
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,800
would be part of the development and the

897
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,280
r d effort the overall effort um that

898
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,000
we'd like to uh move forward with you

899
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,320
know once we once a draft is adopted

900
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,560
next slide

901
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,680
sorry next next slide thanks

902
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,640
i think the slides went away

903
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,520
are you not lying

904
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,440
it looks like

905
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,200
trough was dropped

906
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,960
can you hear us

907
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,920
jeff

908
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,800
no offline

909
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,640
i can try to share myself if he if he's

910
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,400
not let me see i haven't done it before

911
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,480
i can try and give it a shot

912
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,920
you want me to try and go ahead and

913
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,960
share or um

914
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,960
try

915
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,359
or julian if you have the slides i guess

916
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,280
if you could share it i guess they're

917
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,320
already uploaded

918
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,440
so

919
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,800
how can i sure share them

920
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,599
oh just back

921
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,480
oh

922
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,240
yeah

923
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,920
can you hear us

924
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,119
rev

925
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,760
oh i got disconnected so let me quickly

926
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,160
come back

927
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,040
am i on the right side uh one yes we're

928
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,440
just one more down after that let's see

929
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,119
yes right here

930
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,359
okay thanks

931
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,320
all right so a quick overall recap

932
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,040
so

933
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,720
update on the latest feedback with the

934
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,640
pc working group um and work group

935
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,280
production adoption call i've used so

936
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,599
use of pset to learn network state and

937
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,920
topology applicable to device to

938
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,440
controller as well as controller

939
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,280
controller hpc

940
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,839
uh complementary extensions

941
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,280
and this is really another tool in the

942
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,920
operator's toolbox so we have existing

943
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,520
mechanisms and this would just would

944
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,359
this would be another mechanism so we're

945
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,280
not replacing anything or changing we're

946
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,320
just adding another another option

947
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,640
uh for operators and and for particular

948
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,119
use cases and the one

949
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,280
main one in particular is uh operators

950
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,839
that are already using pcecc

951
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,079
and in those scenarios where they have

952
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,960
the centralized controller um they could

953
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,839
easily leverage uh pcf ls

954
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,880
a new pcf object a message an object and

955
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,000
resu reuse of the tlb is already defined

956
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,480
uh default is local only

957
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,359
and then

958
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,760
which which which is the uh

959
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,359
r equals r equals zero uh which is which

960
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,359
is the goal that we would like to have

961
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,000
the centralized to use psf ls

962
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,720
for for for the uh

963
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,960
building the topology graph but we have

964
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,160
the flexibility to use uh r equals one

965
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,040
uh defining the draft that you can um

966
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,359
have a hybrid setup and use other

967
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,680
mechanisms as well as piece of ls so

968
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,680
we'd like to make it you know

969
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,319
homogeneous to other other

970
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,079
mechanisms that exist and we're not

971
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,599
forcing anything to go one way or the

972
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,079
other we just kind of kind of want to we

973
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,800
want to keep an open mind and and that

974
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,800
is also the further work as we you know

975
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,359
reach work of adoption consensus we can

976
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,440
dig into that more in more detail next

977
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,440
slide

978
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,440
so uh some use cases and scenarios to

979
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,520
recap so pccc uh some use cases require

980
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,760
direct piece of session to all nodes

981
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,400
reusing that same session to allow to

982
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,599
learn network state is attractive so not

983
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,800
using not having a second protocol such

984
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,880
as a vgpls

985
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,599
enabling the possibility of a single sbi

986
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,839
for some for some use cases

987
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,280
and then hpc

988
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,800
an actn for for enter as um scenarios

989
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
between controllers for boundary nodes

990
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,040
and links as part of the abstraction

991
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,880
domain topology

992
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,880
and then partial so some information

993
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,880
such as optical extensions learn to be a

994
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,680
piece of ls for faster learning uh reuse

995
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,680
of psep synchronization optimization

996
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,760
techniques and incremental updates

997
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,640
as well as other mechanisms can coexist

998
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,200
next slide

999
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,040
so

1000
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,960
um on the left here uh we've gone

1001
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,319
through this slide before you've been

1002
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,079
showing the basic mechanism so we're

1003
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,839
using the existing uh pce cc

1004
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,280
uh

1005
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,960
centralized control architecture so you

1006
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,680
have the pcc instructions um are sent

1007
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,480
down

1008
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,119
on the left to the to each node i'll you

1009
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,640
know for each uh reaching edge pc's pce

1010
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,119
session and then and then the uh the

1011
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,359
topology graph lincoln node information

1012
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,839
sent back up to the controller on the

1013
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,760
left piece of ls

1014
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,440
and node information

1015
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,599
on the right on the right slide showing

1016
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,560
the uh hpc so everything so everything

1017
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,880
is supported as as exists with the hpce

1018
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,599
using psfls and in this case

1019
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,680
in in that scenario the child pce the uh

1020
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,240
pcf ls information noted for lincoln

1021
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,280
node information sent from the child pc

1022
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,240
node back up to the parent node next

1023
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,479
slide

1024
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,480
so uh ready for adoption so i we believe

1025
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,200
over the last several months since ietf

1026
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,240
110 when we presented uh

1027
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,240
we feel that we have get you know

1028
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,839
garnish some interest in the working

1029
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,440
group um so so the answer that is yes we

1030
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,640
have and

1031
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,280
um are there target experiments demos

1032
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,720
implementations

1033
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,640
and the answer to that is yes as well so

1034
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,800
some were showcased in the past that had

1035
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,400
a hackathon in bits and bytes some open

1036
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,160
source implementations exist and

1037
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,319
documented some research has showed

1038
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,560
interest and experimented and some

1039
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,640
operators have shown inserts as we as we

1040
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,720
described in the earlier slides

1041
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,480
so so now the question is there a

1042
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,000
possibility of someone getting rough

1043
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,319
consensus to support and support for

1044
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,720
this as an experimental id

1045
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,839
uh so i believe at this point i think

1046
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:27,040
it's the answer is yes and we would like

1047
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,880
to i after you know after

1048
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,599
this it completes uh we would like to

1049
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,000
you know maybe pull the work group or in

1050
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,400
the chairs for um start a work group

1051
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,640
adoption

1052
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,079
thank you thanks john

1053
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,119
any questions again

1054
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,839
go ahead chiang

1055
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,599
i just want to say that i i really want

1056
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,400
uh i want to work on this work it's it's

1057
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,480
already a good work and we do really

1058
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,359
need it because we have bgprs already

1059
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,920
and if you want to make the psap uh

1060
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,000
protocol or like perfect then we need to

1061
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,200
finish this work so that's it thanks

1062
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,160
thank you robin

1063
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,359
right there that's that's their scenario

1064
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,160
so there's another bdp linkage data

1065
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,400
so i think that the pc links they

1066
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,480
definitely have this the application

1067
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,119
scenario

1068
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,839
thank you robin thank you

1069
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,760
yeah

1070
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,079
we prefer the usage of the pc pc ls and

1071
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,280
the pdp

1072
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,119
so let me do that

1073
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,520
there is only one router can report the

1074
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,680
upload information to the pce i think

1075
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,319
this can certainly simplify the

1076
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,160
implementation of the controller under

1077
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,839
the router okay

1078
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,640
can you hear me yeah go ahead

1079
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,319
hello i am

1080
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,720
ali from china telecom we specify pc

1081
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,160
pcp extensions to optimize the

1082
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,280
employment

1083
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,520
implementation of multicast source

1084
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,960
registration or revocation receiver auto

1085
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,280
authentic discovery and forwarding

1086
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,800
control of multicast data by using pcp

1087
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,160
methods

1088
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,280
to trans transmits multicast management

1089
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,880
signaling in sdn scenario combining with

1090
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,440
the forwarding characteristic

1091
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,319
of

1092
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,960
of fear by using this

1093
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,480
mechanism the unified management of vr

1094
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,200
multicast can be implemented and the

1095
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,839
impact of bgp updates

1096
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,280
on controller can be reduced

1097
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,520
next week thank you

1098
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,480
the pro

1099
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,599
the process consists of

1100
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,240
four main steps the first ingress and

1101
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:18,880
the

1102
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,280
pcp message with multicast source

1103
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,200
information to the controller for

1104
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,319
multicast source registration the second

1105
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:32,240
egress convert idmp or mld message

1106
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,839
receiving from receivers into pcp

1107
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:39,119
message to send on to the controller as

1108
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,839
pce for receivers

1109
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,920
running or leaving the third the

1110
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,560
controller send this screen that is

1111
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,799
stitched based on the source and

1112
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,359
and the receiver information informing

1113
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,839
the ingress how to forward or stop

1114
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:56,960
forwarding

1115
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,319
the force

1116
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,839
and the receiver

1117
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,599
statistics

1118
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,079
is regularly

1119
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,760
synchronized between egress and pce or

1120
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,000
between pce and ingress

1121
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,119
some comments were made as a pre

1122
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,680
previous meeting including the objects

1123
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,720
format

1124
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,559
here does it is tested to break these

1125
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,040
objects down more the objects are

1126
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,440
tightly coupled with sphere multicast

1127
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,800
information in pc message should be able

1128
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,319
to use the in number multicast scenario

1129
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:37,760
in this update

1130
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,599
the overall process

1131
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,960
process has not changed our main change

1132
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,480
from the previous version is to put some

1133
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,200
duplicates fills into

1134
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,400
t always increasing the instance

1135
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,160
instanceability of messages in addition

1136
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,400
the judgement flag for

1137
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,480
multicast is added

1138
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,280
carrying different tlvs

1139
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,200
multicast information

1140
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,680
in piece of method

1141
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,559
message can also be used to number

1142
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,280
multicast scenario

1143
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,839
we defined for new tier with namely

1144
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,880
multicast source address address tlv

1145
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,200
multicast group address tlv next vpn

1146
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,640

1147
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,040
wait vpn information here we can

1148
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,960
contains rd

1149
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,040
and the forwarding tag the label lens

1150
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,040
can be set to thereof your information

1151
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,160
until we continue to identify

1152
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,040
identification information in

1153
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,200

1161
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:04,800
the peer flag indicating whether the

1162
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,760
message is here multicast these two

1163
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,240
objects can be used in both sphere and

1164
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,359
number scenario

1165
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,359
with any information

1166
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,240
tlv and the vrtov can be selected

1167
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,720
carried in this two method next page

1168
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,119
thank you

1169
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:24,720
next page

1170
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,480
thank you

1171
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,520
for watching object content sphere

1172
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,920
forwarding information specifically

1173
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,079
something id as i bsl and

1174
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,960
this screen file object that does not

1175
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,160
need to carry beer information tlv and

1176
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,119
can only be used in beer scenario

1177
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,599
next page thank you

1178
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,720
multicast receiver

1179
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,240
status object should

1180
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,839
should include only cancer source

1181
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:01,359
here we and multicast group address tlv

1182
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,400
the use the usage is constant

1183
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,839
consistent in beer scenario and non-fear

1184
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,040
scenario

1185
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,520
that's the main content of this draft

1186
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,079
any comments on our work are welcome

1187
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,480
thank you

1188
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,520
uh thank you ronan any questions while

1189
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,280
we are waiting for questions

1190
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,040
this was presented in beer's working

1191
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,599
group as well and we had a discussion

1192
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,920
following that that how do we coordinate

1193
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,800
the work between pce and beer and one of

1194
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,640
the suggestion was that we need to get a

1195
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,920
very clear set of like requirements from

1196
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,760
the beer working group and overall

1197
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,760
architecture that we can

1198
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,720
check against right now in pce there are

1199
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,520
couple of documents related to beer and

1200
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,119
the overall

1201
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,720
requirements and architecture is not

1202
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,200
very clear even if we take this document

1203
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,520
for instance there is lot of beer and

1204
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,319
non-beer things inside the same document

1205
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,480
and which is kind of very confusing when

1206
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,880
we read so we need to look at this whole

1207
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,760
work holistically uh any other that's

1208
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,079
just my thoughts uh any other

1209
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,200
comments from the working group

1210
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,680
uh tony go ahead

1211
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,400
yeah so i think um as we talk in the

1212
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,800
beer working group drove um i think the

1213
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,079
best is to pull uh interim with the

1214
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,800
charcoal being pretty much uh

1215
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,760
a requirements document um

1216
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,920
from your site uh and from our site is

1217
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,760
beer

1218
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,280
and let's see what comes out of that so

1219
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,880
people are on the same page and we get

1220
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,480
all these documents on the same umbrella

1221
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,880
and we you know in sync architecturally

1222
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,000
speaking

1223
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,119
uh so i suggest to

1224
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,240
get together with greg and um you know

1225
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,640
set up something and start

1226
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:52,000
rolling you know an interim uh and work

1227
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,960
on kind of the charter of the interim or

1228
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,839
rather you know of working a work work

1229
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,800
items during the interim if you are okay

1230
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,119
with that

1231
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,280
thanks tony let's continue discussing uh

1232
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,079
igen go ahead

1233
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:11,280
i think the people in the pure working

1234
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,480
group

1235
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,040
has signed some interested

1236
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,520
for the pc-based solution for the

1237
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,720
multicast

1238
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,880
single signalling so

1239
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,440
here the update for this job just want

1240
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,520
to make the

1241
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,720
make the object a general and possible

1242
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,558
and comment from last

1243
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,160
so i think we can discuss this later

1244
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,640
during the intermediate during the year

1245
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,839
and

1246
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:40,800
okay

1247
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,520
yeah uh arjun i agree the only comment

1248
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,200
mine was that the document is called

1249
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,760
pc-based beer then it should not have

1250
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,000
non-beer parts in it we need to have a

1251
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,839
clarity of what is uh applicable for any

1252
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:57,200
multicast overlay and we had rsvp we

1253
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,920
have sr p2mp policy as well so we don't

1254
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,599
want things which are generic to be a

1255
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,960
part of a beer extension to pc that was

1256
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,000
what i was trying to say okay

1257
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,800
again go ahead

1258
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,280
yeah george i was just gonna chime in on

1259
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,839
the same that i think this uh documented

1260
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:20,000
should probably should really focus on

1261
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,520
beer and not and not non-beer related as

1262
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,079
it does confuse the uh the goal of the

1263
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:28,960
uh since there's already i believe rc

1264
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,359
6006 which talks about

1265
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:35,040
point-to-multi-point uh pce extension so

1266
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,520
there's already existing work that that

1267
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,079
deals with non non-viewer specific

1268
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:41,280
multicast

1269
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,359
so i agree this should be really just

1270
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:45,839
beer related

1271
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,319
uh thanks jan let's move ahead we have

1272
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,640
still have two presentations to go

1273
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,880
uh

1274
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,000
balaji

1275
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,280
are you here

1276
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,079
yes go ahead

1277
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,319
uh biology the slides are already in

1278
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:07,680
front

1279
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,200
do you mind if we continue we don't we

1280
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,960
are running out of time so please go

1281
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,839
ahead and start speaking

1282
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,599
biology you need to click on the my my

1283
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,000
button to start speaking

1284
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,720
yeah go ahead now

1285
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,800
uh we lost biology

1286
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,839
yeah apology go ahead

1287
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,960
okay it seems like we're having audio

1288
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,520
issues so let's move on to the next one

1289
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,040
and we'll come back to biology once we

1290
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,920
have time so let's we have five minutes

1291
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,920
and two presentation thank you would you

1292
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,760
like to start and try to do it at two

1293
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,839
minutes so that we can give balaji time

1294
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:50,920
as well

1295
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,000
okay it's my turn

1296
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,760
yeah go ahead quickly

1297
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,960
okay thank you oh hi experts i'm you i'm

1298
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,440
from trinity telecom i'll introduce our

1299
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,799
draft and

1300
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,799
some essential updates

1301
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:07,200
uh considering the last gear development

1302
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,680
of ethernet interface it is possible to

1303
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,760
use the info container in the layer 2

1304
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,640
frame to simplify the end-to-end packet

1305
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,319
forwarding procedure

1306
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:20,000
based on rfc 9050 which specifies the

1307
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,960
precept extensions for pcc to derive

1308
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,359
npr's label switch paths

1309
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,079
this document defines psup extension for

1310
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,400
vlan based traffic forwarding in native

1311
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,920
ip network

1312
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,359
compared with our rfc 8821 which

1313
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:38,640
describes an architecture for pc-based

1314
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,200
traffic for engineering in native app

1315
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,319
networks

1316
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:45,280
this draft describes the processes of

1317
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,280
data packet forwarding system based on

1318
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,200
vlan info

1319
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,480
okay next up is

1320
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,440
well as shown in this figure the

1321
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,119
procedures of

1322
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,119
for event based traffic forwarding are

1323
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:00,799
the follows

1324
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,680
the first step the pc calculates the

1325
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,119
expedited seat

1326
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,440
wrote and sends the route information to

1327
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,799
the pcc's

1328
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:12,720
through pc initiate messages step two

1329
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,680
the ingress pcc like r3 forms of the

1330
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,680
land forwarding routing table the

1331
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:21,440
transit pcc like r1 r2 and r4

1332
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,640
and the egress pcc like r5 forms a vlan

1333
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,960
crossing routing table

1334
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,680
step 3 the packet to be guaranteed

1335
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,599
matches the table and then be labeled

1336
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:33,680
with corresponding valentine as marked

1337
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,599
in the red line

1338
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,040
step 4

1339
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,280
the label packet will be further sent to

1340
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,680
the pcc specific sub-interface

1341
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,400
identified by the tag and then be

1342
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,680
forwarded

1343
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,399
next time please

1344
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,240
well the data packet accomplish the

1345
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,040
calculation processes is shown in this

1346
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,480
figure

1347
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,799
when the original data pack was sent to

1348
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:01,680
the egress node it will look up the vfr

1349
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,720
table of r1 if matched the packet will

1350
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,280
be labeled with the corresponding vlan

1351
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,079
tab

1352
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,640
the labeled packet then will be sent to

1353
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,799
the transit node

1354
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:16,000
similarly it will look up the vcr table

1355
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,040
which

1356
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,440
only contains the in and out vlan and

1357
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,119
then be forwarded

1358
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,480
to the egress node the output the output

1359
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,240
end of vcr

1360
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,359
of vcr table is zero zero

1361
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,359
so the vlan will be unlabeled and

1362
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:34,559
returns to the normal forwarding

1363
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,880
the advantage of this mechanism contains

1364
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,920
three points the first one is it uses a

1365
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,240
completely new address space

1366
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,359
the second one it is suitable for ipv4

1367
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,359
and fb6 networks

1368
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:49,680
and the last one is it can leverage the

1369
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,480
existing pc technologies as much as

1370
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,760
possible

1371
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,400
next episode

1372
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,599
uh based on the last version we made

1373
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:01,839
some updates on the cc object to

1374
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:04,000
indicate the specific

1375
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,920
interface of each node

1376
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,799
and the new bit o to differentiate the

1377
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:13,119
in and out land next time please

1378
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,559
uh and these are the updates of the

1379
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,599
corresponding message content content

1380
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,880
okay next please

1381
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,480
okay that's the main content of our

1382
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,040
draft any other any comments are welcome

1383
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,440
thank you

1384
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:36,520
uh itunes go ahead quick comment please

1385
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,320
existing

1386
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,480
[Music]

1387
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,880
mirror field they will

1388
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,319
meet the ipv4 and the ipv6

1389
00:58:58,319 --> 00:58:59,839
environment

1390
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:00,960
and they

1391
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,240
are trying to align in the cpc solution

1392
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,119
for the llp password

1393
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:09,119
okay

1394
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,960
thanks agent uh

1395
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,200
balaji go ahead let's give it a

1396
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:19,599
shot we lost biology so maybe pawan can

1397
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:22,079
you uh present instead

1398
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,520
go right now yeah

1399
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,960
yeah uh can you go to the next slide

1400
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,000
yeah we did present um uh

1401
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,960
the psup rsvp color draft last time um

1402
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,359
the last ietf there were some comments

1403
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:37,599
uh primarily to make it a bit more

1404
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,839
generic so that's what we ended up doing

1405
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:42,799
can you go to the next slide

1406
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,799
um so yeah

1407
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:46,880
it's it's a single tlv uh it's

1408
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,440
generalized it's used for the use case

1409
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,359
that was uh described last time it

1410
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:55,040
continues to exist uh it just allows

1411
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,040
for it to be used for other use cases as

1412
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,559
well the couple of them that are listed

1413
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,280
here the pc multipath already references

1414
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,160
it

1415
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,839
there was also this notion of

1416
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,119
using it the same way as

1417
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,319
the policy

1418
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:11,359
the

1419
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,599
the policy association

1420
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:15,119
it's a debatable use case but yeah i

1421
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:16,880
mean there was a proposal to do that we

1422
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,839
just left room in case somebody wants to

1423
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,319
use it for that purpose and uh yeah

1424
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,079
there are a few more authors added to

1425
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,520
the list

1426
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,119
um next slide

1427
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:29,040
yeah i think it's yeah it's a

1428
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,400
it's something that's missing in the

1429
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,559
toolkit um yeah we believe it's

1430
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:34,799
sufficiently big to progress to the next

1431
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:37,520
stage request working on production and

1432
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,520
uh further review from the working group

1433
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,119
thanks

1434
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,280
i could not find where this tlv is going

1435
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,079
to be carried which piece of object

1436
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:46,880
uh

1437
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,240
it's it's in the

1438
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,520
uh

1439
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,359
lsp a

1440
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,680
uh it depends it kind of depends on the

1441
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,720
use case so the in the case of mic strap

1442
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,200
the multipath draft it would sit under

1443
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,880
the path attribute

1444
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,760
so yeah i mean we define the tlv here

1445
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,000
yeah we'll let the use case describe

1446
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,599
where it actually sits

1447
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,920
but you do have that rsvp use case as

1448
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,839
well right so at least for rsvp use case

1449
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:13,359
you need to specify

1450
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:15,599
where is this tlp we do

1451
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,960
we do if you in the section that

1452
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,799
in the section that talks about rsvp use

1453
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:22,240
case i think it there should be a

1454
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,599
statement in there saying where it

1455
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,680
should where it says

1456
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,720
it doesn't

1457
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,559
it's in front of me i take your word so

1458
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,040
just take your word

1459
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,119
any other last comments

1460
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:34,319
from the working group otherwise we are

1461
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:37,200
one minute over

1462
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,680
uh i don't see anything so julian last

1463
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,558
words to you

1464
