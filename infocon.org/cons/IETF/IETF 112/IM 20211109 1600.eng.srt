1
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,400
we don't have brian haberman but

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,839
i think he had a conflict anyway and

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,920
he's at the end of this agenda i think

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,520
actually right he's at the of the agenda

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,800
because he does have a conflict

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,960
um

7
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,519
there we go

8
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,000
should we get go onstage

9
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,479
yeah let's do that

10
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,200
okay so yeah here we go um

11
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,280
welcome everyone

12
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,240
itf112

13
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,320
um

14
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,079
here is the note well

15
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,960
you've seen this many times i'm sure um

16
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,119
it's easy to just gloss over this but

17
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,520
it's it's lots of good information here

18
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,399
that i hope people have read

19
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,640
especially the code of conduct

20
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,960
ecp 54 is maybe important

21
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,960
it's talking about how people

22
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,799
should behave in working groups and be

23
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,759
civil and focus on technical discussions

24
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,439
and so on and

25
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,439
thinking we are doing a great job but

26
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,280
you know atf in general there are

27
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,598
sometimes problems with

28
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,599
you know having good civil discussions

29
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,760
and there's other good information here

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,160
as well

31
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,800
all right

32
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,920
them for our agenda

33
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,440
uh it's a bit smaller agenda this time

34
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,760
um

35
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,879
so um

36
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,480
yeah

37
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,840
i'm gonna present a draft and

38
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,879
and there's

39
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,080
three other people presenting as well um

40
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,200
any comments on this agenda

41
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,040
so one thing to note here is there's no

42
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,480
um

43
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,560
we have had some presentations recently

44
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,760
on

45
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
on multicast and

46
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,440
source routing

47
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,159
uh there's no that on well there's one

48
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,000

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,400
but there's a side meeting on friday um

50
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,599

51
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,319
those topics it's not like an official

52
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,879
ietf session but it's an

53
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,760
open meeting to everyone

54

55
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,400

56
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,680

all right so i want to go on with the

59
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,319
working group status

60
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,400
hey hey hey uh steak it might be just

61
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,080
good if you sent that to that link to

62
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,560
the pim list as well

63
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,159
right

64
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,400
yeah sure uh we can do that yeah

65
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,120
okay thank you

66
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,799
uh yeah

67
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,159
okay for the working group status um

68
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,400
there is uh the

69
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
the pym yang model

70
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,720
which has been in the re rfc editor's

71
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,519
queue for a few years it seems like but

72
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,120
that should be published in a few days

73
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,840
now from what i understand it's uh

74
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,599
it's it's like going through the final

75
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,640
review right before publication

76
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,100
this is the igp mld sweeping young model

77
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,299
[Music]

78
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,600
that's in the rfc editors queue as well

79
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,520
let's see did alvaro join the queue

80
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,720
just for a second he backed out

81
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,160
uh alvaro

82
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,520
he sent a link to the chat i think

83
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,000
that's what he wanted to do hey uh no no

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,600
i yeah i got on the queue i got off

85
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,360
because i i saw ac you thought i wanted

86
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,440
i thought he wanted to say something

87
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,880
and i think maybe we're going to see the

88
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,919
same thing

89
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,360
uh or hopefully we're going to see the

90
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,240
same thing

91
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,880
um yeah the ping yang model is in the

92
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,720
our mosquitoes it has been there for a

93
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,560
while

94
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,479
there was a very late uh bug found

95
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,039
not in the pim module

96
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,520
but in the bfd module

97
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,919
that pim imports and

98
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,479
etc so that affects only pim it affects

99
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,479
ospf and isis which are also in the

100
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,840
editors queue

101
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,520
uh the problem the bigger problem is

102
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,199
that vfd was already published as an rrc

103
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,000
so

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,280
we have been

105
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,400
talking to all the authors to see how

106
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,880
well what is the best way to fix this

107
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,600
um right now um

108
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,080
uh rob wilton who's the

109
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,120
op cd is talking to the yang doctors

110
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
to figure out what's the best way where

111
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,639
we think the cleanest way is is to

112
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,560
republish

113
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,320
rfc 91

114
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,120
27 i think is what the bfd

115
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,560
module is

116
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,919
and

117
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:48,639
the

118
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,320
intent would be to you know fast track

119
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,840
that as much as possible because

120
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,919
apparently there are no implementations

121
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,639
and then uh and have the other documents

122
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,160
including the pin module uh your

123
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,560
published um

124
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,639
essays or as they are right with with

125
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,440
with

126
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,280
no changes so that only the only changes

127
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,680
are in the bfd module so in any case uh

128
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,680
that's a long story to say that it may

129
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,840
not be in the next few days uh it may be

130
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,440
hopefully the next few weeks

131
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,600
uh hopefully not it won't go in two

132
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,520
months or anything anything like that

133
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,160
but but uh i think i sent you guys an

134
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,080
email at some point um

135
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,759
maybe the last couple of days i know

136
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,280
it's been busy but yeah just take a look

137
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,880
at that

138
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,319
okay great yeah thank you

139
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,880
yeah so it's not our fault it's all

140
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,919
external references um

141
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,080
all right um

142
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,039
so

143
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,319
uh

144
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,280
we recently requested publication of the

145
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,400
bfd point to multi-point use case

146
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,520
that's being evaluated um well actually

147
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,319
it's it's i guess right before last itf

148
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,039
we requested that um

149
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,840
then um more recently we request

150
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,319
requested publication for rgmp mlb

151
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,000
extensions

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
uh so there was an ad yeah alvaro

153
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,360
reviewed that and uh

154
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,120
yeah i'm one of the offers and i

155
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,680
submitted a new draft just now

156
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,479
so

157
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,960
we'll see how that goes

158
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,080
um

159
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,759
then we have two working group drafts

160
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,360
now on the

161
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,960
dr improvement or backup vr or sticky vr

162
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,440
behavior

163
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,000
so for this we we really need to make

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,319
some progress and

165
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,720
uh we've been thinking about yeah having

166
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,319
you know how to have some good working

167
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,919
with discussion on this um

168
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,440
so

169
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,360
i think for next slide jeff we should

170
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
try to

171
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,720
try to make some progress here

172
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,360
find some way to compare the approaches

173
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,280
and have some discussion about how to

174
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,239
proceed in the working group

175
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,240
yeah because we're at the authors are

176
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,319
really driving these efforts if they're

177
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,280
not

178
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,879
driving it then it's going to kind of

179
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,800
fall by the wayside and we agreed at the

180
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,879
beginning that

181
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,120
we don't have to progress both drafts

182
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,800
because they're similar you know we

183
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,599
talked about whether to merge or to

184
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,039
leave them separate and so far as a

185
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,800
working group we decided to adopt them

186
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,199
separately but if there's not a

187
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,160
if there's not progress

188
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,280
on these drafts then um one of them or

189
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,520
both of them are gonna just kind of die

190
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,800
off

191
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,320
and that's a good point alvaro

192
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
yeah so ultimately we we want to find

193
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,440
out you know what

194
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,519
what are the right technical solutions

195
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,519
do we need one solution do we need two

196
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,720
solutions

197
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,200
but what what do we think is the best

198
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,680
and then based on that we will decide

199
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,920
you know how to progress with

200
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,399
each draft above drafts or or a new

201
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,279
draft or whatever

202
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,920
the main thing is that to come to

203
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,720
agreement on the technical

204
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,000
the protocol aspects

205
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,519
okay

206
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,160
uh let's see okay yeah we also have um

207
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,560
uh igp mld proxy

208
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,279
young model um it passed working group

209
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,040
last call and uh

210
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,480
i'll learn

211
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,600
oh request publications sometime

212
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,560
next week or so

213
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,040
let's see we also have null register

214
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,760
packing um

215
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,839
we had some issues at first with that

216
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,080
the quality wasn't

217
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,560
it wasn't good enough

218
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,200
it had some shortcomings

219
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,040
so it was returned to the working group

220
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,959
but after that we have a pretty good

221
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,800
review by several work group members

222
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,600
some

223
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,920
discussions and also by the routing

224
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,519
directorate

225
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,320
so um

226
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,839
yeah

227
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,600
mike is driving that well i believe we

228
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,800
are

229
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,800
about request publication for that

230
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,360
um

231
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,519
then there's an assert packing draft um

232
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,270
so uh

233
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,519
[Music]

234
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,519
yeah most worker plus call comments were

235
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,480
addressed i had a few just a few minor

236
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,160
comments that i

237
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,600
think should be addressed before

238
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,079
publication um

239
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,399
so once those are addressed i'll go

240
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,000
ahead and

241
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,040
yeah request publication of that as well

242
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,360
then we have the point-to-point star

243
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,600
point-to-point multi-uh point to

244
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,320
multi-point policy which we will discuss

245
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,279
this meeting and also um

246
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,320
you are doing some work on progressing

247
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,200
igp with 3ml2 to internet standard and

248
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,440
we'll have a presentational discussion

249
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,959
about that

250
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,880
um

251
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,770
the next one actually uh

252
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,240
[Music]

253
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,800
yeah we want to

254
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,720
consider progressing that as well we

255
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,640
discussed at the last meeting but not

256
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,480
this meeting

257
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,959
so we'll get back to that later

258
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,519
and then we have this lisp john poon

259
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,920
extensions that was just adopted and we

260
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,279
also will discuss today

261
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,640
one thing we don't have on here is the

262
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,160
draft that you recently called a uh

263
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,959
adoption call for humans uh

264
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,800
point to multi-point ping

265
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,920
uh right

266
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,240
draft

267
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,200
which um

268
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,040
it looks like we are

269
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,600
good to adopt as far as consensus is

270
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,760
concerned however

271
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,079
we did receive a comment that it would

272
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,399
be helpful in that draft human if you're

273
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,560
hearing this that to

274
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,639
specify whether

275
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,680
this is

276
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,200
focused on

277
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,160
the sr mpls data plane

278
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,360
or the and or the srv6 data plane and to

279
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,079
specify that in the draft

280
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,040
and

281
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,800
it was also requested that before we

282
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,760
adopt it that we ping the mpls working

283
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,240
group just as a cc at least the uh the

284
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,600
chairs

285
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,839
so that they know that we're using their

286
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:16,959
code point

287
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,600
in this draft so um

288
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,399
does that make sense human

289
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,320
sorry can can you guys hear me now

290
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,279
yeah

291
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,320
okay yeah that makes sense my apologies

292
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,600
i

293
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,480
i forgot to add that comment i i think

294
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,720
we need to

295
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,000
start with srm pls

296
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
as

297
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,560
the multi-point policy yeah that that

298
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,079
was something i missed i i will

299
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,680
definitely add that

300
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,839
yeah

301
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,320
that'd be great if you can update that

302
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,120
and then um

303
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,959
and then we will

304
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,800
just uh stick and i will do the thing

305
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,920
that we need to do with the other work

306
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,639
group chairs and then we will uh likely

307
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,040
uh make an adoption

308
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,279
uh yeah we'll send it we'll send you an

309
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,560
email on the list that's saying okay

310
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,720
it's go ahead and clear the

311
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,320
submit as a pin working group document

312
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,560
now

313
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,720
thank you

314
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,079
then we're working on updating the

315
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,120
charter mike do you want to

316
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,040
take that

317
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,320
yeah so

318
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,160
just good segue is that we uh as agreed

319
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,519
with the

320
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,399
spring chairs over the last year or two

321
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,680
we are doing

322
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,639
uh

323
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,839
sr point to multiply work in pim

324
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,519
for a variety of reasons including

325
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,760
springs just very busy and they

326
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,680
prefer to have us do it

327
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,399
so we have adopted a draft and it looks

328
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,399
like we'll be dropping adopting a second

329
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,880
draft

330
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,079
there are

331
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,279
other working groups working on

332
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,360
point-to-multi-point related work as

333
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,639
well including bass and idr

334
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,120
they will likely

335
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,560
keep that work

336
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,600
but

337
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
there had been the discussion on whether

338
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,120
we should

339
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,199
take on that work as well

340
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,000
to kind of make it consolidated into one

341
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,240
working group

342
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,079
but for now

343
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,120
that work

344
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,959
appears to be remaining in those other

345
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,680
working groups and

346
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,600
it would be helpful if we at least be

347
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,519
aware of those works and stig and i will

348
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,279
do our best to make this working group

349
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,440
aware of uh point of multiplayer work

350
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,800
going on in other working groups so we

351
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,079
can

352
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,320
add our expertise

353
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,399
and comments to help them to make sure

354
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,480
it jives with our

355
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,399
our protocols

356
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,000
uh any questions so far

357
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,959
comments about that

358
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,320
okay

359
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,440
so

360
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,680
uh

361
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,160
we will be sending we were intending to

362
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,680
have this done by this

363
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,760
this itf but uh because of what i just

364
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,639
described we were not able to to

365
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,480
solidify it but

366
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,040
uh so far we have this

367
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,880
charter update everything's the same

368
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,120
except we did remove the first

369
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,680
bullet with regards to um

370
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,920
management and yang

371
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,839
and we removed that because as far as we

372
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,880
know the yang work is basically done if

373
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,560
that is that does that sound correct to

374
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,959
everybody

375
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,480
okay

376
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,160
so nobody's jumping in and you'll have a

377
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,920
comment to

378
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,079
opportunity to come on the list too um

379
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,800
so we kept the rest that is already in

380
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,240
our charter

381
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,000
and then added this

382
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,920
last bullet so remove that one bullet

383
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,680
and added this one which is to develop

384
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,560
point-to-multipoint protocols

385
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,279
uh this includes sr srv6 point to

386
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,959
multipoint work per agreement with the

387
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,959
spring working group

388
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,480
um

389
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,320
and this may also require other point to

390
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,160
multiply protocols as requested from

391
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,240
other working groups which kind of keeps

392
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,720
it open to if they do want us to take on

393
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,480
that work that we can

394
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,160
do so

395
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,680
so that's really the main thing that we

396
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,440
wanted to make sure that we're all aware

397
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,120
of that it's already been an

398
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,560
understanding that we're taking on this

399
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,440
work

400
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,120
specifically from spring but we wanted

401
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,040
to make it more formal

402
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,959
and then the rest of the charter stands

403
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,800
as is

404
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
which is to comment about aligning and

405
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,720
working with other working groups

406
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,680
any

407
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,959
comments about this charter update

408
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,320
yes alvaro

409
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,000
so you already uh you mentioned some of

410
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,240
the other work in other places and that

411
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,600
side meeting that's happening on friday

412
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,359
so you know in general the charter looks

413
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,760
fine to me i think that we're gonna want

414
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,119
to

415
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,400
look at that other work on friday

416
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,240
uh sync with all the other chairs to

417
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,559
make sure that you know we all have uh

418
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,199
all our ducks in a row

419
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,359
we do need um

420
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,640
better coordination across working

421
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,720
groups and you know that's one item that

422
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,919
i think

423
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,000
we are seeing very much right now with

424
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,080
multicast

425
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,160
but that happens in other cases as well

426
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,240
where we see multiple

427
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,559
types of work or multiple work that in

428
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,720
this case uh refers to the architecture

429
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,160
being worked here

430
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,080
we see work in idr we see working best

431
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,480
we see work in pce and other places that

432
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,000
all refer to the architecture but that

433
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,400
are different solutions so we want to

434
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,799
make sure that we coordinate that um so

435
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,960
as far as the charter uh sure i mean we

436
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,200
should probably start discussing that uh

437
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,840
we probably don't won't want to you know

438
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,080
progress it until we have all the other

439
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,240
ducks in mind so that we do this just

440
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,960
once right and not have to maybe do it

441
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,760
twice or whatever so at that time um and

442
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,280
hopefully we can get that done in the

443
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,360
next

444
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,320
few weeks as well so that uh we are all

445
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,160
in in agreement on what's going to

446
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,080
happen and who's going to coordinate and

447
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,200
and all those other things

448
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,440
great

449
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,440
thank you uh

450
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,679
hi june

451
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,559
hello

452
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,000
hi go ahead

453
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,720
yeah

454
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,280
uh for uh for for sr based uh p2mt uh

455
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,679
solution i i think the

456
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,760
the sr based uh multicast solution is

457
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,600
different from the team protocol so

458
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,440
my recommendation is

459
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,520
we can consider with

460
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,760
the side media that will be held in

461
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,840
friday for the msr

462
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,240
side meeting you know uh the other

463
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,559
related all these are released

464
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,240
multicast workers i think it should be

465
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,640
included in my new new working group

466
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,720
okay

467
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,520
okay thank you so we can

468
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,840
discuss that all at that site meeting

469
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,159
thank you

470
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,120
yes alvaro

471
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,360
what stay already said before which is

472
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,360
the site meeting is not an official atf

473
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,240
uh

474
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,440
meeting right

475
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,600
so you can discuss anything you want uh

476
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,840
we still need to agree

477
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,760
uh in the atf

478
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,600
where and how anything's going to be

479
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,200
done right

480
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,600
everyone knows here that we

481
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
need to look at charters and you know

482
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,960
everything else

483
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,000
if there is work which hasn't been

484
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,039
presented anywhere in the atf yet

485
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,960
to be done in a new working group sure

486
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,400
we can consider that

487
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
um if the work of course overlaps with

488
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,520
other things

489
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,360
uh we can do it in in you know other

490
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,000
places uh just a reminder to everyone uh

491
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,720
this working group is called pim not

492
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,559
because of the protocol

493
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,559
but because of how you know what it says

494
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,400
in the charter here on the slide this is

495
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,720
called protocols for ip multicast

496
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,520
not protocol independent multicast

497
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,360
we chartered this

498
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,200
what four or five years ago

499
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,880
to on purpose

500
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,039
be able to increase the scope if

501
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,039
necessary now that doesn't mean that

502
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,240
everything that has to do with

503
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,559
multitasking has to go here right uh it

504
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,480
just means that that we need to to

505
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,679
discuss that

506
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,440
and uh as with everything you know

507
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,039
things need to be presented in the atf

508
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,120
we need to discuss charters uh yeah et

509
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,400
cetera right it's not just uh

510
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,440
unfortunately not everything is

511
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,679
automatic as as it should be

512
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,440
okay thanks

513
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,360
yeah thank you yeah so there's been many

514
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,960
comments about the side meeting i think

515
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,520
we should regularly do side meetings

516
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,520
that just don't fit within a working

517
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,480
group time period um jake holland had an

518
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,000
interesting one last ietf

519
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,320
and i've already from a side meeting

520
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,720
that i attended this week uh yesterday

521
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,640
uh on addressing i already had an idea

522
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,280
that i think i may want to

523
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,480
present along with dino um on dlts and

524
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,000
an ipa multicast so i think side

525
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,840
meetings hopefully are becoming like a

526
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,200
multicast related side meetings

527
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,640
hopefully become a regular thing that we

528
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,720
do

529
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,280
to kind of just brainstorm on

530
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,000
things like this so

531
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,320
yeah great

532
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,080
any other comments before we move along

533
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,439
to the rest of the agenda

534
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,799
okay

535
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,440
i think stig you are

536
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,880
all right

537
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,039
so um

538
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,159
yeah so uh let's be one with the agenda

539
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,159
uh

540
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,159
so

541
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,679
let's see

542
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,240
yeah so just to remind people this is

543
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,559
the agenda so i'll start out with now

544
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,799
with this and then

545
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,360
uh yeah that will just be just a few

546
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,280
minutes and then

547
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,919
you can go next stop for me

548
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,640
okay let's see the slides here

549
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,960
all right so um

550
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,919
um

551
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,320
this is the drone print attributes for

552
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,640
lisp environments using underlay

553
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,320
multicast

554
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,159
so um there was a draft in the

555
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,880
pin working group some years back uh

556
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,200
defining these attributes

557
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,559
um

558
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,760
the only thing is that

559
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
the attributes could be used for to

560
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,960
specify a unicast destination for like

561
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,720
ingress replication

562
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,520
but as defined they couldn't be used for

563
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,600
underlay multicast so

564
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,520
what this draft is doing is basically

565
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,200
saying that you can

566
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,919
also specify a multicast address as a

567
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,919
destination address

568
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:12,880
um

569
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,200
for lisp and cap

570
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,799
so um

571
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,440
this draft was presented in uh let me go

572
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,080
to the next slide

573
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,720
draft was presented in both pim and lisp

574
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,600
last itf and

575
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,200
it was agreed with this working group

576
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,840
that the work could be done in him

577
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,520
just like last time

578
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,840
but we reviewed by this parking group

579
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,480
so

580
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,400
yeah it has recently been adopted

581
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,520
i'm one of the authors and

582
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,919
it's a very simple document

583
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,559
we offers believe that the main

584
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,480
thing we need to work on is the security

585
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,760
considerations otherwise we feel it's

586
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,960
already fairly complete

587
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,320
but um

588
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,520
okay um yeah so

589
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,200
let's see um looking for

590
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,360
okay yeah i have a couple of slides here

591
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,200
that can remind people what this is

592
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,520
about but i feel like i already said

593
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,720
basically what there is to say

594
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,799
it's about getting this across a

595
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,520
multicast core network we need to

596
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,679
specify the um

597
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,640
online multicast address

598
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,679
and

599
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,000
basically using that existing tlv just

600
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,799
specifying that a multicast group can be

601
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,360
specif can be used

602
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,039
that's all we are doing in this draft

603
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,320
so uh yeah we're hoping to get some

604
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,480
comments review from the working group

605
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,679
and uh

606
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:52,960
you will work on the security

607
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,120
considerations and uh

608
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,360
hopefully we can do a loss call soon

609
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,919
but yeah i'm hoping by it by the next

610
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,720
itf that we can get some comments and

611
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,360
hopefully be in good good shape by next

612
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,760
item

613
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,159
that's all i have any questions

614
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,159
can you put your pen hat back on so

615
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,720
uh just from a why well while we were

616
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,400
talking about pen rechartering um

617
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,039
do we need to add anything about

618
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,039
lisp related work or do you think this

619
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,120
is just kind of a one-off

620
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,400
we do have

621
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,720
in our charter at the end they we

622
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,400
mentioned working with other working

623
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,840
groups including lisp do you think

624
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,200
that's good enough

625
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,480
for now

626
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,679
right so in this particular case um

627
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,600
uh the reason we're doing it in pim is

628
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,840
that you know it has to do with that pin

629
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,760
joint attribute and that is in our

630
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,320
current charter

631
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,440
so i think you are good there um great

632
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,720
there's been some multicast work done in

633
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,960
the list working group as well

634
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,919
but

635
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,679
it doesn't involve him in any way so

636
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,039
that was done

637
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,919
purely in the list working group

638
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,240
okay

639
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,039
right okay yeah

640
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,440
all right so next step

641
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,000
is uh

642
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,720
multi-point policy

643
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,520
yeah i'll

644
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,440
i'll drive the slides here just tell me

645
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,880
you want to go to the next slide please

646
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,520
if you're talking to him and we can't

647
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,840
hear you

648
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,039
my apologies

649
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,760
so for whatever reason my browser keeps

650
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,399
reloading this webpage um so hopefully

651
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,960
i'm not going to drop off but if i did

652
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,360
that's the reason

653
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,159
so

654
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,559
quickly we wanted to give a quick update

655
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,158
on the point multiplying policy

656
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,600
so i guess we're ready for the next

657
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,918
slide

658
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,880
by the way can can you guys hear me

659
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,240
clearly

660
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,520
yeah

661
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,399
okay

662
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,360
um

663
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,080
so

664
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,720
as of now the replication segment is

665
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,440
obviously adopted by the uh sr

666
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,480
uh and this working group has adopted

667
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,720
the point to multiplying policy i'll

668
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,159
give you a little bit of update what has

669
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,919
changed in that draft

670
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,840
um i'm not going to talk too much about

671
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,679
the end there hasn't been too much churn

672
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,120
on the yang and eventually i think

673
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,120
next itf and

674
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,279
present them to the appropriate working

675
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,520
group based on the

676
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,240
the yang um so that's one thing we have

677
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,159
talked about unfortunately i haven't

678
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,240
done it so far i'll do that for the next

679
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,520
idea

680
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,320
um

681
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,640
when it comes to the

682
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,520
best in vpn evpn sr point to multiply

683
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,640
policy uh so that's the bgp signaling

684
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,000
layer um

685
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,360
for the services

686
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,880
uh that

687
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,240
work is somewhat complete

688
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,840
we can

689
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,640
signal the services over a point to

690
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,960
multiplying policy between two pe's

691
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,840
from the pce

692
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,799
point of view and nailing down the point

693
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,559
to multiple point three

694
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,600
on the on the routers

695
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
we went through some changes in the

696
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,399
draft

697
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,640
i'm not going to get into the detail

698
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,200
there was a adoption call

699
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,399
which was had a majority

700
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,640
and they should be it should be adopted

701
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,679
by november 25th unless if there are any

702
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,679
other comments that would come in i

703
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,120
don't foresee that so it should be a

704
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,960
smooth sailing

705
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,720
the next one is the

706
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,080
idr

707
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,880
uh for star point to multiply policy so

708
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,039
basically what this is is

709
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,919
a bgp srte

710
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,679
trying to nail down the the tree

711
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,440
obviously we have bgp into the routers

712
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,320
we try to keep it

713
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,799
just uh

714
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,480
it's not it's not just me

715
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,320
like every minute or so your audio just

716
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,480
uh disappears for like 10 seconds so i

717
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,399
don't know if there's

718
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,440
anything you can do on your end

719
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,960
especially since you're giving another

720
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,480
presentation after this one so just yeah

721
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,159
maybe maybe i'll get to my 5g network if

722
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,080
it's any better than this

723
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,279
um

724
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,320
like right now

725
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,039
it comes and goes

726
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,360
if this is not useful and i and i keep

727
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,960
disappearing

728
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,480
i i suggest to go to the next

729
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,000
presentation i don't know whether

730
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,320
everything is

731
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,880
yeah we didn't just we didn't hear any

732
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,399
of that last uh 20 seconds

733
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,840
okay so i've got the next example

734
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,840
okay

735
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,240
next slide

736
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,200
the next presentation

737
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,480
next presentation okay

738
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,360
yeah bob i

739
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,120
had that same problem with bluetooth i

740
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,640
had i'm using

741
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,240
hardwired just for that very reason

742
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,240
unfortunately

743
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,439
so we're ready when you are coming

744
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,120
but take your time if you're figuring

745
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,760
out your audio

746
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,360
yeah i think maybe he reloaded i don't

747
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,840
see him on the list here right now yeah

748
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,000
yeah

749
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,399
let's give him a second if he doesn't

750
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,360
come back we can uh

751
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,080
go to the next presentation on

752
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,080
extension source management and then

753
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,639
come back to them

754
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,080
yeah let's

755
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,399
let's do that if that's okay

756
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,360
yeah

757
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,720
uh

758
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,200
yeah i think it um

759
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,039
is it pronounced

760
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,039
on

761
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,840
lee for uh

762
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,600
ig pmld yeah extension

763
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,360
you hear me yeah

764
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,480
yes we hear you

765
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,120
hello everyone i am juan ali from china

766
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,600
telecom i am going to introduce our

767
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,840
updates the next page please

768
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,159
in the last discussion a similar draft

769
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,159
is mentioned named multicast source

770
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,679
notification of interest protocol

771
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:00,360
msnp

772
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,240
msnp is designed around the

773
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,000
premise that you want to minimize source

774
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,480
when no receiver listening

775
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,239
msnip focus focus

776
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,599
primarily on dataflow control or

777
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,520
documents aims at management of

778
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,960
multicast source and related service

779
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,918
including control of multicast source

780
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,320
access which can

781
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,520
improve the security of multicast

782
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,239
control of data flow

783
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,520
which is consist consistent

784
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,800
with the

785
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,079
idea of

786
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,040
ms

787
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
nip

788
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,879
management of money casters statistics

789
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,839
with controller

790
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,879
and other uses can be extended based on

791
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,839
source registration

792
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:04,640
in addition both msnip and our document

793
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,640
is designed for ssm scenario

794
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,119
if these solutions

795
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,280
are to be applied in esm scenario maybe

796
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,440
other multicast protocols such as

797
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,760
protocol independent

798
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,960
multicast

799
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,880
need to be consid

800
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,000
need to be considered together

801
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,680
we will have made some updates to our

802
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,560
document in reference to

803
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,079
comments

804
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,640
in last discussion and the process of

805
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:45,160
msnip expat thank you

806
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,960
next page thank you

807
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,440
sorry sorry

808
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,720
the first is updates

809
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,560
the first update

810
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,480
is updated for multicast source

811
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,560
registration process

812
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,680
after receiving the

813
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,400
gesture message from the source system

814
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,400
and authenticate authenticating

815
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,040
the router views and multicast source

816
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,119
registration messages

817
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,480
with valid registration status response

818
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,200
to the source system and inform the

819
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,240
source systems that the requests are

820
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,880
approved the router

821
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,079
then the router will trigger a timer and

822
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,920
maintain the

823
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,079
registration status

824
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,040
for the source systems until the timer

825
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,960
expires

826
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,760
the source systems need

827
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,960
pretty

828
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,160
periodically send registration message

829
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,359
to the routers to inform the router that

830
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,640
the multicast source is alive

831
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,400
then routers will refresh the timer

832
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,599
of the registration status

833
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,800
if the router receives multicast data

834
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,880
from the multicast source they will

835
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,000
refresh the timer during the data

836
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,520
delivery the source systems does not

837
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,599
have to send

838
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,520
registration message

839
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,520
periodically

840
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,280
when the timer expires

841
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,520
or the validated

842
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,680
periodical

843
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,560
registration expires

844
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,280
the router will release the registration

845
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,320
states and send a multicast

846
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,800
resource registration message with

847
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,320
invalid states to the source system to

848
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,480
inform it

849
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,359
next page thank you

850
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,520
for multicast

851
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,240
source registration message

852
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,920
and

853
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,480
the update is

854
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,400
the credentials is extended to

855
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,079
16 bits in addition to

856
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,400
earned timestamps

857
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,079
times stamp is replaced by three by the

858
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,960
duration the start time and the duration

859
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,520
are not related to the timer mentioned

860
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,560
in the process

861
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,320
start time

862
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,599
timestamps indicates the start time

863
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,040
when the multicast source can prove

864
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,839
can provide a service for multicast

865
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,440
approves

866
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,839
before this time router don't send the

867
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,200
multicast

868
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,480
data

869
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,800
notification message to the source

870
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,800
system

871
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,200
duration indicates the maximum

872
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,400
duration that the multicast source can

873
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,280
provide service for the multicast

874
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,240
group

875
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,040
you know valid registration request

876
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,240
next page thank you

877
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,760
for all messages defined in this

878
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,800
document the address type field was

879
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,920
removed

880
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,680
if this message are used to ignp message

881
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,280
the corresponding

882
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,640
address are

883
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,160
ipvs addresses if this method are used

884
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,839
to mld messages the corresponding

885
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:34,480
addresses are ipivalio addresses

886
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,599
next page thank you

887
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,560
we add a new section to introduce use

888
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,480
cases and place multicast source

889
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,079
management for pce based beer solution

890
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,400
in this section

891
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,079
such as in

892
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,760
sdn

893
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,000
to unify the money

894
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,119
management of multicast information

895
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,119
based on the controller

896
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,480
source excise authentication

897
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,640
that float transmission control

898
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,079
and the

899
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,280
receiver information management can be

900
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,800
realized

901
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,160
and the ability of multicast network

902
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,200
service awareness can be

903
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,839
improved

904
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,000
other use case will be added in the in

905
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,800
future updates

906
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,280
and that's the main content

907
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,880
of our presentation any comments on your

908
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,680
work

909
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,598
our work welcome thank you

910
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,839
yeah so thank you very much

911
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,760
are you requesting anything of the

912
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,640
working group at this time

913
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,598
other than comets

914
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,960
stig or anybody

915
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:19,359
uh

916
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,760
well i can mention that uh

917
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,960
yeah i'm like

918
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,599
i joined as a co-author and i have some

919
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,040
contents that i plan to add on use cases

920
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,079
and uh

921
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,599
yeah

922
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:32,720
some more work

923
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,200
to be done okay

924
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,720
last uh itf you mentioned uh m snip was

925
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,560
there ever like a

926
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,280
comparison to see if

927
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,510
the work done in the past

928
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,760
[Music]

929
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,400
uh applies to this

930
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,680
um

931
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,160
it's this at least from protocol point

932
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,079
of view i feel

933
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:54,960
uh

934
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,280
that the main thing is this you know

935
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,760
basically that the source can notify

936
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,760
that it wants to be a

937
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,760
wants to sell multicast and that there's

938
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,960
a way for the

939
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,599
router to respond back to the source

940
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,280
with some information right about

941
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,000
receivers and so on and that's common in

942
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,400
both of these drafts of m snip and this

943
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,359
draft

944
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,720
but the motivation is is different and

945
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,560
um

946
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,480
yeah i think we have several use cases

947
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,960
that are not mentioned back

948
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,079
in the m step draft

949
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,839
there's some differences too like this

950
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,480
job talks about uh i mean there's like

951
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,640
credentials and you can announce like

952
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,319
start time and someone that was not

953
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,440
there in amsterdam

954
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,440
okay

955
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,800
hi june do you have a comment

956
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,079
uh

957
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,800
hello yeah we have compared

958
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,000
with the

959
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,680
msi team

960
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,359
and this software and

961
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,520
their aim is

962
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,240
a similar bosom to control the

963
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,200
the

964
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,880
behavior of yourself not as a source

965
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,480
i think

966
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,440
we can

967
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,280
cooperate

968
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,240
and

969
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,440
under the

970
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,720
that messenger used msnp in the left

971
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,640
update so we also

972
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,200
understood as a closure to put for this

973
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,480
job

974
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,520
and we

975
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,359
in the either

976
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,640
can't update the person we have

977
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,040
also adopted the command from the from

978
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,880
stick for the

979
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,000
encoding of the message and for the

980
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,960
timer

981
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,200
timer control for the register timer

982
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,800
control etc okay

983
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,920
okay ac

984
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,400
cisco systems can you hear me

985
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,079
yes you can we can't now

986
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,960
no yeah it it asked me to allow every

987
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,839
time i turn my audio on i don't know why

988
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,440
uh

989
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,119
the

990
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,560
the primary

991
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:07,119
motivation for this would be one you can

992
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,920
do credential validation of the sources

993
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,960
and number two you can tell the sources

994
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,720
to quit sending when there are

995
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,640
absolutely no receivers is that what it

996
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,800
is

997
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,440
are those the two main uh two main

998
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,599
advantages why you'd want to go through

999
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,119
this complexity

1000
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,160
is that

1001
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,480
correct

1002
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,279
yeah

1003
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,040
yeah uh i i think yeah yeah correct the

1004
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,760
main goal of this

1005
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,680
result is to

1006
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,160
the first thing is to authenticate the

1007
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,480
multicultural source we want to

1008
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,960
deploy the multicast

1009
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,160
in the control manner so not every not

1010
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,119
uh

1011
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,599
any source can send the mouse password

1012
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,400
for the network this is the first uh

1013
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,200
first thing the second name we want to

1014
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,920
feedback some more information for the

1015
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,640
receiver i think this is the popular

1016
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,040
multicast application

1017
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,640
this is the

1018
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,880
main aim of this

1019
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,200
quarterback

1020
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,480
although we can under other

1021
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,599
[Music]

1022
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,240
capabilities especially in the msrp

1023
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,560
later

1024
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,440
yeah

1025
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,240
from yeah the way i see this you know we

1026
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,839
had

1027
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,000
the main complexity in multicast is

1028
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,839
often the source discovery and we have

1029
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,960
lots of different ways of doing that and

1030
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,359
it's usually been like some dynamic

1031
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,440
discovery mechanism

1032
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,240
but we can simplify discovery

1033
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,200
a lot

1034
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,800
if we actually

1035
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,280
have some signaling other source rather

1036
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,839
than having like data driven

1037
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,400
signaling

1038
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,720
okay okay thank you uh

1039
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,480
i guess maybe you could look at things

1040
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,040
where you eliminate the rp and go right

1041
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,040
to source pacific with this

1042
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,359
right

1043
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,000
yeah

1044
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,599
sorry i didn't get the losses you could

1045
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,440
look at flows where you don't rp list

1046
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,200
flows where you just go you just have

1047
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,960
the registration of the sources and the

1048
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,359
receivers and don't even bother with

1049
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,960
asm right

1050
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,880
right

1051
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,240
i think that would yeah that would be

1052
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,359
more

1053
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,280
deterministic i think

1054
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,839
i agree

1055
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,000
thanks

1056
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,690
all right anything else on this track

1057
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:46,400
[Music]

1058
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,200
yes satoshi

1059
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,720
[Music]

1060
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,319
i

1061
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,599
didn't leave this draft so

1062
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,480
um i may miss the point but uh

1063
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,920
why

1064
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,400
this draft

1065
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,079
wants to use igmp or mld for source

1066
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,520
discovery

1067
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,400
so

1068
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,520
um maybe there was a next time

1069
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,319
i may clarify the more

1070
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,520
uh difference about uh between ms nip

1071
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,880
and

1072
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,480
this draft because

1073
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,000
in fact i couldn't understand the clear

1074
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,119
difference between ims and ipad this

1075
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,319
draft

1076
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,000
but in any case so why uh you need to

1077
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,119
use igmp or mle because igpmla is

1078
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,319
usually or in general used for the

1079
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,280
receiver protocol so why

1080
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,200
you need to

1081
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,559
extend

1082
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,400
ignp mld for source discovery and for

1083
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,119
the source discovery if we talk about a

1084
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,200
very old

1085
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,760
protocol we already have

1086
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,280
sap sap

1087
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,680
of course sap is not perfect profitable

1088
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,760
so that's why

1089
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,640
maybe

1090
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,680
recently no one has been

1091
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,960
using

1092
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,000
uh sap but sap itself can become as

1093
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,680
something like a source

1094
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,079
uh notification so you can extend sap

1095
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,079
even if you want to

1096
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,200
enhance some credential approach

1097
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,119
uh for source discovery so my question

1098
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:33,200
is why you need to use or need to extend

1099
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,839
or medley

1100
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,599
go ahead and answer that

1101
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:40,720
yeah

1102
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,160
i try to answer

1103
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,760
uh

1104
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:49,520
i i i i'm not aware with the

1105
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,160
the protocol between the horse standard

1106
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,319
and its first road router

1107
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:03,119
you know the the allies

1108
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,319
responsible i say the main protocol of

1109
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,720
the main proposal of reserve is to

1110
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,319
authenticate the the multiple source not

1111
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,400
not the

1112
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,960
firing source really in the network you

1113
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,319
know so uh

1114
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:19,520
uh

1115
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,000
for authenticated resource it is

1116
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,040
a must depend on the protocol at the

1117
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,920
layers between the host

1118
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,680
and the first router so ignp and ambi is

1119
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,640
in the best selection for such control

1120
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,839
you know uh we we don't want to solve

1121
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:38,559
the

1122
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,040
uh source recovery within uh within the

1123
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,880
network

1124
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,240
and missing the by finance currently we

1125
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:53,280
focus on the ssn sm ssm scenario so

1126
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,200
there is no rp

1127
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,040
in the network

1128
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,839
okay

1129
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,119
money

1130
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,520
um yeah it seems like um

1131
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,079
this idea of kind of request to send

1132
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,480
where the sender actually requests to

1133
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,640
send something into the network um it

1134
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,839
feels like this is an old idea uh and

1135
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,920
i remember it being abandoned a long

1136
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,200
time ago

1137
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,400
but i

1138
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,200
i remember m snip um not getting much

1139
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,280
traction um

1140
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,359
i i think i'm not old enough to remember

1141
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,920
why rts died i think that might have

1142
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,880
been

1143
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,559
a little bit before my time but i'd be

1144
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,800
curious if anybody can remember you know

1145
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,640
this isn't the first time that this

1146
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,319
concept has come out it you know it was

1147
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,000
an idea from a long time ago and does

1148
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,240
anybody remember why it was abandoned

1149
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:48,490
and

1150
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:50,000
[Music]

1151
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,359
decided not to pursue

1152
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,880
or is everybody else too young to

1153
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,839
remember

1154
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,480
right yeah at least i would say i

1155
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,280
i don't remember um

1156
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,720
but

1157
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,800
at least the main challenge i see is you

1158
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,720
know deployment

1159
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,440
it's very hard to get hosts upgraded to

1160
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,880
support

1161
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,319
something like this so even you know

1162
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:17,040
like going from igp with two to three or

1163
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:17,920
seven

1164
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,559
two years and years

1165
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,040
but i at least i imagine it could be

1166
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,359
useful in some special

1167
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:28,000
i don't know some special cases maybe

1168
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,599
not like you know like

1169
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,920
generic windows through linux but maybe

1170
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,280
let's say

1171
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,480
cameras with ip support or i don't know

1172
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,960
it could be more specialized

1173
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,000
use cases perhaps

1174
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,680
but at least that's a big challenge is

1175
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,359
how do you get something like this into

1176
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:49,480
like host stacks in general

1177
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,119
yeah brian haberman probably would

1178
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,319
remember um

1179
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,359
but

1180
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,520
i would i would guess greg shepard where

1181
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,520
he here would have an opinion yeah

1182
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,839
probably so

1183
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:08,640
yeah go ahead

1184
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,920
uh

1185
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,720
i

1186
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,640
i think uh for

1187
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,280
you know because we want to make the

1188
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,559
the

1189
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,680
smart caster in

1190
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,240
one control manner so we think the

1191
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,000
source must be authenticated and

1192
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,800
controlled so it is different from the

1193
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,559
start point of the ms9 here so i think

1194
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:33,760
we can

1195
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,160
and the source is the number of

1196
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,520
smartphones in limited so i think we can

1197
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,319
the update of the

1198
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,079
may be acceptable

1199
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:44,960
okay

1200
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,559
it is not uh

1201
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,400
like the receiver side so

1202
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,839
so i think we can put for the

1203
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:55,839
implementation

1204
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,440
of the multiple

1205
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,040
multiple sources

1206
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,319
for such protocol extensions

1207
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:05,680
okay this is our main aim for the

1208
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,799
design of this project

1209
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,520
great

1210
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,359
thank you

1211
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,319
i suggest we uh

1212
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,000
communicate more on the list and not

1213
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,240
wait till the next itf to present this

1214
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,839
and let's

1215
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:27,400
see what people think

1216
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,599
other comments before we go back to

1217
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:32,000
human

1218
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,880
all right

1219
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,240
human are you back yes

1220
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,559
can you hear me

1221
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,160
okay

1222
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,879
all right um

1223
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,520
so pim light um

1224
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,440
if you can go to the next uh slide

1225
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,760
please

1226
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:57,200
so the entire idea was born based on the

1227
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,720
last call that we had on the beer

1228
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:03,799
signaling um

1229
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,559
it's breaking up

1230
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,200
yeah but you're back now just well

1231
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,400
i'll just say something when you break

1232
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,400
up and then just pause

1233
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,480
okay sounds good

1234
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,520
maybe

1235
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,400
are you unwired or

1236
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,640
there's construction around so maybe

1237
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,040
they cut something or not you know

1238
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,880
yeah um

1239
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,319
so the

1240
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:37,040
in the beer signaling we

1241
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,319
use the pim join and prunes

1242
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,119
to signal them

1243
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:48,119
you're breaking up

1244
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,680
mike

1245
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,559
i don't

1246
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,000
i don't think it's working because i

1247
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,240
hear my own voice and it keeps breaking

1248
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,399
up

1249
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,079
right

1250
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,480
uh i i apologize i think i'm just gonna

1251
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,599
take away

1252
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,119
time from working group

1253
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,040
i can hear you well most of the time you

1254
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,920
just break up a little occasionally

1255
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,640
all right i i can't continue yeah just

1256
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,160
power through it and we'll just uh

1257
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,599
it seems like your first and last

1258
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:25,280
sentences are audible it's all your

1259
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,680
middle sentences that aren't so stick

1260
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,879
with first and last sentences

1261
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:35,200
okay

1262
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,319
so

1263
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:39,760
basically we want join prunes

1264
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,359
uh without the pim hello to be accepted

1265
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,960
from other routers other peer routers

1266
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,839
so

1267
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:50,079
including the assert messages

1268
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,160
so this is what we're going to call pim

1269
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,839
lite

1270
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:55,839
you don't need to bring up team

1271
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:59,280
adjacency between the routers

1272
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,839
directly connected

1273
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,480
basically without having the pim hello

1274
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,680
you can accept the joins and proven

1275
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:21,599
messages to signal the multicast estates

1276
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,480
next slide please

1277
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,359
so what becomes the limitation

1278
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:35,359
of this pimlight protocol if you will

1279
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:38,160
so the first thing is that obviously you

1280
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:43,160
cannot discover pym neighbors

1281
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,799
dr selection

1282
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:56,319
so there's no ddr priority options

1283
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,880
and obviously since there is no pim

1284
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,160
hello

1285
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,079
you don't create a general purpose state

1286
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,040
for your neighboring pim routers on the

1287
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,759
local router

1288
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,520
i mean these are the main limitations of

1289
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,760
this pim light just simply because there

1290
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,280
is no pin

1291
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,400
hello between adjacent routers

1292
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,400
next

1293
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,440
perfect um

1294
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,559
so

1295
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,760
again it's pim with zero calories we all

1296
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,640
know that pim is complicated the

1297
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,839
protocol

1298
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:49,520
which some networks uh or interface

1299
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,720
types might not be able to support or

1300
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,559
are not optimized

1301
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:57,680
for the pim protocol

1302
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,559
full

1303
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,839
pin protocol itself

1304
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,920
in in the beer network

1305
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,000
where you have

1306
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,520
beer packets going between two pim

1307
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,799
domain

1308
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,200
uh really the beer

1309
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,960
encapsulation is not optimized for

1310
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,400
sending pim hellos and bringing up

1311
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,240
full pim adjacency

1312
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,000
between the two

1313
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,040
pim domains if you will so this pin

1314
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,599
light plays very nicely

1315
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,839
with a

1316
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,400
of networks

1317
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,200
that

1318
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,760
are not optimized for pin

1319
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,799
as well

1320
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:00,319
which this pin light can be used

1321
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,040
next slide please

1322
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,160
so

1323
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,880
obviously we are looking for comments we

1324
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,040
want to make sure that this

1325
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,200
draft is bulletproof that we are

1326
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:17,520
covering all cases corner cases

1327
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:22,000
for having a pim light protocols between

1328
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,280
for the

1329
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,920
comments okay

1330
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,680
not sure how much of that you got but

1331
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,520
that's it we got a lot thanks for

1332
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,400
powering through that

1333
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,400
so one thing that we will

1334
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,400
oh go ahead

1335
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,960
alright let's see let me yeah thanks

1336
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,280
mike uh but i haven't read the document

1337
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,559
but can we

1338
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,319
um

1339
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:57,839
what you're defining here is really a

1340
00:59:57,839 --> 00:59:59,599
different type of interface

1341
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,400
can we actually call the draft not just

1342
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,799
pim lite but pim light interface or

1343
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:06,240
something like that

1344
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,240
so that gives the idea of what we're

1345
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,359
really specifying in it

1346
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:14,000
so please let's take care of that before

1347
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,839
yeah we go further with anything else

1348
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:17,680
thanks and by the way thanks for doing

1349
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,559
this this this work

1350
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:21,920
oh well yeah

1351
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,920
thank you um

1352
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,040
i have no problem calling it team light

1353
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,359
interface

1354
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,000
the only thing we need to think about is

1355
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,599
that

1356
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,240
there are logical interfaces or

1357
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:42,439
physical interfaces or even beer um

1358
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:52,160
you got that last comment so what i was

1359
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,119
saying is that beer doesn't have a

1360
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:59,200
logical pin interface it's really

1361
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,160
we figure out where the source is

1362
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,880
and where is the last beer router

1363
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,200
on the path to the source

1364
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,119
and we send the join

1365
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:12,000
via

1366
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,119
the next beer edge router

1367
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,040
so i have no problem calling it

1368
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,040
interface

1369
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,040
so i said i don't have no problem

1370
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:35,558
calling it a pimlight interface

1371
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,000
yeah we don't know what you're saying

1372
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,160
but it's important

1373
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:47,359
[Laughter]

1374
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:50,319
let me just chime in right now woman and

1375
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:51,839
say that

1376
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:53,280
one thing that is unique about this

1377
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,039
draft is being that stig and i are both

1378
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,440
on it is that we can't call for adoption

1379
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,880
of this draft so we would need to

1380
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,160
have a shepherd

1381
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,920
um

1382
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,599
be as if they're a chair for this

1383
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,440
particular draft and do the calling for

1384
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,359
adoptions um

1385
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,280
and follow this draft throughout

1386
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,119
the life of the draft if it were to be

1387
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:15,359
adopted and do the working group last

1388
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:17,680
call and all that

1389
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,839
so

1390
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:20,400
um

1391
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,440
does

1392
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,280
and we can pull the list and see or just

1393
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,799
find someone and ask him if they do it

1394
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:27,839
but um right now does anybody

1395
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,240
would anybody be willing to to fill that

1396
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,720
role for this draft

1397
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,480
okay

1398
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,720
so we'll find somebody so we can't ask

1399
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,480
for an adoption right now any other

1400
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,520
comments

1401
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,038

1414
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:28,160

1415
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,480
don't see him

1416
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,319
it may still be a little bit too early

1417
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:35,279
we're kind of ahead

1418
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,480
yeah

1419
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,039
uh unleash are you interested and able

1420
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:48,400
to

1421
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,720
to present

1422
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:06,038
yeah and there's a lot hearing you

1423
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,559
have you been on any of the call stick

1424
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:28,319
enough to

1425
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:31,520
give an overview or not

1426
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:40,160
yeah i was checking with um unleash here

1427
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,839
you know if he could do it he has some

1428
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:43,870
audio issues trying to rejoin

1429
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:45,760
[Music]

1430
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,559
but yeah if neither he or brian is here

1431
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:52,240
in a couple of minutes i guess we can

1432
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,640
sort of discuss it

1433
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,559
at least start discussing it without

1434
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,559
them

1435
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,359
oh am i audible now

1436
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:22,119
yeah hi it's working now great

1437
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,680
yeah uh hi uh so

1438
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,559
this presentation is for advancing igmp

1439
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:34,079
v3 and mlv2 to internet standard

1440
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:38,240
uh so in last ietf 111 we also presented

1441
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,200
this at that time we asked for adoption

1442
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,240
and uh now it is a working group draft

1443
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,079
so we

1444
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:49,280
uh submitted the first version with some

1445
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,400
changes

1446
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,119
before the cut off and for both three

1447
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,760
three seven six for ignp v3 and three

1448
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,400
eight one zero for mlt v2

1449
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,760
so i can

1450
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,400
briefly talk about some of the changes

1451
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,200
which we incorporated

1452
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,680
so for 3376

1453
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,680
one of the changes which we did like

1454
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,760
recently there was a query over the

1455
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,000
working group alias regarding the query

1456
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,480
election process which was

1457
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,319
uh being seen and like one of the

1458
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:23,599
implementations where we don't have a

1459
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:25,280
clear way of

1460
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,039
identifying whether

1461
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:28,000
uh

1462
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,760
which query should be used for the

1463
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,359
election process so uh for more details

1464
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:35,760
we can look at the

1465
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,319
emails in the working group and so that

1466
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:41,760
that was one of the issues which got

1467
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,240
incorporated in 3376

1468
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,400
second thing was the

1469
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,039
mld messages being sent with link local

1470
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:52,240
addresses and this is for three eight

1471
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,839
one zero

1472
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:55,599
and

1473
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,760
one of the erratas which was filed

1474
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,440
against three eight one zero uh mld v2

1475
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,280
was the right of four seven seven three

1476
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,119
where it talks about

1477
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:06,400
the missing

1478
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,200
recipe field so that also got

1479
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,760
incorporated in version one

1480
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:12,640
and

1481
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,720
uh one of the older orders which was

1482
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:18,319
filed against three three seven six is

1483
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:20,160
four three seven five where the older

1484
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,559
version query present time of definition

1485
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,039
itself has some discrepancy

1486
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:28,240
so this is also being incorporated and i

1487
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,079
guess we

1488
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:32,880
there is uh another thing missing so

1489
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,799
there is another area which is like kind

1490
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:36,400
of editorial

1491
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,200
uh which is five three seven five

1492
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,359
against uh

1493
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:44,359
ignpv3376rfc

1494
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:48,079
so that is also got incorporated in

1495
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:50,160
version one of three three seven six

1496
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,200
piss

1497
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,640
so we are

1498
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,359
using github and all these issues could

1499
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:57,920
be tracked here so all these issues

1500
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,760
which i just talked about

1501
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,640
are they are present in github and

1502
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,680
that right now markers closed so

1503
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:09,399
on next slide please

1504
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:23,560
i stick

1505
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,759
and next slide

1506
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:34,479
yeah

1507
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:38,319
so some of the open issues which we have

1508
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:40,238
right now is like uh

1509
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:41,960
do we want to move

1510
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:45,920
rfcs1112 with igmp

1511
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,158
v1 and mldv1 to historic so this is also

1512
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:52,399
one of the questions which will be asked

1513
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:54,960
in the last atf as well

1514
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:55,759
and

1515
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:59,198
second thing is like rfc four zero

1516
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:02,399
four six zero four uh ssm

1517
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:05,520
for igmp and mlt so do

1518
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,600
uh do we want to incorporate that in the

1519
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,920
uh this while this while we are moving

1520
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,080
with the advancement of

1521
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,679
this internet standard so we want to

1522
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:18,839
incorporate 4604 and that

1523
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:22,479
and another question is like uh

1524
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:25,040
how we want to define the relationship

1525
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,880
with the new pim igmp mld extension of

1526
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,839
this piece this drops

1527
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:36,158
and i guess last one is the errada 675

1528
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:38,560
which is recently being filed

1529
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,759
and i brian i think he's already

1530
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,799
working on it so i there there is some

1531
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:47,040
email communication happening over the

1532
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,279
working group as well

1533
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:53,839
so these are the current open issues

1534
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,000
uh

1535
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
yeah i have a couple of comments on that

1536
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,040
so

1537
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,480
for the uh

1538
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,120
igmpmld extension

1539
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,120
at least after pulling the working group

1540
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,040
you know i think there's agreement that

1541
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,320
we don't need to um

1542
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,800
make it an official update of the of the

1543
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,440
igp mlb rfcs

1544
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:24,080
so i don't think it should be an issue

1545
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,040
for um

1546
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,880
to make the right decision on the first

1547
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,360
two i think you know we need to have

1548
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,360
more details i think and it's probably

1549
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,320
good to

1550
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,159
send some emails to the working group

1551
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:38,960
mailing list and basically

1552
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,520
outline a bit more what uh what

1553
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,920
you should consider

1554
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:47,120
like for instance for 4604 like what is

1555
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,280
the actual text that

1556
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,040
what's the scope of

1557
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,640
the work you know what text do we want

1558
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,080
to actually

1559
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,480
copy from 4604

1560
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,800
um

1561
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,800
so yeah

1562
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,480
it's kind of hard to

1563
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,080
without having all those details and

1564
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,159
maybe doing some thinking to to answer

1565
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:08,159
these questions right so

1566
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:09,840
getting some discussion on the list of

1567
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,840
big rates

1568
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,239
guess for second one uh while in the

1569
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:18,800
internal meeting we do identified uh so

1570
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,960
what sections we would be borrowing from

1571
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,640
4604

1572
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,040
uh i think yeah it would be better if we

1573
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:28,800
put all those things in email and

1574
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,000
get along on the group

1575
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,960
okay great

1576
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,560
and regarding the

1577
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,480
first one are so uh

1578
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:45,760
uh

1579
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,440
is it like

1580
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,040
we should be asking this thing over the

1581
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,400
group or

1582
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,800
moving the rfcs to

1583
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,960
the older one started

1584
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,800
all right i think it would be good to

1585
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,280
send an email to the

1586
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,640
to the mailing list for this one as well

1587
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:03,679
so maybe

1588
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:07,840
send you know separate emails for each

1589
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,800
bullet points kind of

1590
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,760
try to get input

1591
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,280
i guess so

1592
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,000
this is the pretty much update any

1593
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,159
questions or

1594
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,360
