remember we're

27
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,600
participating in personally that means

no personal attacks and such

29
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,880
and remember that we're here to devise

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,640
solutions that work in the global

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,360
internet which

32
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,960
means that we need to consider the

33
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,799
diversity and the operational

34
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,439
environments

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,040
that are

36
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,240
available

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,920
and

38
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,720
not just one one way that one person

39
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,479
uses the internet

40
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,840
and

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,640
also be prepared to contribute in the

42
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,560
ongoing discussions

43
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,920
so thank you next slide

44
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,360
so we just took care of note takers and

45
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,680
jabber room watcher thank you very much

46
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,400
the blue sheets will be automatically

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,680
created

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,879
by you logging into the medico session

49
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,518
next slide

50
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,080
so

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,280
this is the agenda

52
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,239
or at least the first slide of the

53
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,840
agenda

54
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,599
um

55
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,680
put the second one up and then ask are

56
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,879
there any um

57
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,920
bashes we just heard from brendan that

58
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,400
his time went to the documents on the

59
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,760
first slide

60
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,599
so we're basically

61
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,319
uh have very little to say on items five

62
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,799
and six

63
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,239
okay let's go back to the previous slide

64
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,040
yeah the trust domains and yeah

65
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,280
right

66
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,560
basically uh that's correct the uh

67
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
earlier item got

68
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,480
divided up

69
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,400
uh into multiple documents and we'll

70
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,920
talk about why

71
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,480
um but let's talk about the status of

72
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,720
the working group recharter

73
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,840
uh we had a long pause uh

74
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,440
sorry the chairs

75
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,599
probably should have nudged that sooner

76
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,680
after

77
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,000
coming to some text

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,560
then we put together some milestones and

79
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,780
sent those to roman roman has in turn

80
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,360
[Music]

81
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,879
updated that to the data tracker and

82
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,120
had some minor discussions about some

83
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,799
word changes

84
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,519
go ahead roman

85
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,120
hi everyone uh yeah i just wanted to

86
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,959
check it i think we are

87
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,839
quite uh quite at the cusp of being done

88
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,959
here uh thanks for kind of the the new

89
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,199
milestones everything's dropped in my

90
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,800
only remaining question before i would

91
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,720
hit the send button is what about a

92
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,800
milestone on the order of what i just

93
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,440
put in chat which says let's put a

94
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,320
marker for when we coordinate with rats

95
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,440
on where the document goes i feel like

96
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,280
given the dynamic in the group it would

97
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,880
be helpful if

98
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,560
we put a pin in it to make sure it

99
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,639
doesn't get away from us

100
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,400
well i i

101
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,560
think i said in email i don't think

102
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,400
that's going to get away with us

103
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,320
in the sense that right now it looks

104
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,120
like

105
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,000
uh rats is going to drive that document

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,400
and so as long as we coordinate with

107
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,600
them

108
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,400
we should leave the milestone to them

109
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,880
was my thought

110
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,160
dave

111
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,880
do you have any thoughts

112
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,680
we got two daves so i don't know which

113
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
ones

114
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,880
either one who has a view

115
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,759
uh i i'm okay either way i think this is

116
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,840
what's on here right now that uh roman

117
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,120
was referring to you can see this bill

118
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,160
is from uh next month uh out for one

119
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,520
year with other things there so i just

120
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,639
wanted to call that up on the screen

121
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,560
there um and i think roman you're

122
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,440
proposing that we have one that is uh a

123
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,720
milestone for deciding um where things

124
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,800
go is that did i get that right

125
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,720
yeah that's exactly right because i

126
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,520
guess my point is if it's undecided we

127
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,600
should have a milestone if it's actually

128
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,680
going to rats then we should probably

129
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,759
update the core charter text which seems

130
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,240
to suggest that it's ambiguous

131
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,160
right you know i i agree it just it

132
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,520
looks like it's going to rats right now

133
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
but the final decision i don't think has

134
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,639
been made

135
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,880
um

136
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,720
so shall we say by march

137
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,000
what what's what do folks think is

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,400
reasonable

139
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,840
um

140
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,840
maybe uh

141
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,960
i know there's a couple other rats

142
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,520
people on here between uh michael and

143
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,960
folks but if

144
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,479
there's any objections to that speak up

145
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,319
what actions do we need to take in order

146
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,039
to

147
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,919
make this decision

148
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,360
well

149
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,240
last ietf we had a discussion about a

150
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,880
particular document and we said where

151
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,560
should that go and we had a discussion

152
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,800
in both suit and in

153
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,120
rats about where that should go

154
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,280
and uh as at the end of last iatf the

155
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,360
um there were two parts of the

156
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,120
discussion one was some general stuff

157
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,800
and one that were suit specific claims

158
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
and the real discussion we're having

159
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,759
here is about the suit specific claims

160
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,080
okay and so our suit specific claims is

161
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,479
that's the the rat's profile for suit

162
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,400
does that go in this in the uh rats

163
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,080
working group with a cert working group

164
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,160
that's the decision we're talking about

165
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,479
right

166
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,440
hank go ahead

167
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,000
so so he either from my management uh

168
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,759
chaos

169
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,560
is to do that in rats of course but

170
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,120
if there is a feasible reason

171
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,800
um that we can we should split it

172
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,080
i'm i'm willing to listen um but but for

173
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,560
for my personal convenience i think

174
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,319
keeping it in one place would be nice if

175
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,960
that rats are not not against that no i

176
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,919
i think that the rats is the right home

177
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,840
personally uh that's just my thoughts um

178
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,919
and could be convinced otherwise but

179
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,440
that we want to make sure this group

180
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,759
reviews it i think is where we're

181
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,280
landing uh michael

182
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,720
so i'm just concerned that

183
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
we think we feel like we had a

184
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,520
conversation last time and

185
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,960
um

186
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,639
like that what we actually just need to

187
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,160
have is a a 20-minute virtual interim

188
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,800
um between now and march

189
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,240
uh probably before christmas where we

190
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,560
just make sure that all the people are

191
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,159
doing and have a longer conversation

192
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,839
like actually

193
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,080
and michael you're suggesting a combined

194
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,679
meeting between

195
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,399
rats and suit to discuss this draft

196
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,880
yeah i mean it doesn't have to you know

197
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,480
it doesn't have to be three hours long

198
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,320
right just sure has to happen right

199
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,399
good suggestion um we'll coordinate with

200
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,959
the rats chairs and figure out how to

201
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,640
make that happen

202
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,839
i see brandon's also in queue

203
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,200
brendan

204
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,560
this seems to me like a bit of a

205
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,480
bellwether for what rats is going to

206
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
look like going forwards

207
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,080
does rats want to deal with every single

208
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,880
other

209
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,440
thing specific set of claims or does

210
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,720
rats want that to land in the individual

211
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,839
working groups this ultimately as near

212
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,120
as i can tell

213
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,279
is more of an iana decision than

214
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,279
anything else we have to register claim

215
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,080
sets so i'm a little bit confused as to

216
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,760
why we're having this discussion at all

217
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,720
i thought it was reasonably clear that

218
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,240
rats set up the base uh you know

219
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,160
draft and the rest of its iana

220
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,920
registrations i don't understand what

221
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,680
we're doing here

222
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,120
uh there's a

223
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,360
suit profile and a individual submission

224
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,959
right now that's a candidate for that

225
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,800
type of work um is a draft burkholz suit

226
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,880
claims and the suit clean the suit

227
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,279
specific stuff is basically

228
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,240
section 3.2 is an example of something

229
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,480
that could be used to meet this

230
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,920
given that this is individual summation

231
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,680
we can't say this is ietf and stuff but

232
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,720
we're talking about the part that's

233
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
highlighted here on the screen is a

234
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,040
candidate for that and the question is

235
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,200
whether this type of information would

236
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
be in suit or unrest answer your

237
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,600
question brendan when the rats working

238
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,440
group was first chartered there was this

239
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,160
discussion and an analogy was given to

240
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,040
things like how the dhcp or jc working

241
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,600
group works where they form the base but

242
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,279
profiles are done on other working

243
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,160
groups with uh dhc being the reviewer of

244
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,839
them but they don't do all the options

245
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,680
right and so rats could be the same

246
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,040
thing and that's the argument for why

247
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,720
this might be done in the seat working

248
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,640
group and why there would be a charter

249
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,240
milestone that's at least a placeholder

250
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,480
for the decision if not the actual work

251
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,360
as to whether a suit profile and it's uh

252
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,880
any claims specific to the use of suit

253
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,720
and the applicability and security

254
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,480
considerations around them would be in a

255
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,720
document right and so this is an example

256
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,160
of a document just for everybody else

257
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,760
here a lot of people have looked at this

258
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,040
but if you haven't

259
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,279
then this is a placeholder for uh

260
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,760
something that could meet that work

261
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,680
and in this example you can see its use

262
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,800
of say uh suit records is one type of

263
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,279
thing that could be in claims there

264
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,600
could be claims about suit records and

265
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,200
not the suit records themselves but the

266
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,720
point is that's the actual work that

267
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,320
we're not trying to have here the

268
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
question is which charter does it belong

269
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,640
in and to your point brenda there's a

270
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,399
valid argument that says that it could

271
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,959
belong in suit with rat's review okay

272
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,399
and so that's the discussion so

273
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,439
yeah there are i have to admit there are

274
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,200
less a small

275
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,079
amount but but then very universal

276
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,040
claims here and i think just sorting

277
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,079
that out

278
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,360
is the problem here it's not it's not

279
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,920
about the registry it's not about the uh

280
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,320
actual um maybe not even about the

281
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,560
actual working group but it's it's about

282
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,639
understanding what these claims claims

283
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,440
mean

284
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,680
and and and what scope they have and and

285
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,320
then i think the rest is just as easy

286
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,639
easy

287
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,560
yeah there was a discussion for those

288
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,639
who were in the uh rats working group

289
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,320
earlier i raised this at the mic because

290
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,079
there's some of the parts of this top

291
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:24,959
part

292
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,760
in a hank's document that has now been

293
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,920
obsoleted by recent additions to the eat

294
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,320
document and so an example that i called

295
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,440
out in the meeting is this one right

296
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,760
here there's now a this is pulled into

297
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,000
the document itself other things that

298
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,880
are in here are things that um

299
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,279
might be in rats because they're generic

300
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,120
not specific to suit and then other ones

301
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
are specific to suit and so the point is

302
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,639
this document right here has a mix of

303
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,720
some things that are suite-specific and

304
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,040
some that are not and it could be that

305
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,040
the non-suit specific ones go into rats

306
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,519
and suit specific ones go into suit uh

307
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,639
but that's kind of the ongoing

308
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,279
discussion so

309
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,519
and it sounds like that might be the

310
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,360
topic of discussion if we have this

311
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,839
interim

312
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,760
um

313
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,880
although i think

314
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,720
the the the topic of the interim was

315
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,800
about specifically about the suit

316
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,959
specific things because my hope is that

317
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,480
the non-suit specific stuff could be

318
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,240
worked out long before an interim if not

319
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,680
uh some of those would be worked out by

320
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,040
friday based on the rest meeting

321
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,360
discussion um of this week meaning by

322
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,880
the end of the ietf week here but the

323
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,560
suit specific ones i think having an

324
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,880
interim would be uh

325
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
helpful for because regardless of which

326
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,560
one it's in we want review from both

327
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,320
groups and having that be a topic even

328
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
if it's a short interim meeting that

329
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,760
would be very useful so i agree with

330
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,600
that suggestion as a

331
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,160
is there any chance to get the um the

332
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,000
philosophical discussion about where

333
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,760
these extensions should be worked is

334
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,440
there any chance that that will get

335
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,959
resolved in the rats

336
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,519
meeting later this week

337
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,040
no

338
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,279
i don't think so well that's my opinion

339
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,959
than all those other rats people on here

340
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,800
but that's because here the question is

341
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,880
about the suit profile

342
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,680
my belief is is this my personal belief

343
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,120
is aligned with i think what brennan

344
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,279
said which is the rats

345
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,959
working group would probably prefer that

346
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,639
profiles be done in the working group

347
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,320
the profile is for in other words they

348
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,600
would probably kick the suit specific

349
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,360
stuff over a suit but that's me trying

350
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,680
to predict what they would say

351
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,120
okay

352
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,639
yeah and then there's a question of

353
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,680
timing

354
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,639
and i think the session is really full

355
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,800
yeah so it sounds like some coordination

356
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,680
is going to be necessary to move forward

357
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
yeah but i think to answer roman's

358
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,680
question my opinion is yes i think it's

359
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
fine to put in a milestone that says

360
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,800
make a decision by march

361
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,959
with the wording that roman posted in

362
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,480
chat

363
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,720
uh awesome so i will put that in as a

364
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,360
milestone and then i will submit it for

365
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,000
the isg for for kind of for initial

366
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,560
review so we can keep things moving

367
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,839
thanks for everyone's help here

368
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,800
thanks robin

369
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,839
finished the uh working group recharter

370
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:16,959
summary

371
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,480
um

372
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,000
i don't we don't have slides for the

373
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,680
hackathon but is there somebody who

374
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,600
wants to say something about that how

375
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,839
that went and what we learned

376
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,360
uh hi uh this is honest again um

377
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
yeah we had um

378
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,440
i gave a presentation

379
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,240
at the end of the hackathon week which

380
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,399
can be looked up and i will share the

381
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,800
link in the chat window don't have that

382
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,399
ready don't want to go through that

383
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,360
slide deck but in a nutshell we had a

384
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,000
number of folks showing up we uh

385
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,440
emmanuel

386
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,800
organized

387
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,040
several presentations which uh

388
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,320
um

389
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,160
look at the identity list but uh some of

390
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,440
you attended

391
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,959
uh for sure

392
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,959
those were good presentations um they

393
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,759
have been recorded per request

394
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,920
so they are up there but also share the

395
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,800
link slides are available

396
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,519
the purpose of the presentations

397
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,600
was to give people a

398
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,079
quick introduction into

399
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,839
some of the tools and the code

400
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:21,839
um uh

401
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,560
on riot and the extensions uh made for

402
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,079
suit and uh

403
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,639
point us to uh the code that brenton had

404
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,120
been working on et cetera et cetera

405
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,920
uh so that was that was pretty good um

406
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,040
we had some

407
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,959
hacking events as well on different

408
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,040
fronts so it was a little kept all over

409
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,279
the place with regards to activities um

410
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,759
the links to the code are also in the

411
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,199
slide deck

412
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,320
um

413
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,040
i still owe a couple of folks hardware

414
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
unfortunately that

415
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,920
the ordering process was a little bit

416
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
difficult

417
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,800
so

418
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,040
hold your breath and uh will will work

419
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,560
out in the end

420
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,010
um

421
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,079
[Music]

422
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,720
i also noticed uh and i think that's the

423
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,559
lesson learned is like

424
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
it's uh

425
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,720
getting

426
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,319
diff or more and more difficult for

427
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,240
people to really

428
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,720
sort of do these hackathons uh or in

429
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,640
general these online events because

430
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,559
there's so many concurrent activities

431
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,839
going on

432
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,640
so you have to be extremely

433
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,160
um

434
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,480
disciplined to actually follow things

435
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,439
through

436
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,520
and but i'm still hoping

437
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,960
either that we

438
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,200
switch over to face-to-face uh

439
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,960
hackathons again

440
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,320
um or

441
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,440
that we

442
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,640
um sort of sort of become very creative

443
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
in organizing those uh

444
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,480
given the time zone differences and all

445
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,080
the other problems so yeah

446
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,440
but in if any one of you has uh interest

447
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,840
to look at the code and or have some

448
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,559
questions on on the presentations or

449
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,160
anything else um

450
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,799
just drop me an email or or emmanuel in

451
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,840
this case as well he since he has been

452
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,080
helping to organize uh the this

453
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,760
hackathon event um on suit and deep and

454
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,200
etc

455
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,720
um

456
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,360
i i'm i'm sure we can help

457
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,120
hey honestly could you provide a link to

458
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,960
the slides

459
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,960
yes um uh give me a second to look it up

460
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,200
sure thanks

461
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,720
okay were you ready to move on to the

462
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,880
next presentation

463
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,440
seeing any questions so let's go to uh

464
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,919
brandon

465
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,640
uh hi so um i guess next slide please

466
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,080
uh you're also invited to turn on your

467
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,240
camera if you like oh yeah i can do that

468
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
can't i

469
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,799
i have terrible wi-fi at my house so

470
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,880
this is a uh a strange uh and and new

471
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,200
experience that i can actually use video

472
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,000
again

473
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,360
um okay

474
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,280
so uh

475
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,280
the key changes uh for for suit manifest

476
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,400
16 are essentially what we discussed

477
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,200
last time

478
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,440
in ietf 111 the the most important thing

479
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,679
that's changed is that

480
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,880
we have broken the manifest document

481
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,280
apart into

482
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,240
four or theoretically five different

483
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,360
drafts

484
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,160
uh the fifth draft i'll mention briefly

485
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,720
later on what it would be if it existed

486
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,530
but it doesn't exist

487
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,840
[Music]

488
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,760
so that's that's the primary bit of the

489
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,559
work

490
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,559
uh there's also uh two minor changes

491
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,080
that were added in

492
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,679
uh the

493
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,760
integrated element keys so that would

494
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,320
apply to integrated payloads and

495
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,799
integrated dependencies those are both

496
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,200
uh have minor changes i'll get to that

497
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,559
in a minute

498
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,760
and then there's the uri definition

499
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,520
and that's had a minor change as well

500
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,240
next slide please

501
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,559
so uh what is covered in the core

502
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,080
document now

503
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,039
is

504
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,039
the authentication

505
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,360
basic flow control so the try each and

506
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,400
multiple components mechanisms

507
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,559
parameter setting but only override

508
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,559
parameters and the reason for that is

509
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,720
that set parameters should not be

510
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,280
necessary unless you have

511
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,760
multiple manifests and this doesn't

512
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,480
cover multiple manifests

513
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,799
severable members so that's the elements

514
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,120
being taken out of the manifest and

515
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,880
placed in the

516
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,400
manifest envelope

517
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,280
and finally the text description those

518
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,520
are essentially what's covered by the

519
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,960
current

520
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,640
core specification

521
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,440
next slide please

522
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,440
well you can see here that we made an

523
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,320
effort to ensure that

524
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
the core specification is simple because

525
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,520
here's the list of what's not covered

526
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
we don't have delegation so that will

527
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,080
mean that any form of key delegation has

528
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,360
to happen

529
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,799
out of band

530
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,600
or using the uh

531
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,159
the trust domain specification

532
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,919
similarly dependency manifests are

533
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,159
covered in trust domains and multiple

534
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,760
suit processors are covered in trust

535
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,039
domains

536
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,360
the uh

537
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,200
the multiple suit processors just as a

538
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,600
reminder oh no that that'll come up in a

539
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,039
later presentation i'll leave that for

540
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,120
now uh payload transforms are the one

541
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,840
thing that doesn't have a uh

542
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,400
a dedicated document we do have one for

543
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,120
encrypted firmware but we don't have one

544
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,320
for any form of compression

545
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,760
um

546
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,640
we do

547
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,000
the the conditions for managing updates

548
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,960
and directives and metadata for managing

549
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,120
updates are

550
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,440
in the separate update management

551
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,880
specification

552
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,120
or individual draft i mean

553
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,039
so that's uh that those are up and

554
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,799
coming but they are not covered in the

555
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,280
core specification anymore so those

556
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,960
things are

557
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,520
no longer right in the core which will

558
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,200
hopefully simplify it substantially

559
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,320
next slide please

560
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,760
uh the integrated element keys so i

561
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,919
mentioned i alluded to this earlier but

562
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,720
the the idea here was that

563
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,919
the

564
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,840
original specification had a somewhat

565
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,000
cumbersome mechanism for referring to

566
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,159
integrated elements so if you had an

567
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,159
integrated payload you had to use a

568
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,640
fragment only reference uri and that

569
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,360
fragment only reference

570
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,679
had to be a number and that number had

571
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,840
to convert to a specific range of

572
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,120
integer

573
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,559
and that

574
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,039
on doing it that on uh constrained

575
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,320
devices seemed uh like it was more

576
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,520
cumbersome than necessary so this change

577
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,320
says that instead uh

578
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,400
of doing that it will be direct uh text

579
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,320
string matching so you have a text

580
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,720
string key for your integrated element

581
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,120
which guarantees that it won't collide

582
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,320
with

583
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,799
any future extensions

584
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,480
and that text string

585
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,520
uh

586
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,760
will be identical to the text string

587
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,919
reference that's placed in the uri field

588
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,279
so the

589
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,960
the one additional thing that this

590
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,559
enables which is

591
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,559
hopefully useful

592
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,640
is that a

593
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,320
an intermediary can pre-fetch a payload

594
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,520
and embed it in the manifest envelope

595
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,559
and

596
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,279
then as long as a

597
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:08,159
device knows to start by checking the

598
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,960
the manifest envelope for the

599
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,159
appropriate text string and then perform

600
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,960
a remote fetch then uh precaching can be

601
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,799
done in a relatively straightforward way

602
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,600
next slide please

603
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,360
this is a simple change previously the

604
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,080
manifest specification referred to uris

605
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,360
now it

606
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,120
makes it explicit that that's a uri

607
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,440
reference and it's not strictly

608
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,520
necessary to have the

609
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,240
fully qualified domain name etc

610
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,039
next slide please

611
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,400
so we have a few open issues

612
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,080
at ietf 111 we discussed the uh need for

613
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,360
more

614
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,880
more information on implementation

615
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,080
overhead for hierarchical

616
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,400
hash based signatures

617
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,080
one of the pieces of information was

618
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,200
verification time and thanks to the work

619
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,600
done by emmanuel's group we know that

620
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,840
the verification time is roughly on the

621
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,320
order of one third of an ecdsi

622
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,960
verification and it's

623
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,919
slightly longer than an ed dsa

624
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,200
verification

625
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,159
and

626
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,400
we don't really know why this is yet as

627
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,880
far as i know but i would

628
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,760
one of the possibilities is that

629
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
libraries are frequently optimized for

630
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
performing one long hash rather than

631
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,360
many small hashes

632
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,799
so it remains to be seen what happens if

633
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,159
we

634
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,440
have more optimized digest libraries

635
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,480
that are

636
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,440
targeted specifically at hss lms and can

637
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,760
handle doing lots of small digests

638
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,080
so just as a summary the choice for a

639
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,520
mandatory to implement signature

640
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,799
algorithm appears to be between ecdsa

641
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,559
and hss lms

642
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,279
uh the pro the single biggest problem

643
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,360
with ecdsa is that it's not quantum

644
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,480
resistant

645
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,840
the uh benefits it has are mature or

646
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,279
well primarily the maturity of the

647
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,360
tooling um

648
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,440
the long verification time obviously not

649
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,559
a benefit

650
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,520
um

651
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,360
for hss lms

652
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,360
the uh the biggest detractors it has are

653
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,360
probably that it's got relatively

654
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,799
immature tooling

655
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,960
um it itself is not immature just the

656
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,960
tooling

657
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,080
the

658
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,240
private keys require ongoing maintenance

659
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,000
which which essentially means that after

660
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,760
each signature the private key needs to

661
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,520
be updated

662
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
and there's only a fixed number of

663
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,919
signatures possible and signature sizes

664
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:44,640
are

665
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,799
at least a kilobyte that's

666
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,279
in fact this thing is 1280 bytes

667
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,960
is the bare minimum

668
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,640
so uh

669
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,400
that's essentially the trade-off that we

670
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,880
have to decide on um if we're going to

671
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,799
have only a single mandatory to

672
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,600
implement a signature algorithm

673
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,000
next slide please

674
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,480
um so we need to also discuss what we're

675
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,159
going to do for optional to implement

676
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,720
algorithms um rsa has been requested but

677
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,080
um i think that we should be very

678
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,399
careful about permitting that

679
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,880
given some of the research that's going

680
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,440
on in that area

681
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,720
there's also a question as to whether we

682
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,120
should have

683
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,840
failover options

684
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,240
for digest algorithms uh particularly

685
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,919
where boot loaders are concerned this

686
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,559
becomes a really big question about

687
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,039
whether we can actually afford to have

688
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,120
any crypto agility so i'm looking for

689
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,880
advice or or input or recommendations on

690
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,640
the topic of crypto agility and

691
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,320
constrained devices

692
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,600
um

693
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,200
so that's uh

694
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,480
that's a an open question um if that's

695
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,960
anything that we can

696
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,399
if there's any advice we have there

697
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,799
and i think that is it

698
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,760
is there another slide

699
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,360
i think we want to

700
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,679
open it for a discussion here i guess

701
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,200
russia and q go ahead

702
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,399
so um a good bit of our crypto agility

703
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,559
comes from just using the cose

704
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,080
constructs the registries already exist

705
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
um

706
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,799
but we do need to have mandatory

707
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,039
implements i think the may implements

708
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,720
are anything else that's registered

709
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,360
so my concern with that approach is that

710
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,440
that works really well

711
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,240
in the non-constrained environments

712
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,880
where updates are straightforward

713
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,200
but when we look at

714
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,880
the constrained environment where there

715
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,600
are

716
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,039
certain uh

717
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,279
parts of the

718
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,279
of the device that simply can't be

719
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,440
updated like you know

720
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,600
wrong boot loaders or

721
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,960
um or early stage processes

722
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,240
uh

723
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,320
we really need to be careful about what

724
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,240
gets mandated and i think we've had some

725
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,200
discussions with uh with on the subject

726
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,120
of that with mcu boot in the past as

727
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,240
well

728
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,600
so sure i i agree with all of that but i

729
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,480
think that's a constraint that is

730
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,640
outside the protocol and i don't know

731
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,919
how we what we would put in the protocol

732
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,760
to address that but

733
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,320
dave's in queue go ahead

734
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
well i have a

735
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,600
question and i don't know whether the

736
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,520
question will help or not and it's not a

737
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,760
preference it's actually a question um

738
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,039
because there's a couple things that we

739
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,000
could do

740
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,279
uh but when we're talking about

741
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,720
mandatory to implement let's just go

742
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,320
back a slide because this is the

743
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,720
mandatory to implement question uh on

744
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,840
this one because the ones are talking

745
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,799
about optional implements um so one way

746
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,000
there's a couple different approaches

747
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,080
you can take with doing uh mti because

748
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,840
you have to say it's metroid implement

749
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,000
for whom right because in the

750
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,159
suit there's at least two at least two

751
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,399
roles arguably more right there's the

752
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,279
manifest author and there's the manifest

753
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,720
uh consumer

754
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,919
and maybe there's a manifest

755
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,200
intermediary depending on whether you

756
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,720
count that you count that as opaque is

757
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,480
that is that suit enlightened in any way

758
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,679
whether there's a third role or not

759
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,640
maybe depends okay and so mandatory to

760
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,880
implement for whom right so for some

761
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,919
classes of protocol you say you can say

762
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,760
that the same thing is mandatory to

763
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,480
implement on both ends right um and for

764
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,240
other examples is where you have

765
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,799
multiple possibilities on one end uh

766
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,760
sorry notice pick one on one end and

767
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,760
multiple that are uh collectively

768
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,200
mandatory to implement on the other end

769
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,080
and so

770
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,520
for example and again this is not a

771
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,720
recommendation this is part of the

772
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
question you could say

773
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,880
that both of these are mandatory to

774
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,960
implement on authoring sides and the

775
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,880
consuming side gets to pick one or some

776
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,399
other variation right i'm saying as long

777
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,240
as you can guarantee that that author

778
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,799
and a uh a parser can talk to each other

779
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,240
there's multiple ways to accomplish that

780
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,679
right and so the question the working

781
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:14,880
group is

782
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,360
do we want to pick one for all roles or

783
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,519
do we want to allow different roles to

784
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,519
have different ways of phrasing the

785
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,279
question in other words multiple

786
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,840
possibilities versus multiple required

787
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,760
mandatory implement and so which way do

788
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,120
we want to frame the question is the

789
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,320
question that i have to the working

790
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,559
group so

791
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,679
i bring that up only because of

792
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,440
brennan's last point about constrained

793
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,840
devices right if you said well some

794
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,760
constrained devices could only do you

795
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,000
know ecdsa because they're immediate

796
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,440
they need mature tooling other

797
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,039
constrained devices might only be able

798
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,320
to do the other one because the

799
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,640
verification time is lighter or whatever

800
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,240
is that a blocker to make them be

801
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,080
mandatory to implement on a per use case

802
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,320
basis and say authors have to be capable

803
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,399
of doing either of them there's just

804
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,080
different ways to skin it right which

805
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,760
way do we want to craft the requirement

806
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,399
is the question so

807
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,320
strange implementations i don't know if

808
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,000
uh

809
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,480
like david brown or anybody has a

810
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,519
particular opinion on this one

811
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,159
i suspect that's the way we have to do

812
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,200
it it's that we have to specify that the

813
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,720
author has a list of mandatory to

814
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
implement algorithms

815
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,080
but that the

816
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,199
recipient gets to pick one

817
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,640
walter mark go ahead david brown

818
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,279
the comment i would make is probably the

819
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,679
same as it was at 111

820
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,440
that

821
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,000
it i just fear that picking something is

822
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,840
mandatory to implement is going to mean

823
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,679
we're going to end up with a lot of

824
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,320
non-compliant implementations

825
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,720
and the way mcu boot works is you pick

826
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,840
at compile time what implementations you

827
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,200
have available

828
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,799
in a given build

829
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:11,600
and

830
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,120
there's a lot of really resource

831
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,559
constraint like where we try to get the

832
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,120
bootloader to fit into 16 kilobytes and

833
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,559
it's going to be pretty hard to pick

834
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,320
more than one algorithm

835
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,720
and if the one somebody wants isn't one

836
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,840
that we've picked as mandatory

837
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,120
it's

838
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,240
i mean they're not going to be able to

839
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,600
pick the other one so i don't know what

840
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,559
that means as far as compliance or

841
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,480
you know what what we're trying to say

842
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,120
by saying it's mandatory

843
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,960
i

844
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,519
i think that the idea here is that we

845
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,000
we're trying to set the target for

846
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,679
interoperability i mean it seems like on

847
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,440
you know david based on your your

848
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,960
comment that we're either going to end

849
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,159
up with

850
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,840
non-compliant solutions or

851
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,039
non-interoperable solutions or both um

852
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,880
you know based on some of the resource

853
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,760
constraints i think what we're trying to

854
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,919
accomplish through this is at least

855
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,440
trying to define a baseline for

856
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,119
interoperability which i think is the

857
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,079
best that we can do

858
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,879
okay mike

859
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,440
um

860
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,560
so

861
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,159
i could see david's point with me

862
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,480
because he's building a library which is

863
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,599
linked

864
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,399
and uh probably to a defender who's

865
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,839
indicated in a

866
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,960
street bomb

867
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,679
uh assuming this was the manufacturer

868
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,679
uh not uh someone who operates the

869
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,800
network um

870
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,760
they're gonna put the algorithm

871
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,719
that trust anchors into the right for

872
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,440
because you can also keep it

873
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,160
so

874
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,079
you can argue a lot about what is the

875
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,280
mandatory to implement from uh

876
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,200
what we would like to see out there what

877
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,359
we'd like to recommend

878
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,920
but uh trust banker is not there then it

879
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,440
doesn't matter

880
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,640
and that

881
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,839
that's within the ability of the

882
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:16,480
organization who built the device to

883
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,599
defy

884
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,760
uh and coordinate without our health our

885
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,640
health

886
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,040
so i think strongly that we should say

887
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,240
um

888
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,040
uh pathway signatures should be the

889
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,800
mandatory implement in our document um

890
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,400
and there where

891
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,160
very well may be

892
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
non-compliant implementations out there

893
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,280
for a while

894
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,079
and that uh perhaps what will push this

895
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,960
you know commit for tooling forward um

896
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,480
and i don't see another way and i don't

897
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,760
really see any i don't think you're

898
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,400
doing any other

899
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,760
buddy was not great but i think i

900
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,200
understood your main point to be an

901
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,599
argument that if that we should make hss

902
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,359
lms be the mandatory one i think that

903
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,200
was the bottom line after uh some

904
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,280
rationale in there if i got that wrong

905
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,720
please post in the chat um akira

906
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,400
yeah i just it's uh

907
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,280
for the

908
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,839
mandatory or requirement anything goes

909
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,640
into suit it's going to be mandatory

910
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
automatically for the tip

911
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,839
and if it is going to have any

912
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,839
mandatory uh required um algorithm it's

913
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,640
it's automatically going to be

914
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,680
in the requirement for the tip so uh

915
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,480
i prefer

916
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,200
uh suit keep eat not selecting um

917
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,119
different mandatory

918
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,000
uh

919
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
orgasm yeah that that's all

920
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,320
i guess i have one question one question

921
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,839
we we had a discussion previously about

922
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,079
how we specify

923
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,359
um capability reporting and

924
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,000
i forgive me i don't actually recall no

925
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,599
i have not submitted a draft on

926
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,760
capability reporting um but that is

927
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,800
something that i think we should

928
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,920
probably do

929
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,359
um

930
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,440
does this

931
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,960
discussion of mandatory to implement um

932
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,920
become irrelevant if we specify

933
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,599
a capability reporting system

934
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,680
can we just get away from worrying about

935
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,160
it at all

936
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,720
so it's an interesting question because

937
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,800
you know you're specifying a manifest to

938
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,640
do something right and the thing that

939
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,480
you're going to do like install code and

940
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,320
you can't have code that's going to work

941
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,079
on arbitrary numbers of things right so

942
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,680
your suit manifest is actually crafted

943
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,320
for a particular class of system right

944
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,760
and so you got to have that knowledge or

945
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,960
you couldn't have crafted that in other

946
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,160
words at least has to be internally

947
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,160
consistent right if the type of system

948
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,680
that could run the binary that you're

949
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,920
referencing is the one that has the

950
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,599
algorithm that you know of and you and

951
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,440
you can uh and as the author you can

952
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,800
correlate that information then you're

953
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,240
crafting an internally consistent suit

954
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,480
manifest and so whether it becomes

955
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,240
irrelevant i don't know i think the real

956
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,079
requirement is that you can craft a suit

957
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,760
manifest it's consistent with the type

958
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,520
of entity that could actually run the

959
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,640
thing being expressed by the suit

960
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,920
manifest

961
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,560
yeah and from following on from that

962
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,599
argument i i simply i have to ask

963
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,000
do we need to tie down the signature

964
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,839
algorithm with a mandatory to implement

965
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:30,800
one or is it adequate for a certain

966
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,440
for there to be consistent pairs of

967
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,160
author and consumer

968
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,000
okay so while i'm at the mic let me just

969
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,520
finish what i was going to say and then

970
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,160
i'll pass it to david brown um i think

971
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,599
the the only

972
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,000
case that i can think of where my

973
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,480
previous statement doesn't hold is if

974
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,359
you do have say an intermediary that

975
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,119
does things with suit manifest without

976
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,240
being able to

977
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,240
without being able to do the the binary

978
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,839
itself right it's just the forwarder but

979
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,839
it may do things like oh i do the

980
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,000
counter signing for them that type of

981
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,119
thing and if i need to be able to

982
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,040
counter sign i don't care whether i

983
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,400
interpret the binary i have to be able

984
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,079
to interpret this manifest and that's

985
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,000
where i think the mti stuff may actually

986
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,720
apply and so david you're up next

987
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,480
yes i was actually going to

988
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,079
make something kind of a similar point

989
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,400
to what you just said

990
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,560
we have a some consist

991
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,880
configurations we're considering where

992
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,680
the

993
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,160
device that is being updated may not be

994
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,520
network connected

995
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,440
and there is a you might call it a

996
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,760
helper device an intermediary it may be

997
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,240
something on us the same board that's a

998
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,160
more powerful processor

999
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,040
that

1000
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,400
it needs to be able to take this

1001
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
firmware blob in this manifest and kind

1002
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,480
of pass it through and it would be nice

1003
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,119
if it was able to verify the signature

1004
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,960
and you know not

1005
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,839
do operations that are unnecessary

1006
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,520
does that mean now do we just have three

1007
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,800
parties and we need to make sure they

1008
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
all agree on what algorithm

1009
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,200
is done there that you know when it

1010
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,960
really comes down to it

1011
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,640
it is up to just the parties

1012
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,480
participating

1013
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,400
the people making the firmware and the

1014
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,440
device

1015
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,000
needing to agree on this

1016
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,520
and i mean that's practically that's how

1017
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,359
we're doing it now you when you build

1018
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,359
mcu boot you pick the signature

1019
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,280
algorithm that's used and you better

1020
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,280
sign it with that same one or it's not

1021
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,520
valid

1022
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,400
so as far as mti i'm not sure i see the

1023
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,920
benefit

1024
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,920
so i just want to just as chair i want

1025
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,079
to understand what we're actually saying

1026
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,480
here so i think i think what's being

1027
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,079
said is that there

1028
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,760
there are multiple parties that may be

1029
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,400
working together in an ecosystem

1030
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,319
and i think what we're suggesting is

1031
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:41,520
that the

1032
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,839
signature algorithm or algorithms that

1033
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,560
get implemented within a given ecosystem

1034
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,560
will effectively be sorted out by those

1035
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,720
parties and because of that we don't

1036
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,520
need an mti is that is that what's being

1037
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,680
said

1038
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,280
i think so

1039
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,200
cr michael saying you strongly agree

1040
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,400
with me and so i'm going to try to say

1041
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
what i was going to say and hoping that

1042
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,480
this is what he strongly agreed with

1043
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,400
i think what i was concluding is that

1044
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,760
because you can have these uh the middle

1045
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,760
entities such as a cosigner type of a

1046
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,760
role right which is not you know the

1047
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,280
destination that's not running the suit

1048
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,119
manifest but i may have to parse the

1049
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,760
suit manifest construct uh one that

1050
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,599
references it or construct a derivative

1051
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,839
that replaces it whatever it is right

1052
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,240
and so for that i think having mti is

1053
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,160
important so i guess my

1054
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,400
straw man from what i've heard so far

1055
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,079
not strong is that

1056
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,319
constrained devices can pick either

1057
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,520
ecdsa or hss lms but must pick one of

1058
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,960
those two um to be to claim compliance

1059
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,520
and that um authors and cosigners and

1060
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,160
things must implement uh both so both

1061
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,839
the branditory implement on the other

1062
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,400
roles that's kind of where i'm arguing

1063
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,599
and i think that's what would give

1064
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,680
interoperability for scenarios like

1065
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,960
co-signing

1066
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,880
and so on and you know referencing

1067
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,200
dependency manifests and so on but still

1068
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
leave the freedom to constrain devices

1069
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,880
to pick the most appropriate one within

1070
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,040
the set of mtis so i guess that would be

1071
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,640
my proposal on the table right now from

1072
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,440
what i've heard so far

1073
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,079
dave just a clarifying question you know

1074
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,640
what if what if authors are

1075
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,640
writing manifests for a specific set of

1076
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,520
devices where they know

1077
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,760
you know the signature method that's

1078
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,079
being used um

1079
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,760
would they have to support both in that

1080
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,359
case

1081
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,160
you're asking me my proposal and so um i

1082
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,640
will answer my opinion um what the rest

1083
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,920
of the working group says i can't say

1084
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,720
but my opinion is if you're a manifest

1085
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,400
author that's authoring something for a

1086
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,760
particular device you might think you

1087
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,200
know what that device has okay but

1088
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,200
if the actual device is not going to

1089
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,280
process your manifest the actual one is

1090
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,319
going to process because you may not

1091
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:49,520
know the actual device you're doing it

1092
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,280
for a class of devices the actual device

1093
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,359
might do one that's done by a counter

1094
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:54,880
signer instead right you're the

1095
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,400
manufacturer of the software or

1096
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,240
something so you construct one but the

1097
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,520
administrator of the device says i'm

1098
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,880
actually going to parse that myself and

1099
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,079
i'm going to replace it with my own

1100
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,200
that's the counter sign because i've got

1101
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,240
the signature he's actually going to

1102
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,400
trust right and so the only entity that

1103
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,760
parses it might not actually be the

1104
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,839
device and so that's my argument for why

1105
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,760
mtis are important even if you think you

1106
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,680
know the device so

1107
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,280
but i see michael is in queue so maybe

1108
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,079
you have a better idea

1109
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,400
i'm just going to say that you i hope my

1110
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,839
audio is better

1111
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:22,800
my

1112
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,400
that i think you captured what i was

1113
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,520
strongly agreeing with um but

1114
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,160
the the the

1115
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,200
the subset issue is that the author

1116
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,640
knows what uh the manufacturing author

1117
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,240
knows what's available they're not going

1118
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,800
to go outside of that list period okay

1119
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,400
it's not even about guessing they

1120
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,920
constructed the device to know what's

1121
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,400
available period now what your point is

1122
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,319
dave and i agree with strongly but that

1123
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,680
might not be the trust bank of the

1124
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,520
device is going to trust

1125
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,680
because it might be an operator

1126
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,319
thing the operator has to pick a trust

1127
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:59,119
banker or has an algorithm that the

1128
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,359
device can support

1129
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,640
um

1130
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,800
finally i would say that i'm not sure i

1131
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,760
would say eastbay and a test and and

1132
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,200
hash based signatures it's too hard to

1133
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,560
pronounce but

1134
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,599
um are a must i actually would say east

1135
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,400
pds day is a should and the case where

1136
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,760
you shouldn't use it is when it's been

1137
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,599
defeated or you don't have code space

1138
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,240
for it right

1139
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,160
must ec dsa as i should and the other

1140
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,759
ones on the next slide were maze

1141
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,200
i think we're

1142
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,720
on on that topic though i think we're

1143
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,560
rehashing a little bit about about what

1144
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,920
we talked about on in at iatf 111 you

1145
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,440
know we did a

1146
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,520
a poll and we talked about you know the

1147
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,599
two and there was strong consensus

1148
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:48,640
towards

1149
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,920
if we had a single one um a single mti

1150
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,040
uh to

1151
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,280
to to make the hash based you know the

1152
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,839
the mti i think that was largely driven

1153
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,839
by the discussion around quantum

1154
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,760
resistance so we wanted something that

1155
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,000
would last

1156
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:15,119
i guess as chairs are we ready to uh

1157
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,720
say that we have

1158
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,240
between this discussion and the

1159
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,920
discussion we had at there that you were

1160
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,520
just summarizing david are we saying

1161
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,319
that

1162
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,240
that is the proposed consensus let us

1163
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,930
know if we've misread consensus

1164
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:30,149
[Music]

1165
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,240
that makes sense to me

1166
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:39,849
[Music]

1167
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,960
ira asks a question in the chat about um

1168
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,599
why would why ecdsa being issued rather

1169
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,760
than e-d-d-s-a is the question

1170
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,680
okay michael just responded to the

1171
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,760
answer okay

1172
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,480
right

1173
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,160
well i i mean

1174
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,000
from that perspective perhaps we need to

1175
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,200
have a few more uh options available uh

1176
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,920
in the optional to implement

1177
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,280
yep

1178
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,839
um so i'm just doing time check we're at

1179
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,160
uh 15 minutes after the hour now do you

1180
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,440
want to go on to the next presentation

1181
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,880
now

1182
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,480
i think maybe this is one for the list

1183
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,079
exactly what we're proposing

1184
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,000
we need to confirm it on the list i

1185
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,200
think that's right that that h

1186
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,240
ss lms will be the mandatory

1187
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,359
that

1188
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,800
ecdsa is assured and anything else is a

1189
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,800
may

1190
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,040
we're declaring as the consensus from

1191
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,240
this discussion which we will then need

1192
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,680
to confirm on the list so i think we can

1193
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,960
go on to the next presentation unless

1194
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,560
there's any objections or new technical

1195
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,560
information

1196
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,280
i think firmware encryption yeah we

1197
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,079
we've only got 15 minutes left so we

1198
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,680
kind of need to pick up the pace

1199
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,040
so who's presenting this one okay i

1200
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,720
tried to be fast hope you can hear me

1201
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,800
can you can you hear me

1202
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,319
you hear you fine

1203
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,079
okay cool uh

1204
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,839
yeah so this is um a short

1205
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,160
update on the firmware encryption uh we

1206
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,040
had

1207
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,960
a good discussion at the last iedf

1208
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,359
meeting and there were two main aspects

1209
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,760
there one was to

1210
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,520
um take the

1211
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,400
hp key the hybrid public key encryption

1212
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,839
and make that a standalone cozy method

1213
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:47,280
which we did there's a separate document

1214
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,720
available

1215
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,680
and that would be discussed in the cosi

1216
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,119
working group

1217
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,400
um i'm not going into the details so

1218
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,760
essentially was extracted content from

1219
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,960
the suit working group document that

1220
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,280
was brought into this one

1221
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,400
uh and the other thing was we had um two

1222
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,599
attacks

1223
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:10,720
listed

1224
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,079
and uh

1225
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,760
in the presentation from the last itf

1226
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,079
meeting and uh those

1227
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,040
or the

1228
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,200
the mitigations of those have been

1229
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,119
incorporated into this version and i

1230
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,800
have um

1231
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,079
two slides

1232
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,000
that talk about those uh just as a

1233
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,160
summary on what the solution is the

1234
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,240
first one was

1235
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,400
an issue with uh

1236
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,720
sort of had to put the

1237
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,160
um

1238
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,319
sort of the the content of the

1239
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,720
encryption information uh because

1240
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,000
it uh had to be in the envelope and so

1241
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,920
it couldn't be the manifest

1242
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,400
uh so that's what we what we did uh this

1243
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,720
is essentially something that uh was

1244
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,480
carried over from uh brenton's

1245
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,520
presentation about the uh document split

1246
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,760
um so conceptually this was in the the

1247
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,520
suit manifest

1248
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,000
are just in a different

1249
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,920
language i would say

1250
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,960
um

1251
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,040
so this is just

1252
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,800
essentially the suit encryption input

1253
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,200
tag in the envelope the envelope as a

1254
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,760
reminder is not protected by the digital

1255
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,800
signature

1256
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,480
uh itself

1257
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,319
but it manifest this okay next slide

1258
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:24,880
and the other one

1259
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,960
was about

1260
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,800
a verification

1261
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,880
i'm sort of mechanism to allow

1262
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,359
uh the prevention of battery exhaustion

1263
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,200
so when the device receives the firmware

1264
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,400
update

1265
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,240
it wants to perform

1266
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,559
as little operations as possible to

1267
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,240
determine whether the payload it

1268
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,960
receives is actually

1269
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,160
correct

1270
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,599
or it has been

1271
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,200
properly signed

1272
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,079
um

1273
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:53,920
and properly encrypted in this specific

1274
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,520
case actually

1275
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,400
and so what we did here isn't and

1276
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,319
there's still a dupe down here but there

1277
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,319
uh in a nutshell the idea is that

1278
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:03,440
there's a

1279
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,400
this

1280
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,559
um a byte sequence

1281
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,960
in the manifest that

1282
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,720
uh is um where we apply the content

1283
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,079
encryption key

1284
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,040
on

1285
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,920
a string of eight bytes with a specific

1286
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,440
character like

1287
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,640
this in this case uh hex a5

1288
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,160
uh it doesn't really matter what it is

1289
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,520
but uh

1290
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,119
um that

1291
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,920
allows the consumer to

1292
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,200
check

1293
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,760
with the keck that it got

1294
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,920
whether this um

1295
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,400
this string actually

1296
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,119
decrypts properly so the only open issue

1297
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,119
here is what i need to use and that's in

1298
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,480
the document that's something we still

1299
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,240
have to hash out but um yeah

1300
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,558
okay

1301
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,280
good uh so

1302
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,240
so this was um sort of the current uh

1303
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,800
sort of updates and the approaches for

1304
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,000
addressing

1305
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,839
the threats that we talked about last

1306
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,359
time and and we also talked about

1307
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,680
different solutions and this is one of

1308
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,400
them so please have a look at this um

1309
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,200
there's also a code for the hb key which

1310
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,960
i created and i've also been working on

1311
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,400
a cozy uh the corresponding cozy code uh

1312
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,800
which i need to clean up and

1313
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,280
and will be published out soon what we

1314
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,040
are still lacking is uh interrupt

1315
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,280
testing on this functionality unlike for

1316
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,800
some of the other features in the main

1317
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,040
specification which which we have tested

1318
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:29,920
uh

1319
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,119
already

1320
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,440
and i i just talked about this open

1321
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,359
issue uh

1322
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:36,960
a second ago

1323
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,040
and yeah that's

1324
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,119
that's all there is so i i hope the

1325
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,520
discussion in the cozy meeting goes well

1326
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,040
so that we can then reference this of

1327
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,319
course there will be

1328
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,680
uh changes um i expect changes to the

1329
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,760
cosy hpke document itself as we

1330
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,359
try to make it more general and

1331
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,920
applicable to use cases beyond uh

1332
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,520
firmware encryption

1333
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,400
um

1334
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,680
but

1335
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,680
i think that's a that's a good

1336
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,280
a good approach

1337
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,710
going forward

1338
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:10,319
[Music]

1339
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:11,680
that's all i had for the firmware

1340
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,680
encryption

1341
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,680
okay so those are two uh current working

1342
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,760
group documents the other two although

1343
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,599
they came split out of a working group

1344
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:30,960
document their current individual

1345
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,720
submissions do we have a preference

1346
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,880
between the other two which one to cover

1347
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,240
given that we've got eight minutes left

1348
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,119
here uh between trust domains and update

1349
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,880
management

1350
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,960
mike i i i observe that you told us the

1351
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,280
the thinking behind the split out in

1352
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,640
your previous presentation so

1353
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,960
um i think we leave it to brendan to

1354
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,319
tell us uh

1355
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:57,040
where where the open issues might lead

1356
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,400
to more

1357
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,839
group participation

1358
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,000
brandon which one would you like to go

1359
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,640
to probably the more interesting one

1360
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,000
especially because of the team

1361
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,680
dependency

1362
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,319
trust domains

1363
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,599
uh yes please

1364
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,079
okay go ahead

1365
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,440
all right uh next slide please

1366
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:25,200
oh right uh video um

1367
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,839
so essentially this is simply just an

1368
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:28,880
export

1369
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,040
it contains the delegation chains

1370
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,880
dependencies and multiple suit

1371
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,280
processors and unlinked directive next

1372
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,680
elise

1373
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,480
there is a dependency

1374
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,079
from t on this particular draft um

1375
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:45,280
although i don't know if that's been

1376
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,000
declared yet uh it's just the things

1377
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,079
that i know t depends on got moved to

1378
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,839
this draft

1379
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,400
next please

1380
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,839
so uh delegation chains are essentially

1381
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:01,440
just a list of lists of sibor web tokens

1382
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,400
the idea behind this is that in each

1383
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,559
list the first element is a cwt that can

1384
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,960
be verified against a trust anchor and

1385
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,440
the last element is

1386
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,720
contains the key that you can use to

1387
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,599
verify a manifest so it's essentially

1388
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,400
just a chain of signed elements each one

1389
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,960
containing a public key

1390
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,040
each element should

1391
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,760
authenticate the following one in each

1392
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,640
individual list

1393
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:33,839
and

1394
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,559
obviously there's options for a device

1395
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,160
to skip ahead if it recognizes something

1396
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,720
next please

1397
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,640
dependencies so these are a fundamental

1398
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,880
component of suit or word and they've

1399
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,280
heavily influenced the design of suit

1400
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,319
this is why suit has multiple sections

1401
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:59,440
rather than one single list of uh

1402
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,040
elements it should

1403
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,200
or one single list of

1404
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,720
things it should do

1405
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,040
this essentially uh

1406
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,680
it was for dependency lock step

1407
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,799
processing that was the the uh the suit

1408
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,559
command sequences were split apart like

1409
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:15,440
that

1410
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,760
um

1411
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,880
and there's all the the requirements of

1412
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,359
dependencies that come with that and

1413
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,359
it's also necessary to support encrypted

1414
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,240
manifests i think that's an important uh

1415
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,399
thing to recognize next slide please

1416
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,520
so integrated dependencies are when a

1417
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,119
dependency is placed in the suit

1418
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,200
envelope and that will be

1419
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,280
probably how encrypted manifests are

1420
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,880
typically uh delivered and those are

1421
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,319
covered in this

1422
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,799
document as well and they have the same

1423
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:52,000
reference semantics as i described for

1424
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,559
integrated elements in the previous

1425
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,079
presentation thanks please

1426
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,440
multiple suit processors are also

1427
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,599
covered and that's when you have

1428
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:07,119
multiple mutually distrustful man

1429
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,839
processing environments in a single

1430
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,280
device

1431
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,280
in in the classic iot case the most

1432
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,319
likely thing i've encountered is a radio

1433
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,880
module that has a signature of its own

1434
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,839
firmware um and that is signed by a

1435
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:24,640
different trust anchor than the uh the

1436
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,000
app the the

1437
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,400
firmware for the application uh which is

1438
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,400
running on a separate processor so the

1439
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,040
idea behind multiple suit processors is

1440
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,200
that you have a dependency that has its

1441
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,760
own signature and it hands over a

1442
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,319
component to another processor which

1443
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,480
then processes its own

1444
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,200
suit manifest and return some status

1445
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,440
information

1446
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,240
next slide please

1447
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,920
the unlinked directive was uh

1448
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,079
specifically requested by

1449
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,280
uh

1450
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,599
by t i'm not sure if it's quite in the

1451
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,119
right form and i think we'll have a

1452
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,200
debate about that within the

1453
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,480
discussion this week uh but

1454
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,799
that's uh also covered in this document

1455
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:10,880
next slide please

1456
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,640
yeah i just want to give a quick ad here

1457
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,119
that the teep session is the first

1458
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,160
session on friday morning and so that

1459
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,400
one the teep session will be discussion

1460
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,319
of the use of uh suit in teep uh

1461
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,640
akira and ken are both here in this

1462
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,480
meeting and they both filed issues

1463
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,319
relating to suit manifests and teep and

1464
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:33,040
so i'd like to encourage um everybody uh

1465
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,799
that wants to follow this topic also

1466
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:35,839
please come to that meeting because

1467
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,119
we're not gonna have time to discuss it

1468
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,440
here but uh there may be time in the tea

1469
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,400
meeting on friday so

1470
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,119
uh so

1471
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:51,920
then there is just the question of the

1472
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,359
open issues

1473
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:55,359
we don't have any running code for most

1474
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:56,400
of it

1475
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:56,820
um

1476
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,160
[Music]

1477
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,400
i'm concerned that we're using about

1478
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,240
whether or not we're using the

1479
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,880
seaboard web tokens correctly

1480
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,000
and

1481
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,640
yeah any contribution would be

1482
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,640
massively welcome

1483
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,599
um

1484
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:14,079
that's it

1485
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,760
uh both this document and the uh the

1486
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,720
other one that was the uh update

1487
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,799
management are both draft moran right

1488
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,960
now uh this is a question of the working

1489
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,359
group both of these have i think content

1490
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:30,880
that was originally pulled out of the

1491
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,040
original suit manifest document so that

1492
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,040
we could take the original one as the

1493
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,760
minimum one and uh go to rfc as soon as

1494
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,400
possible and i think none of the content

1495
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,839
was pulled out of there because people

1496
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:44,799
objected it to having it be in suit and

1497
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:48,240
so i guess uh the proposal that i would

1498
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,920
have would be are there any objections

1499
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,760
to taking both of these documents and

1500
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,319
adopting them as draft ietf rats

1501
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,880
documents to put them back as official

1502
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,160
working group documents which they were

1503
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,119
before right that's the that should be i

1504
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:02,640
believe the next step i just want to

1505
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,319
verify that there's no objections to

1506
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,079
that yeah draft ietf rats thank you

1507
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,960
michael um

1508
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:14,240
yeah sorry uh draft ietf suit

1509
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,680
yeah sorry if i miss said that i just

1510
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,880
came from the red sweetie right before

1511
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,839
this sorry

1512
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,000
okay as long as there's no objections

1513
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,440
then that is the normal thing because

1514
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,119
these came out of a suit document to

1515
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:26,480
begin with so they were already working

1516
