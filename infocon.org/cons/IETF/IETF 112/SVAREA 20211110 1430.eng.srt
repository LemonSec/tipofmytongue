pitchforks uh thank you to lucas for

16
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,720
taking the minutes today

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,040
uh this is the notewell you've seen this

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,799
probably about eight times already this

19
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,040
week and many many times before it if

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,479
you have any questions about it just

21
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,920
please type it into your favorite search

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,119
engine basically you know this covers uh

23
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,400
some behavioral rules and um

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,159
uh

25
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,040
some

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,479
so just how to handle intellectual

27
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,960
property at ietf um

28
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,960
i think in other working groups

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
uh there's been a bit of an emphasis on

30
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,759
the code of conduct this this cycle um

31
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,439
we're really asking this is not usually

32
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,000
a problem in tsp area but uh in at least

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,240
this meeting but um

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,000
you know just treat each other respect

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,640
please and uh you know if if we find

36
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,040
advan examples of of unprofessional

37
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,200
behavior as as leaders we will try to

38
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,880
call that out and establish that is not

39
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,440
the norm on how we want to do things

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,440
i don't anticipate that being a problem

41
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,360
in this group but just uh you know

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,959
something we're sharing across the board

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,520
so this is the agenda we we're going to

44
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,120
have a talk but it fell through at kind

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,520
of the last minute so um you are likely

46
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,760
to get out of here early and i encourage

47
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,680
you going to gather and mingle after

48
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,520
this um we're just going to run through

49
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,959
the regular

50
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,360
uh

51
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,440
review of what the what the area did

52
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,800
we'll open up for open mic so this

53
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,720
should be a quick one um we're not gonna

54
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,640
have a jab rescribe because i think uh

55
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,080
zahed and i can probably manage looking

56
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,959
at jabra as much as needed

57
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,720
all right here we go

58
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,560
is there would anyone like to bash the

59
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,560
agenda

60
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,640
okay

61
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,280
all right here's what's going on um

62
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,680
in working groups uh i think that the

63
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,560
three

64
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,120

65
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,280

70
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,159
um

71
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,800
similarly uh tram

72
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,080
um is

73
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,080
well my intention as i announced on the

74
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,480
list is to shut down tram um

75
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,959
there's one document remaining

76
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,519
uh which is uh kind of in deep freeze

77
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,040
right now frankly

78
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,560
uh and nothing has happened as we're

79
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,720
good for a while so uh

80
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,040
the draft has expired so it's sort of

81
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,840
nowhere right now but should the work to

82
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,519
do pmtud and tram resume

83
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,080
uh that work will occur in the tsvwg

84
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,879
working group and tsvwg will have

85
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,440
custody of all the tram rfcs

86
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,360
so um like i said i've announced this on

87
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,519
the relevant lists uh if you have any

88
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,840

i don't know but there's much else to

100

101
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,720
interest to in my working groups at

102
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,400
least the one thing that might be of

103
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,919
general interest to the transport

104
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,040
community

105
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,600
is kind of the core tcp stuff is moving

106
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,960
is beginning best in tcpm like 793 is

107
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,680

uh having a more modern connection

111
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,680
control formally standardized

112
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,600
and then um there are a number of

113
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,919
reasons that we're looking to bust 5681

114
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,759
which is kind of the core loss recovery

115
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,800
and um document for tcp

116
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,639
and uh we're looking for authors at this

117
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,160
time so if this is interesting to you um

118
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,720
please contact the tcpm chairs

119
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,039
um

120
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,440
so i had do you want to highlight

121
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,160
anything in your working groups

122
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,639
yes let's do that uh so well i'll just

123
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,240
run down the

124
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,639
the list here um so dtn working group

125
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,039
there we're doing some recharging we

126
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,400
have been

127
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,160
putting up a new charter for isb

128
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,520
internal review when there were some

129
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,600
blocks and now we work through that with

130
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,680
those things i think the blocks were

131
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,759
just

132
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,840
lift off so um it will progress then or

133
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,360
next phase

134
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,120
and the focus of this returning is more

135
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,000
like doing some ops and management work

136
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,080
and addressing work along with the

137
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,759
transport related issues that they have

138
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,600
been doing i mean this is

139
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,280
an interesting

140
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,800
time for dtn because people are

141
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,479
deploying and then we're getting lots of

142
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,759
um

143
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,880
input how it works

144
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,560
and if it's before i think business as

145
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,720
usual mostly working on the security

146
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
document

147
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,919
so far um and also this rdm and version

148
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,280
2 documents quick i think uh just came

149
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,120
from a lot of us came from quick working

150
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,800
groups so you already know what's going

151
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,280
on there the there are traps in the edit

152
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,520
review i'm going through them uh those

153
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,199
are very good well written documents so

154
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,560
far i've seen

155
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,520
um decreasing just completed the

156
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,120
working last call

157
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,440
and i think there was some discussion we

158
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,240
we heard in the today's quick meeting

159
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,560
about multipath week

160
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,960
armcad after a long time taking up uh

161
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,800
work that i think that is the last

162
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,039
working document working document to

163
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,160
work with this is about how you send the

164
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,520
feedback

165
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,000
taps i will say business as usual the

166
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,240
taps architecture document when past the

167
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,919

168
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,400
and then interface documents is working

169
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,599
lost call

170
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,639
so that's it uh so far from my working

171
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,639
groups

172
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,639
a couple of other things uh first of all

173
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,039
i neglected to thank the tram chairs

174
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,240
gonzalo and simone um for your

175
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,880
actual frankly tram predates my uh deep

176
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,199
involvement in the area as a whole but

177
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,720
uh you know obviously there's a lot of

178
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,240
documents that came out of tram and they

179
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,680
they were the ones that brought it along

180
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,440
so thank you for your contributions to

181
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,720
the itf

182
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,639
uh i i also want to talk a little about

183
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,520
the last little phrase down there um

184
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,199
there's a lot of multipath work going on

185
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,199
in the area all of a sudden um

186
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,960
you know mptcp closed a couple years ago

187
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,520
there are some sctp proposals

188
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,759
and by multipath i mean sending data

189
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,160
concurrently over multiple paths not you

190
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,800
know failover there are some http drafts

191
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,759
that's

192
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,840
whose status is in seriousness is not

193
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,199
frankly certain

194
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,039
and tsvwg has adopted mpdccp

195
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,160
and uh

196
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,000
based on what just happened in quick it

197
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,840
looks like they're likely to adopt mp

198
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,639
quick um i i think those drafts are all

199
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,800
properly housed in the individual

200
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,319
protocol

201
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,599
places

202
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,520
that said um

203
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,039
there are a lot of common problems in

204
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,720
multi-path like

205
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,879
scheduling and congestion control that

206
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,039
then my view are not really resolved

207
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,639
and um

208
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,840
i i think

209
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,840
now that we i think quick in particular

210
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,759
is an excellent experimental platform

211
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,960
for

212
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,879
for uh multi-path experimentation

213
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,080
because it's likely to get through the

214
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,000
internet um

215
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,560
uh and like

216
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,400
we're so i had to kick you around the

217
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,319
idea of some sort of bumpy path group

218
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,840
maybe a research group maybe a working

219
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,039
group um

220
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,958
for that research and you know if you

221
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,719
have any thoughts on this

222
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,080
um

223
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,200
whether it's mature enough to be a

224
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,240
working group or um

225
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,279
or not

226
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,200
to to handle that there

227
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
uh

228
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,160
yeah lucas go ahead

229
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,959
hey thanks um yeah just just on that

230
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,040
note uh the

231
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,640
the the presentation that was just given

232
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,800
to the quick working group was you know

233
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,720
effectively a very small core of what

234
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,200
multipath quick could could be from a

235
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,959
protocol level to help deliver some of

236
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,880
the use cases and a lot of what you just

237
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,040
mentioned like scheduling and stuff is

238
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,440
like out of scope but clearly needs to

239
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,320
be done somewhere um maybe in parallel

240
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
maybe somewhere else i don't quite know

241
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,240
so i support the general

242
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,839
idea of

243
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,040
someone

244
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,040
thinking about this problem so thank you

245
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,839
and

246
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,200
um yeah

247
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,839
i'll be watching and and can participate

248
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,600
maybe in some way

249
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,800
yeah zach and i will have another

250
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,839
conversation with colin and um

251
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,120
uh if

252
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,040
if there's a lot of work sitting around

253
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,399
and we'll put out a call to see if

254
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,839
there's a work staying around out in the

255
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,519
wings that it's ready to go in a group

256
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,720
somewhere

257
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,399
uh and then a lot lastly sctp um

258
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,240
there are a lot of scp drafts flowing

259
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,320
around tsvdwg apparently again it's not

260
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,240
100 clear how many people how many of

261
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,480
those are going to be adopted but i i do

262
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,080
understand that there's sort of an

263
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
infinite stream of proposals that the

264
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
tsvwg is working through

265
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,079
and that um

266
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,320
is potentially grounds to do a working

267
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,640
group just to do all this sctp stuff and

268
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,880
i think the question is how much that

269
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,320
work benefits from being in the tcwg um

270
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,880
tcpg is obviously quite loaded with

271
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,040
stuff um so if it's just if they're just

272
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,480
a bunch of people

273
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,399
sitting on their hands while the until

274
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,279
the sct people stop talking then um

275
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,720
maybe it makes sense to be its own group

276
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,320
but if there's a lot of valuable

277
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,920
cross-fertilization that happens maybe

278
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,519
it should stay where it is so i would

279
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,720
welcome your input on that as well

280
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,480
okay um not not the most um

281
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,680
productive interval in terms of

282
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,279
documents but there's a ton of things

283
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,120
sitting in the ad key it's a various

284
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,440
stages of a d and is g of l so some for

285
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,279
outside us and some of that's on authors

286
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,680
responding to feedback but regardless we

287
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
did ship um one thing from dtn the

288
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,600
default security context

289
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,399
and uh two things went out the rfc door

290
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,399
um

291
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,040
wait 90 40 i think was before anyway

292
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,160
regardless

293
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,519
um

294
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,000
uh 1997 of course uh congratulations to

295
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,560
al and his co-authors uh on the ip

296
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,360
capacity metrics draft which was spent

297
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,680
forever in rc head for various reasons

298
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,800
and of course there's a bunch of stuff

299
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,399
sitting in the queue that's that's

300
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,959
waiting on things most notably http 3

301
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,720
but certainly a lot of other items as

302
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,920
well you can see at the bottom there

303
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,760
congratulations to the authors uh so

304
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,720
this is the um this is our

305
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,680
three times um a year

306
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,920
tsv art review team

307
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,920
discussion um

308
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,959
so the tsv area review team

309
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,720
helps us in our av reviews by uh by like

310
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,560
highlighting transport issues and drafts

311
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,360
from across the itf if they are judged

312
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,760
to have any transport implications at

313
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,560
all

314
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,440
um

315
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,360
so thank you to the viewers for doing

316
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,800
these reviews i've got there in

317
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,160
parentheses the number of reviews they

318
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,920
had to do in the last cycle since ietf

319
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,200
111 um so i think uh you know we're

320
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,160
certainly interested in having more

321
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,920
volunteers and and i think that number

322
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,360
indicates that

323
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,839
the load is not huge that we ask people

324
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,800
to review less than one draft per cycle

325
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,639
so um thank you to volunteers for having

326
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,040
a big enough pool to make the workload

327
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,360
light and um if you would like to join i

328
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,120
think it's a great way to get a window

329
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,720
into some of the other things going on

330
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,600
in the itf that are of interest so just

331
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,399
one correction here i think jonah uh

332
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,800
reviewed one so sorry jonah we didn't

333
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,920
okay

334
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,680
maybe it happened recently because yeah

335
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,519
that happened recently i think after we

336
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,360
have profit thank you john

337
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,279
so thank you

338
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,360
and that is the last slide so uh let's

339
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,800
go ahead and go to open mic

340
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,200
and we invite your comments on um really

341
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,639
anything at all but you know we've had

342
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,040
some discussion about new groups and uh

343
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,480
tram shutting down

344
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,560
so uh let us know what you think spencer

345
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,279
yeah you can always count on me right

346
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,000
um thank you thank you for thank you for

347
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,320
the description of

348
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,880
uh multipath in the session

349
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,399
um

350
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,519
it

351
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,120
you you mean so you may you're

352
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,760
mentioning the impact of

353
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,200
on things like congestion control

354
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,240
and

355
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,360
i think that there are

356
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,200
i i think i think i'm seeing other

357
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,600
impacts of multi-path

358
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,560
uh

359
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,240
that that

360
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,160
could come up you know i think one of

361
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,760
the things i've been talking about for a

362
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,440
bit is the thing about the difference

363
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,680
between maybe maybe i should be

364
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,440
describing this as low-level scheduling

365
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,600
decisions versus high-level strategy

366
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,040
decisions

367
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,320
um

368
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,240
basically what are you know what are you

369
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,720
trying to do versus what are you trying

370
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,560
to do with this packet

371
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,920
um

372
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,399
one of the things that

373
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,760
has come up in a discussion recently

374
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,600
that i'm still trying to get my

375
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,680
head around is the thing is the thing

376
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
about

377
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,760
interaction between

378
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,040
different

379
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,959
kinds of

380
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,199
traffic

381
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,040
within an application

382
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,600
and uh i'm

383
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,440
do

384
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,000
that's still iccrg territory as far as

385
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,800
you guys are concerned or how do you see

386
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,920
that

387
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,160
um

388
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,480
i don't think i've got a a well-formed

389
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,000
charter for this group whether it's

390
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
research or working group i mean first

391
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,199
of all if it's a research group that's

392
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,839
not even really my business

393
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,639
yeah but but iccrg is obviously doing a

394
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,839
good job um yeah i know donna john at

395
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,000
times has expressed a little skepticism

396
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,680
that he has the right skill set in that

397
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,440
group to to really review multi-path

398
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,720
condition control

399
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,600
um

400
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,199
so if it

401
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,800
if he wants to take it i'm not going to

402
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,040
try to rip it out of his hands but um i

403
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,240
think that i think the point that i

404
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,880
would like to make is is that

405
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,680
um

406
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,320
we now have four multipath transports uh

407
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,279
in some

408
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,399
some states

409
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,000
yeah yeah we're saying multi-path right

410
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,800
yeah

411
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,600
yeah so they're now forward they're sure

412
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,360
so so they're full multi-path transports

413
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,519
and um they all have like some sort of

414
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,880
failover mechanism and and uh

415
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,160
to do true like multi-path delivery

416
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,040
um

417
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,639
has this common set of problems that

418
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,639
don't really live in tcpm or quick

419
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,959
working group or tsvwg or they could

420
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,560
live in tsavg but i think that's too

421
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,199
much in tsvwg so there ought to be a

422
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,440
forum for this stuff um

423
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,120
as this matures whether it's research or

424
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,000
working group i'm i'm totally open to

425
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,440
people's assessment of the maturity of

426
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,120
these these solutions

427
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,720
um

428
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,320
but that's that's what we're inviting

429
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,720
comment on

430
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,519
because i hadn't even got it

431
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,600
no i think i used it all i think i think

432
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,199
you said it all right

433
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,199
i think the main important factor is

434
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,120
that somebody is working on into

435
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,600
thinking about those things and whether

436
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
it's the research group on an existing

437
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,839
room one or a new one we can always

438
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,160
discuss that one

439
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,920
yeah i mean

440
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,079
i'll i'll i'll just say one more thing

441
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,240
and then i'll shut up and turn my video

442
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,720
off but uh the thing we did with uh

443
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,360
hip in the past where you know the

444
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,320
research

445
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,759
you know it was it was the same problem

446
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,759
but this the research the research

447
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,000
topics had a had a research group and a

448
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,560
uh and the stuff that had matured the

449
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,199
engineering was being done in the ietf

450
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,880
with engineers and things like that but

451
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,320
i mean there was

452
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,920
overlap between the two groups and

453
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,240
things like that that's not a guarantee

454
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,759
for success and there are

455
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,120
there are different ways that that could

456
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,600
be done but uh just something to to

457
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,680
mention to you all that you are going to

458
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,959
be the ones that have to figure out what

459
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,880
to do right

460
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,480
thank you

461
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,839
thanks spencer magnus

462
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,559
yes

463
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,280
uh i just need to notice that as the one

464
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
of the triage in the tsvr

465
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,679
you missed also michael scharf uh he had

466
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,439
also did another review so

467
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,720
just in the last week so uh

468
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
okay so like the slide specifically says

469
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
through 10 26 so

470
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,640
or 26 10 for those of you in the united

471
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,720
states so i'm sorry that i didn't bother

472
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,240
to update the slide to reflect light

473
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,000
reviews yeah

474
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,240
yeah but thank you to all of you it was

475
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,400
really enormously helpful for me i know

476
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
personally is when i do isg reviews to

477
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,280
have these in hand

478
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,919
anything else magnus

479
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,400
okay um this could be a very short

480
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,600
session i guess uh

481
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,320
going once

482
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,360
