hello

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,480
all right i think uh

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,039
i think it would be good to get started

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,359
uh welcome to the second session on

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,640

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,480
my name's uh mark mcfadden i'm one of

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,840
the co-chairs

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,079
braun is the handsome one in the video

11

and um

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,079
and what my goal here is is to get the

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,600
preliminaries out of the way so that we

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,440
can have a good discussion

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,120
so good morning good afternoon and good

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,039
evening to all of you

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,640
um

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,440
let's see here if i can do this

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,800
uh here's the

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,038
ah

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,800
here's the note well

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,319
um the

23
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,400
the chairs are advised to stress the

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
note well this time and it's it's good

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,840
for you to

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,159
remind yourself of what's in here one of

27
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,600
the things that i want to take just a

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,119
moment to do

29
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,400
is to uh remind you of

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,040
the fact that the i the work in the ietf

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,840
is

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,880
human collaboration and as a result that

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,720
collaboration

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,520
works best when people are respectful to

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,920
each other understand the fact that they

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,840
have different backgrounds

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,920
and so

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
one of the things to know is that we

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,360
have guidelines for conduct we have an

40
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,799
anti-harassment policy

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,280
and we also have a group of people

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,799
who are

43
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,680
both trained up and willing to help

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,840
address any harassment issues

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,119
so

46
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,119
i put this slide in the slide deck just

47
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,439
as a reminder to all of us i don't think

48
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,280
there's a problem in sedate in fact i

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,840
know there's not a problem in sedate but

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,240
if you experience this either in sedate

51
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,320
or in any other working group you have

52
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,800
resources to use uh and as a code of

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
conduct for the rest of us i think this

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,280
is particularly important

55
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,160
um uh the agenda here i'll i'll do a

56
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,760
little bit of agenda bashing but not

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,640
much

58
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,800
because i really want to focus entirely

59
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,080
on the document that we have and i'm

60
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,840
going to basically turn it over to

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,440
carsten to do that

62
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,840
uh i have already talked about the note

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,920
well as i said we have a

64
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,680
the working group has a single document

65
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,760
that's the one we're going to talk about

66
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,360
let me just talk a few minutes about

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,560
a liaison here's some potentially useful

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,160
information

69
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,519
there is a

70
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,680
github repository

71
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,599
where the pull requests are being

72
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,519
collected uh for our our document and uh

73
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,760
of course the charter is in the usual

74
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,680
place can be found on data tracker in

75
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,519
the usual way

76
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,920
um our charter talks about a liaison and

77
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,879
the chairs have had a conversation

78
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,519
back in august with the iab to

79
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,319
request a liaison

80
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,239
to tc-39

81
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,480
the iab agreed in the beginning of

82
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,920
october

83
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,319
to go ahead and do a liaison that

84
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,920
process is a formal uh iab process

85
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,400
uh that basically got kicked off on

86
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,000
october 5th

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,760
uh the ieb asked for candidates and on

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,799
october 22nd

89
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,280
the iab had a list of candidates

90
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,400
volunteers and has started interviewing

91
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
those volunteers

92
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,840
i do have

93
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,599
information that some of those

94
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,360
volunteers have been contacted by the

95
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,239
ieb and the iab is hoping to make

96
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,720
progress on that process um quickly

97
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,120
after ietf112

98
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,439
so unless there are questions here i

99
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,200
think that

100
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
what i'll promise to do is i'll promise

101
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,760
to keep the mailing list informed about

102
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,120
the progress uh for this liaison because

103
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,200
as you know we're trying to make

104
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,560
progress on this

105
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,879
document fairly quickly wrap up the

106
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,280
working group fairly quickly and so one

107
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,360
of the things we said to the iab is we

108
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,600
need progress on the liaison

109
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,918
in short order as well

110
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,160
so that's my update on the liaison and

111
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,520
my promise to the working group

112
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,320
basically is that as i hear things from

113
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,280
the ieb i'll continue to

114
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,960
let the mailing list know about the

115
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,320
progress we're making on the liaison

116
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,919
so let me just pause for a second and

117
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,198
see if there any questions

118
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
okay well i'm pleased to say that the uh

119
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,199
meat of the agenda is to be turned over

120
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,000
to the discussion of our one document

121
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,840
this was as you know adopted as a

122
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,840
working group item the last time we got

123
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,880
together

124
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,199
uh there's a new version available uh

125
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,479
dasha1

126
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,960
uh carson sent out uh carsten has

127
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,560
actually done a lot of work and i'm not

128
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,680
going to

129
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,759
steal his fire here steal his thunder

130
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,840
i'm gonna just let him talk in a second

131
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,199
you can see the mailing list for the

132
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,120
outline of issues and in the last five

133
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,080
days

134
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,000
there has been a really healthy and i

135
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,840
think really positive discussion on the

136
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,680
mailing list

137
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,720
and

138
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,199
lots of good proposals and so

139
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,520
without any further ado let me turn it

140
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,759
over to carson

141
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,919
to he has some slides

142
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,280
and um i just would like carsten to

143
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,400
manage the discussion

144
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,840
let me stop sharing my screen

145
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,720
okay so you now all

146
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,880
should see

147
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,039
my slides and if somebody enables it

148
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,520
also me

149
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,440
those look good yeah

150
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,039
i look good too but you can't see it

151
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,720
you have to know you need to turn your

152
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,319
video on separately if you want to do

153
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,680
that

154
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,319
yes i did a video request oh no i didn't

155
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,280
uh you've done a screen request

156
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,360
yeah we think it can be so confusing

157
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,520
thank you

158
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,440
sorry about that

159
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,280
okay so um

160
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,479
let's jump right into where we are so on

161
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,120
october 20th we had a new version of the

162
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,199
draft

163
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,680
there are some some eight issues open on

164
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,039
github which

165
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,360
maybe don't cover

166
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,000
the whole ground here

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,080
so i propose the structure of discussion

168
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,639
with five points one two five

169
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,680
uh but given what has happened on the

170
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,960
mailing list i inserted a point zero

171
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
which we probably have to do before we

172
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,080
go to

173
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,560
uh one two five

174
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,400
um and the point zero is what are we

175
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,840
doing here anyway

176
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,759
um so um the the charter tells us that

177
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,800
we are

178
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,400
extending rfc 33 39

179
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,759
time stamps and

180
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,440
where we could do this to provide

181
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,960
additional information and that's

182
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,440
actually what the charter talks about

183
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,080
um or we could also do this to to

184
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,560
actually change the semantics so the the

185
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,400
timestamp on its own means something

186
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,680
different than

187
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,759
the timestamp with the extensions that

188
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,560
that we have added

189
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,680
so just to remind people what 3339 does

190
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,880
for us

191
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,440
it gives us a utc timestamp and it gives

192
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,319
us

193
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,800
the ability to add an annotation which

194
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,840
is a time zone offset and numeric offset

195
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,639
that

196
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,520
allows you to understand which time zone

197
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,599
this particular time was

198
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,960
meant to be in

199
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
but not in the sense of a human readable

200
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,720
time zone but just in the sense of time

201
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,879
zone offset

202
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,759
and

203
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,000
yeah it's a matter of syntax that when

204
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,520
you do that the

205
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,160
time that you actually look at no longer

206
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,879
is utc but is in that offset but that's

207
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,960
just just that's not a semantic thing

208
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,400
it's just the way the way this is

209
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,039
represented

210
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,639
so i

211
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,280
try to summarize what happened on the

212
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,199
the mailing list in particular i'm

213
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,599
referencing this particular mail which

214
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,520
you unfortunately cannot click on but

215
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,240
it's one of the most recent

216
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,760
mails that were

217
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,880
sent

218
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,399
on the mailing list

219
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,440
so on the annotation side where we keep

220
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,560
33 39 unchanged but just add more

221
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,080
information

222
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,720
uh we certainly have the the proposal to

223
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,800
add a human readable time zone

224
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,279
so i can say that sometime actually is

225
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,279
in the your berlin

226
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,440
time zone and not just that it's a plus

227
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,279
0100 or plus 0 depending on

228
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,440
the time of the year

229
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,320
and

230
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,839
of course there are also other

231
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,959
annotations display hints

232
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,560
and so on that can go there and

233
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,440
but the point is this is still a 3339

234
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,560
timestamp just with some additional

235
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,480
helpful information

236
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,560
so any 3339

237
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,880
implementation can be modified to just

238
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,560
ignore

239
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,120
everything that is in this new extension

240
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,800
syntax for instance by ignoring

241
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,880
everything that starts with a

242
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,279
open square bracket and and we have

243
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,000
perfect interability

244
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,399
um but we also have been talking about

245
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,920
other things including modifications

246
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,240
and in particular there is this thing

247
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,839
that that was called b in this

248
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,399
list where we have essentially the same

249
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,160
information you have a 33 39 time stamp

250
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,880
plus a human readable time zone

251
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,959
but we actually mean

252
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,040
that the human readable time zone

253
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,200
overrides the time zone offset if the

254
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,040
semantics of that human readable time

255
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,440
zone changes from the time

256
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,640
the

257
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,800
timestamp is generated to the time the

258
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
time storm the time

259
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,440
stamp is consumed

260
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,560
and

261
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,399
there are some

262
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,880
details how you can do this but i think

263
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,839
the the point here really is

264
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,320
this is a kind of time stamp

265
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,279
that is a little bit wobbling around

266
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,440
based on on politic politicians

267
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,560
decisions

268
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,480
uh but after a while it actually

269
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,920
converges to to an actual timestamp

270
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,760
it's just a little bit more

271
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,480
difficult to interpret it because you

272
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,320
have to have access to a current

273
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,680
time zone information database

274
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,079
so that that's

275
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,560
something different from from the

276
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,320
annotation thing that's why i called it

277
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,920
modification thing

278
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,160
and then of course there are other

279
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,399
modifications one can think about for

280
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,079
instance time scales i think that would

281
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,320
be a really useful thing to have but

282
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,360
still it's a modification so again if

283
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,680
we say this looks like an rfc 3339

284
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,000
timestamp but it really is in tai and

285
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,680
not in utc

286
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,120
uh that that's changing the semantics

287
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,320
and finally there have been

288
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,440
new semantics which are not covered

289
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,440
by by the concept of a 33 39 timestamp

290
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,839
at all so not not a fixed point in time

291
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,839
or at least the time where we can

292
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,760
converge to a fixed point

293
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,440
after a while

294
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,240
so for instance a floating time

295
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,959
which is a time stamp that only becomes

296
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,480
one

297
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,320
when you add local context so it's

298
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,360
not

299
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,959
um interpretable without that context

300
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,279
of course the data structure that this

301
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,800
timestamp is

302
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,600
integrated in that might provide the

303
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,200
context so you can still have full

304
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,720
interoperability

305
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,720
on these time steps but the the

306
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,480
timestamp by itself

307
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,120
um is is quite different from

308
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,279
uh what the 3339

309
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,680
timestamp would be

310
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,600
even if it synthetically looks very

311
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,760
similar

312
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,240
uh the question really is

313
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,120
um

314
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,800
should we be doing modifications and uh

315
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,560
completely new semantics so that the

316
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,320
points b and c

317
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,200
on the

318
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,519
previous slides in this working group or

319
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,200
not i'm not talking about what the

320
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,600
charter says about that i can read the

321
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,720
charter

322
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,959
but should we do that

323
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,600
uh so is that something that that is

324
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,839
better done in the context with the

325
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,600
other extensions that are covered by a

326
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,480
and

327
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,920
of course

328
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,399
once we do this one interesting question

329
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,320
is should this still look like a 3339

330
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,480
extension or maybe

331
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,680
should it

332
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,959
prevent

333
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,000
false intervality by by looking

334
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,120
sufficiently different that a 3339

335
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,600
implementation is not going to

336
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,519
misunderstand it for

337
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,360
33.39

338
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,639
um

339
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,480
timestamp

340
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,639
so the argument for

341
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,639
my argument i would use for for doing

342
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,320
one and two is that

343
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,519
we could make sure that these modified

344
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,680
or new semantics

345
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,920
could actually mesh very well with what

346
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,680
we already chartered to do which is a

347
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,279
and yeah just uh to to to remind people

348
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,880
you all have the charters on your

349
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,959
laptops but just in case we need this

350
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,600
for the discussion that sure will start

351
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,639
now

352
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,680
i have put the relevant parts of the

353
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,439
charter on three slides here run

354
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,519
point that i would make with all of this

355
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,120
my life

356
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,959
so the queue is open

357
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,519
uh thanks uh for that introduction

358
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,320
karsten and brian go ahead

359
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,560
yep um so

360
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,560
the only point i would make is that if

361
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,279
the time zone name can override the

362
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,399
offset

363
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,320
then we're already in in the space where

364
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,760
the the time plus offset the the

365
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,519
timestamp or exact point in time is not

366
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,120
fixed in place and as soon as you're

367
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,639
doing that you may as well do all the

368
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,399
floating stuff as well

369
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,920
because at that point

370
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,000
you need to you need to read the context

371
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,920
to resolve exactly the time stamp it

372
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,760
could shift depending on context and

373
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,279
once you once you say it could shift

374
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,440
then we should do all the good shifts

375
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,120
but i'd be happy to also to find

376
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,399
something that doesn't allow the

377
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,320
timezone name to override

378
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,079
the time point if that's what we want to

379
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:54,880
do

380
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
but yeah that one one or the other i

381
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,839
think not half and half

382
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,600
okay neil

383
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,000
um i just wanted to say yeah the the

384
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,199
thing is that some of these things are

385
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,440
just not time stamps they're just date

386
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,600
times um but that's

387
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,120
fine there's

388
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,519
a lot of applications on the web that

389
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,480
need date times with the time zone or

390
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,639
date times that's wall clock time that

391
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,000
does have doesn't have any time zone

392
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,360
associated at all

393
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,519
uh and

394
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,279
defining a standard way of serializing

395
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,399
those is good for interoperability and

396
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,199
that's what i thought the temporal group

397
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,720
looking for when they first came to the

398
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
itf with this

399
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,720
proposal um so

400
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,680
i would

401
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,680
say it's fine for it you know

402
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,639
to to not be the same as 3339 we just

403
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,000
don't say it's an extension that we say

404
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,160
it's a separate thing it's just

405
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,040
adding

406
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,199
more uh standard serializations for

407
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,800
common things on the internet just like

408
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,758
3339 did

409
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,519
thanks for watching

410
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,720
lad cloudflare uh

411
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,399
so i would

412
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,079
argue for b1 over b and the reason being

413
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,240
that if you don't know

414
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,079
if you don't see the offset you don't

415
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,480
know how to understand the time zone

416
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,079
an implementation will realize it

417
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,079
doesn't have an offset

418
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,639
but if we have the

419
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,440
the time zone override the offset in

420
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,360
cases where those differ

421
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
the implementation that understands the

422
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,880
time zone will

423
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,800
represent we'll think it's a different

424
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,759
time

425
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,800
than the one that's actually specified

426
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,279
and that would be unfortunate

427
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,800
especially in cases where like there's

428
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,600
user entry that can happen

429
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,440
um

430
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
i do want to say though that does but

431
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,120
also time zones

432
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,279
time zones

433
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,480
since 1970 more or less

434
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,000
are not going to change retroactively

435
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,359
so if you have a past time let's say in

436
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,559
europe berlin just as an example

437
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,640
the the offset for that time is known

438
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,880
and it's not going to shift although

439
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,559
future times this whole question about

440
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,240
how do you know what time it will be in

441
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,240
the future where you don't

442
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,919
um but that's not

443
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,160
not really a concern that's that's more

444
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,840
calendaring things

445
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,559
yeah i think the the observation about

446
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,679
b

447
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,360
b or b1

448
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,240
is that the time zone info database

449
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,840
content is going to change over

450
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,000
time so the interpretation of that

451
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,320
date time timestamp whatever

452
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,919
is going to change

453
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,720
but as you say it's very unlikely to

454
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,799
change retroactively now

455
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,559
so the interpretation is going to

456
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,320
converge

457
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,000
into something

458
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,039
um at least uh well a small time after

459
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,480
the

460
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,480
timestamp actually happened

461
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,240
so that's still different from a

462
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,039
floating time with which is entirely

463
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,720
unfixed

464
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,600
uh i just want to say the

465
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,840
the semantics are entirely different if

466
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,240
i am living in berlin and i write down

467
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,520
that it is 1pm berlin time

468
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,080
then it is 1 pm berlin time and whether

469
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,880
or not the off you know 20 years later

470
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,000
people are confused about what the

471
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,880
offset was the time i wrote down

472
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,039
is the same

473
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,000
so

474
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,400
saying that you know you can't have the

475
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,640
two

476
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,640
if you actually want to have an

477
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,679
unambiguous utc thing set your clock to

478
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,679
utc and keep your timestamp in utc

479
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,679
you shouldn't have a time zone if you

480
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,320
want your timestamp to be a utc one

481
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,919
uncertainty about offsets looking back

482
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,480
is an intended result of putting in a

483
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,720
time zone

484
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,440
um i think brawn next in the queue

485
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,120
or out of the queue maybe i'll go to

486
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,600
ujjwal

487
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,960
hello am i audible

488
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,080
yes

489
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,840
okay perfect uh i just wanted to first

490
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,320
quickly uh plus one the the point that

491
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,520
was just raised like by watson i i think

492
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,559
you know the the core distinction

493
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,320
can't hear you

494
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,600
maybe i will let you resolve any

495
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,520
audio problems you have i couldn't i can

496
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,880
hear him you can hear him

497
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,960
[Music]

498
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,360
that's weird

499
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,719
maybe yeah

500
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,360
um maybe mark you could try refreshing

501
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,760
or something like that

502
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,320
oh or he cannot hear me he can't hear

503
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,159
you mark you might need to refresh your

504
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,440
audio let me ping him

505
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,280
okay uh can i continue yeah

506
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,039
okay uh i was saying that one of the

507
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,679
sort of promises that we make uh

508
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,840
in in the

509
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,240
uh in the rc or sort of tentative rc uh

510
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,720
is that uh

511
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,480
the implementations that don't

512
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,280
understand any or all extensions would

513
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,440
still resolve the time

514
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,240
uh

515
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,480
you know exactly the same way it would

516
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,200
just uh you know have have difficulty

517
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,280
with other operations and i think that

518
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,039
promise is somewhat broken

519
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,400
if you

520
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,320
if you allow b

521
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,360
but

522
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,280
yeah b1

523
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,640
sort of doesn't have that so so it ties

524
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,679
back into the point carsten made about

525
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,720
yeah do we want them to even

526
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,039
be interoperable with 339 maybe it's uh

527
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,679
you know it's it's not good if they

528
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,039
if you want something else maybe it

529
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,200
should look different so that there's

530
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,600
there's no way that there's a mismatch

531
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,320
or something like that

532
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
yeah i still might want to share code so

533
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,919
so some similarity is probably

534
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,919
useful

535
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,720
michael

536
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,000
oh um

537
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,960
yeah i just i just

538
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,400
wondrous emphasis

539
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,919
on

540
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,000
on times just being in the past is is is

541
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,400
misplaced i mean

542
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,799
people are going to publish future times

543
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,120
which are prone to having the um

544
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,120
that the time zone rules change

545
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,880
more than people think i believe

546
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,400
and when you track

547
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,679
time zone

548
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,720
in certain areas the the world time zone

549
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,400
specifications change quite a bit and

550
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,280
at the last minute

551
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,000
so

552
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,320
um

553
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,080
i don't know you can guarantee that any

554
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,600
offset you've put in there is going to

555
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,559
be valid when when you actually come to

556
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,520
the actual point in time

557
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,039
it may be more

558
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,159
true that

559
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,080
they don't change in retrospect but

560
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,080
that's

561
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,440
i don't think we're dealing with that

562
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,840
all the time

563
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,640
let's see

564
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,320
watson again

565
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,400
i think it's important to understand

566
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,640
what people mean when they specify

567
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,120
future times if i say i'm going to meet

568
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,280
you at 12 p.m

569
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,480
or grand central i mean when the hand of

570
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,120
the talk in grand central station both

571
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,840
of them are pointing straight up

572
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,360
and whether or not that is a certain

573
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,840
offset from utc

574
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,640
isn't really the problem

575
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,039
and so a few you know

576
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,679
now what the issue is what happens if

577
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,600
you're specifying

578
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,360
this for a region that that that

579
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,960
suddenly changes the way it keeps its

580
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,000
clock

581
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,679
and that's a very thorny problem because

582
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:32,799
required

583
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,360
wait a minute though

584
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,159
before we go too far down down that road

585
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,200
yo i i i get your point if you happen to

586
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,279
if it was real meetings real people in

587
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,760
the same time zone the problems occur

588
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,760
when you're trying to set up

589
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,120
a uh

590
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,440
a meeting that cro that's in different

591
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,200
time zones

592
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,960
but what time zone do you want your

593
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,159
meeting to be specified in

594
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,840
you you each want your time to be your

595
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,640
time zone what you agree on what the

596
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,799
contract you make is to meet at the same

597
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,520
instant in time which can be ultimately

598
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,320
expressed as utc there's a correct

599
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,760
there's a thing you said which is

600
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,279
absolutely correct what matters to

601
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,720
people

602
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,400
more than anything else what is the

603
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,799
invariant to people is their local time

604
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,400
not utc

605
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,480
so when you say you want a meeting

606
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,120
at at midday or 2 p.m you mean midday or

607
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,080
2pm local time your time but if you're

608
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,279
meeting with somebody in a different

609
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,559
time zone they are meeting at say 8 a.m

610
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,559
in the morning

611
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,799
now right

612
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,440
for you to meet so utc

613
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,320
we are all pretty familiar with that

614
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,360
problem

615
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,720
so

616
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,679
i think yes

617
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,080
that that problem exists

618
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,400
the the question really is what is this

619
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,120
working group trying to do about

620
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,559
i it

621
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,559
i understand that but expressing say

622
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,159
these times as utc or a fixed offset

623
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,159
doesn't resolve those problems because

624
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,960
if the rules change then the utc has to

625
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,799
change

626
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,320
yes i think everybody in this game is

627
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
aware

628
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,600
i i think i think there's i don't think

629
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,440
saying that you're going to have local i

630
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,760
think that prom is inherently insoluble

631
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,720
you don't know whether next year

632
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,840
you know let's say it's a meeting

633
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,640
between say someone in arizona

634
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,039
and or in someone in california you

635
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,960
don't know whether next year one of them

636
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,360
changes time zones

637
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,600
and or it changes the data which the

638
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,520
thing happens so

639
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,840
something has to shift

640
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,640
yep and it's the offset

641
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,279
yeah when you schedule an event

642
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,679
which is why i say the offset is the

643
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,559
wrong thing for future times

644
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,840
i completely agree with that

645
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,440
now there's a use for having the offset

646
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,520
and the timezone id in that you can

647
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,799
detect

648
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,120
that they no longer agree and then you

649
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,400
can actually do something about it and

650
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,840
what you have to do about it is you

651
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,400
can't just automatically fix it you have

652
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,919
to reschedule those things

653
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,080
yeah i think we really have determined

654
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,039
that this use case exists

655
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,360
let me just put out the other use case

656
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,960
so so why

657
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,279
maybe you understand why this is not

658
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,440
quite as simple the other use case is

659
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,120
that i have a certificate i want to be

660
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
able to say when that certificate runs

661
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,480
out

662
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,840
and

663
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,039
there it's

664
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,200
usually not useful to factor in

665
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,840
decisions of politicians but you want to

666
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,360
have an absolute time when that goes

667
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,240
away

668
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,640
so you know when you have to install the

669
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,880
new one instead of it

670
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,440
and i think people are pretty pretty

671
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,760
adamant that the times they put into

672
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,600
certificates

673
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,320
actually mean something very specific so

674
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,880
both use cases exist

675
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,840
rfc 3339 is kind of leaning

676
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,080
towards the the let's have an actual

677
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,480
point in time

678
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,039
so that that's the problem itself today

679
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,520
and what we are trying to to find out

680
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,640
here is

681
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,679
uh what are the the additions we can

682
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,480
make and where do we make them

683
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,399
and what we probably don't need to

684
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,559
discuss is whether the problem exists i

685
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,240
think we are all the way out there

686
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,200
apologies i claim to be back

687
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,120
um

688
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,720
and i don't know who's next in the queue

689
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,200
here is it michael

690
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,279
i think most of what i wanted to say is

691
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,240
uh

692
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,480
is is redundant with what you just

693
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,760
mentioned but yeah i just wanted to

694
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,840
point out that we already have agreement

695
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,200
that both

696
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,360
uh use cases are legitimate for

697
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,080
different applications it's just that

698
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,640
we already have a way to to represent a

699
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,360
instant in time if we know exactly

700
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,120
uh you know when the certificate expires

701
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,440
we can already represent that

702
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,159
in a format right but we but we have no

703
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,840
way to represent

704
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,360
let's meet 9am in in melbourne time like

705
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,640
that's not

706
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,240
something that you can do in the

707
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,399
standard space right now and so the

708
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,880
question is not as much as

709
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,679
uh

710
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,480
is is this even useful but

711
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,760
you know like

712
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,240
do we want to do this and if yes where

713
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,039
should we do it

714
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,640
yeah it may be useful to point out that

715
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,720
there are other standards that already

716
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,640
provide that so somebody cited the

717
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,840
icalendar

718
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,360
standard on the mailing list so that

719
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,039
that provides a way to to have a

720
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,240
future

721
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,200
time

722
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,520
in in the sense that that b that's

723
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,000
called b here

724
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,799
yeah so i think we've we've gone around

725
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,120
in circles enough on this to say that we

726
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,720
should

727
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,640
i guess decide whether we want to work

728
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,640
on it or not that's really the question

729
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,600
ahead of us is should should we do that

730
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,480
this question one here should we

731
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,559
do a

732
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,120
time that is not an exact point in time

733
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,640
format

734
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,480
in this working group and i don't know

735
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,279
if we need to do

736
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,440
a poll for that

737
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,880
to decide

738
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,440
um our charter doesn't specifically

739
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,000
allow us to do it though we could

740
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,840
we could do it by not

741
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,360
by basically doing the options that i

742
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,440
proposed which are and not

743
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,880
making any changes to rfc 339 bit but

744
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,039
having things that could

745
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,360
add an additional offset to it basically

746
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,600
that gets calculated by

747
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
the time zone rules changing or by

748
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,399
whatever by floating which says resolve

749
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,320
it in your current context whatever that

750
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,960
happens to be

751
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,320
so what do you what do you think mark

752
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,480
should we do a

753
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,799
poll on this or should we just ask

754
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,559
people to speak on it i'm aware we're

755
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,720
already halfway through our time slot

756
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,080
yeah we're halfway through um

757
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,039
um i'm puzzled maybe a poll let's see

758
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,279
here

759
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
a poll would be

760
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,159
although i think the important point is

761
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,200
that if we want to do one two we need to

762
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,399
initiate a recharge process quickly

763
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,440
and we need to be very certain

764
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,679
what the scope what extent of that

765
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,840
recharge ring is going to be do we

766
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,320
actually include c for instance or is a

767
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,440
c out of scope and we only do b

768
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,679
um i think that's something that we

769
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,159
should be deciding pretty soon

770
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,279
all of this doesn't have to stop us from

771
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,840
doing a and actually even maybe

772
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,360
finishing and publishing

773
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,399
an rfc that does a

774
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,799
but i think people are so interested in

775
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,240
this other

776
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,159
use case that we need to develop a

777
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,760
position on it even though it's not in

778
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,240
our chart

779
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,039
so i think scoping would be extremely

780
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,399
important if we rechartered um

781
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,840
especially

782
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,440
in in

783
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,360
it'd be very important to make sure that

784
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,600
we are explicit about what is out of

785
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,559
scope

786
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,039
um that's just one person's opinion and

787
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,840
that's without my chair add-on i think

788
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,159
the scoping conversation

789
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,240
while you say would need to happen very

790
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,279
quickly and i agree with that i think

791
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,840
what will be very important is how

792
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,640
how the scope is limited right

793
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,840
uh so

794
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,120
i don't know braun do you have any

795
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,600
thoughts about that

796
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,559
i mean

797
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,159
we would basically

798
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,880
have to say that we we're

799
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,799
creating it the same extension for both

800
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:09,679
a

801
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,679
a point in time and

802
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,559
a

803
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,840
floating date time

804
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,080
um and that the floating date time is

805
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,919
not replacing three three three nine

806
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,159
it's but it can be used with the same

807
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,240
same contextual extensions that can be

808
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,480
used to resolve it

809
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,399
the problem is that this is

810
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,399
this is taking even longer and temporal

811
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,840
is is

812
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,120
already

813
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,559
we promised somebody would try and get

814
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,840
something so that they could actually

815
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,000
bake this stuff into web browsers so

816
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,159
yeah

817
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,399
i think what you should speak i was

818
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,159
actually just asking

819
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,799
uh carsten how how much this would delay

820
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,679
us

821
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,519
uh i i

822
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,279
as you pointed out we're we've been

823
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,760
working on temple and we

824
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,720
would like to be shipping out soon and i

825
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,080
i think it would be really sad if we

826
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,840
uh if we have to ship something that's

827
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,440
not standardized i would not prefer that

828
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,240
at all uh so

829
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,039
uh we we should try at least as much as

830
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,720
we can to

831
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,440
to

832
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,360
to take the fastest route

833
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,840
one thing that i was thinking

834
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,080
is that if if recharging

835
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,880
is

836
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,919
is going to take a substantially

837
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,720
long time one thing we could do is that

838
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,279
since a large number of

839
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,480
uh

840
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,640
you know these these different

841
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,679
derived formats so to say are uh you

842
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,720
know useful

843
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,640
mostly in the calendaring space

844
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,840
we could do that sort of reification uh

845
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,960
in

846
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,159
uh in in calyx and then

847
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,279
change the

848
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,399
uh draft that we have here to to not

849
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,360
only

850
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,720
uh you know

851
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,240
like link two to 359 but also to that

852
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,039
and say okay this can extend

853
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,440
all of these formats not just the the

854
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,519
timestamp format what do people think of

855
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,320
that

856
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,320
proposal

857
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,280
so maybe this is the time for for our

858
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,040
esteemed ad francesca to say a few words

859
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,399
sorry for putting you on the spot

860
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,320
no worries um

861
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,879
i do you have more precise question

862
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,960
because i mean accepted saying that

863
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,480
rechartering would in my opinion not be

864
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,079
quick and um

865
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,040
yeah would take some time especially if

866
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,520
you go to the next slide

867
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,639
i think where you had the charter

868
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,679
was by the one after

869
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,839
um

870
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,679
yeah no i don't know what slide it was

871
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,839
that had the the see the current charter

872
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:50,560
on

873
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,839
uh here you go

874
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:52,960
um

875
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,960
so

876
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,239
um

877
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,400
yeah given this

878
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,560
at the current text and and the effort

879
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,119
that it took to get to this charter

880
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,280
um

881
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,520
yeah i would be uh careful about

882
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,599
like if there are time constraints rich

883
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,920
ordering

884
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,960
might not be the best idea but i'm just

885
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,040
listening in to what everybody's

886
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,839
opinions are

887
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,560
or casting did you want me to

888
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,720
no i think

889
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,200
your estimation for for

890
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,240
how how long a recharging would

891
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,880
uh take is is very important in in this

892
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,200
discussion so if this is something where

893
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,079
if we

894
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,520
came up with a very very specific

895
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,560
scope we could make it happen quickly

896
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,320
that would

897
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,200
make it

898
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,359
push the decision into one direction and

899
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,119
if we find out this is going to be

900
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,720
another rattle

901
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,520
uh it would push us okay so

902
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,880
so from a purely process point of view a

903
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,680
rechartering should take around i

904
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,240
believe something like six weeks if

905
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,880
everything is already in place and this

906
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,800
six weeks should start in the beginning

907
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
of december

908
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,599
at least so

909
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,720
that's at least

910
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,000
two and a half three months

911
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,960
and that's and that's assuming that you

912
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,240
know everybody can agree on on

913
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,359
recharging text and and scope and

914
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,240
uh motivation and evaluation

915
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,560
um

916
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,880
yeah that is also mentioned in the

917
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,839
current charter so that's

918
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,950
important to to do yeah

919
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,760
[Music]

920
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,680
so i would expect us to take about the

921
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,520
same time to to

922
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,280
fix up the documents

923
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,440
of course we couldn't make one document

924
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,920
a working group document before the

925
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,079
recharger is at least in a

926
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,880
definitive stage

927
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,920
um

928
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,000
again the the the other thing we could

929
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,920
do or maybe we can do both at the same

930
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,880
time

931
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,839
is

932
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,280
write up the

933
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,200
case a here

934
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,520
and make sure all the mechanics for

935
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,000
actually defining extensions are already

936
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,359
in there

937
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,400
so we just have to add this this one

938
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,200
little ingredients that we are actually

939
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,320
doing things beyond 3339

940
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,079
at the time when we are chartered to do

941
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,320
that

942
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,640
i think that's an interesting way

943
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,160
forward because one of the things that

944
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,400
we could potentially do here

945
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,880
is immediately start

946
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,839
working on draft text for rechartering

947
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,560
and then also schedule an interim so

948
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,680
that

949
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,400
being sensitive to temporal

950
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,440
uh that we're making we're making clear

951
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,599
and definitive progress right that we're

952
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,680
not waiting we're not waiting until

953
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,599
march to make more progress here

954
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,839
although i think i want to say again

955
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,200
that you know the

956
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,040
the conversation that's gone on the list

957
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,640
in the last five days has been really

958
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,920
constructive

959
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,400
uh i do think having an interim might be

960
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,880
a way of pushing the work forward a

961
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,800
little more quickly and that's something

962
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,480
i'll bring up at the end of the session

963
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,280
but i can actually see um

964
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,839
three parallel tracks there right is

965
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,000
continuing work on the existing document

966
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,119
and putting putting a into it uh working

967
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,000
in a track where we recharter and then

968
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,680
have an individual submission to

969
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,480
actually deal with for instance b1

970
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,839
um

971
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,920
so that we were making we were making

972
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,000
forward progress

973
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,280
in parallel with rechartering

974
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,320
that's that's one approach anyway i

975
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,680
don't know if people have any comments

976
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,640
about that

977
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,440
that strategy

978
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,560
works for me

979
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,320
i guess the other question for

980
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,040
for

981
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,599
the temporal group is

982
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,920
is this useful to you

983
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,359
in this shape without the ability to do

984
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,200
floating time

985
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,280
or the ability to have the zone override

986
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,839
the offset

987
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,760
i i guess i could speak to that the

988
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,560
uh the idea is that uh

989
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,760
temporal

990
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,800
does

991
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
have those semantics

992
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,680
uh

993
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,640
but then because temporal is is in a

994
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,359
special situation where it is a

995
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,480
programming language api so there's more

996
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,040
ways to represent that so so in this

997
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,560
case we

998
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,440
we

999
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,599
of course do not allow the

1000
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,560
uh you know this information of saying

1001
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,160
okay the the

1002
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,560
time zone overrides the

1003
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,359
offset be represented in the interchange

1004
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,520
format but then you know the programmer

1005
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,839
can specify that on their end so

1006
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,480
so it's like still doable

1007
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,280
uh and therefore we we don't need but we

1008
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,640
don't have a pressing need for this

1009
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,160
all right in that case i think

1010
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,520
definitely pushing ahead with this

1011
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,800
document

1012
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,599
with

1013
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,800
timestamps only makes sense

1014
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,240
and also doing the recharging in

1015
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,000
parallel because we can publish this one

1016
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,119
without recharging

1017
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,839
shouldn't i have is that if if he

1018
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:40,079
published this one with with what we

1019
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,440
have right now

1020
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,440
say

1021
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,560
would we need to

1022
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,400
say you know push a

1023
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,440
new version obsoleting this once we

1024
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,079
once we have the the other document

1025
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,720
published so that it says okay it can

1026
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,280
extend both or can we do that in some

1027
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,640
way right now

1028
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,359
by saying okay this this applies to

1029
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,240
uh

1030
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,640
you know any derived formats

1031
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,879
and not just that specific format

1032
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,800
well i wouldn't write it in such a way

1033
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,720
that it has to be obsoleted

1034
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,200
i mean if we have a pretty good idea of

1035
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,960
where where we are going in the next

1036
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,000
step we can make the first step go into

1037
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,920
the right direction

1038
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,440
so it would just be another document

1039
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,319
that is added to it

1040
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,200
and

1041
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,599
that sounds really good

1042
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,000
yeah that sounds really ideal i think

1043
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,400
the the way i hear it it doesn't delay

1044
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,520
the document we have and it allows us to

1045
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,079
to start working on the supplementary

1046
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,640
document right away so i think i really

1047
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,040
like that idea

1048
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,400
so with my chair hat back on i'm hearing

1049
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,800
gradual consensus there i i want to make

1050
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,560
sure that the mic is open for other

1051
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,079
points of view

1052
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,960
but uh there is this uh

1053
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,599
emerging consensus that we continue to

1054
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,520
work on the existing document and move

1055
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,400
it forward as quickly as we can

1056
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,800
in parallel with a uh

1057
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,119
a rechartering pro process that is uh

1058
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,400
has a very brisk uh scoping

1059
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,800
and then also the beginnings of a

1060
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,440
beginnings of the new document for

1061
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,240
uh

1062
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,839
like i said b and b one here b or b

1063
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:31,920
one so it's it's basically three

1064
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,839
parallel tracks that the working group

1065
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,000
would proceed on

1066
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,599
let me just leave the mic open here and

1067
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,319
see if there's anyone else that wants to

1068
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,680
talk to that planned path forward

1069
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,800
i will say editorially

1070
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,119
what's nice about that is that continues

1071
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,160
uh

1072
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,480
continues to get us towards a work

1073
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,880
product relatively quickly

1074
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,520
it really addresses the issues that have

1075
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,280
come up in the last five days i like

1076
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,720
that a lot

1077
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,880
and

1078
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,720
and i'm not afraid of the rechartering

1079
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,760
process i think that

1080
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,119
work can be done after ietf112 to move

1081
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,359
move reasonably quickly on that

1082
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,520
although everything that francesca says

1083
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,680
about the recharging process is true all

1084
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,400
the

1085
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,560
process that it has to go through so let

1086
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,480
me just pause here and see if anyone

1087
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,760
else wants to

1088
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,240
come to the queue

1089
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,200
wow i see no one okay

1090
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,640
so i'm going to assume that we have

1091
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,119
consensus on that path forward

1092
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,560
and that someone has very bravely

1093
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,599
made a note of what we've decided

1094
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,560
uh

1095
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,160
let me just make it karsten you're okay

1096
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,319
with that as a way forward

1097
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,680
yeah i think

1098
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,839
we have lots in place that can make

1099
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,560
us generate a document for a

1100
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,280
and we should simply do that and this

1101
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,160
allows us to get for instance the syntax

1102
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,240
issues out of the way

1103
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,440
before we

1104
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,520
actually go into the semantics issues

1105
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,560
that may

1106
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,400
make b or c a little bit more

1107
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,040
complicated than it seems at the moment

1108
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,800
okay that's fine maybe it was wrong

1109
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,359
that i i wanted to sort of

1110
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,520
ask about from the chat

1111
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,480
is that uh if the

1112
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,319
if publishing this

1113
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,720
document that we have right now is not

1114
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,079
blocked on rechartering or uh

1115
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,560
you know the second document do we have

1116
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,520
a pressing reason to to do anything

1117
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,800
very quickly

1118
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,800
uh because

1119
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,000
i i think temple can ship after we we

1120
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,280
have this one

1121
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,640
published right so

1122
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,880
so my understanding of

1123
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,720
my understanding here is that we would

1124
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,000
move quickly on the existing document

1125
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,160
and we have a

1126
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,119
in the charter we have a

1127
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,280
timeline that suggests that we would get

1128
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,319
a

1129
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,359
document to the iesg by december

1130
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,599
i think that is aspirational at this

1131
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,760
point but that's a conversation that i

1132
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,440
want to save time to have here at the

1133
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,040
end of our session

1134
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,359
um i and the reason that i keep

1135
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,240
stressing uh parallel development here

1136
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,400
is because i am sensitive

1137
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,000
to uh

1138
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,040
temporals timelines and i'm also

1139
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,640
sensitive to the fact that when we were

1140
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,640
chartered as a working group we were

1141
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,720
chartered as a short-lived working group

1142
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,280
we don't want to i i and i don't want to

1143
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,359
put words in francesca's mouth but we

1144
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:40,960
don't want to be in a situation where

1145
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,760
we're

1146
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,520
sort of like barnacles on the side of a

1147
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,000
boat sort of adding to the charter over

1148
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,440
time right we want a clear and fairly

1149
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,280
succinct scope

1150
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,160
um that would be my answer to your

1151
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,920
to your point

1152
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,920
i had um i think i have john next in the

1153
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,920
queue

1154
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,000
mark i just wanted to make a quick

1155
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,680
procedural observation about something

1156
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,160
you said

1157
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,319
which is that especially given some of

1158
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,400
the people who are not participating

1159
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,240
in this session possibly because of

1160
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,520
conflicts with other working groups

1161
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,480
um

1162
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,079
uh we don't have consensus on anything

1163
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,680
that was confirmed on the mailing list

1164
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,960
so john um i completely agree with i was

1165
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,200
simply talking about concession in

1166
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,119
consensus in the session and we would

1167
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,400
obviously

1168
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,480
take back any discussions that we had in

1169
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,000
the working group meeting back to the

1170
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,839
mailing list for

1171
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,400
a consensus call i i completely agree

1172
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,560
with you i i just wanted to make certain

1173
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,480
that was clear and i assumed you knew it

1174
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,839
but i want to be sure this could go

1175
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,480
anywhere else yeah let me let me be very

1176
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,079
clear about my intention and the reason

1177
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,240
that i was hoping that braun was making

1178
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,880
a note there is that if we have a clear

1179
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,119
and succinct understanding of what the

1180
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,280
proposed pathway forward is

1181
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,200
that i would take the responsibility of

1182
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,640
getting that out to the mailing list in

1183
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,599
short order and asking for discussion

1184
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,440
and potentially consensus around that

1185
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,800
path forward

1186
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,440
again john knowing that um

1187
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,119
i'd like to drive that consensus as

1188
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,079
quickly as i can

1189
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,119
i i hope we're all in favor of that and

1190
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,760
thanks very much

1191
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,640
cool we have 13 minutes left to uh

1192
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,559
address all the rest of these slides so

1193
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,839
we probably should keep moving

1194
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,079
yeah i think the the the interim is

1195
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,420
really needed

1196
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,720
[Music]

1197
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,440
um so the the my hope would be that we

1198
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,760
actually can get the the document in a

1199
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,160
state where where it actually

1200
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,400
shows that this working group can

1201
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,720
get things done at the time the the

1202
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,480
final decision about reset the recharge

1203
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,359
ring

1204
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,920
needs to be done so this is an incentive

1205
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,760
another incentive to do this quickly

1206
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,920
so should i go to the other slides

1207
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,280
please there

1208
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,160
okay

1209
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,440
so um i think we have five areas uh

1210
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,800
where we need to get work done and

1211
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,280
the first of all is uh of course the

1212
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,440
overall format

1213
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,240
um so we already had some discussion

1214
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,800
about ascii this is utf-8 i don't want

1215
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,800
to open that discussion right now i just

1216
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,960
want to remind people that we have to

1217
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,880
have an opinion on that

1218
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,160
maybe more important is that we need to

1219
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,640
explain what it means to receive an

1220
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,240
extension you don't understand

1221
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,280
so if all extensions are annotations

1222
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,280
that actually simple

1223
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,440
once they actually modify the the

1224
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,200
meaning that becomes a little bit more

1225
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,760
complicated

1226
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,079
an annotation may be something that you

1227
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,480
really want the recipient to understand

1228
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,839
before

1229
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,599
using the time so um yeah in many other

1230
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,359
protocols we have something like must

1231
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,400
understand flags or something like that

1232
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,079
so i think that that's an area where we

1233
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,640
need to understand what what we

1234
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,240
need to do or what we want to do here

1235
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,119
um yeah and finally the thing really

1236
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,040
needs a name

1237
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,720
could somebody please invent a name for

1238
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,240
this

1239
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:18,620
um

1240
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,000
[Music]

1241
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,599
any comments on the quick comments on

1242
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,839
this

1243
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,240
okay

1244
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,880
um yeah the time zone extension i think

1245
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,720
is is uh

1246
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,200
pretty clear what what that is in

1247
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,839
particular if it's uh just an annotation

1248
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,640
then i think we we understand that so so

1249
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:44,480
issue number three is is already

1250
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,400
answered by the discussion

1251
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,119
uh we already had and may we have to

1252
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,359
spend a little bit of time thinking

1253
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,599
about forward compatibility

1254
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,040
uh issues

1255
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,920
uh here so what what do you do with the

1256
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,839
time zone names that actually are

1257
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:02,079
deleted from the database

1258
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,599
and so on

1259
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,760
but i think apart from that this this is

1260
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,000
uh this should be a slander

1261
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,880
now the the next question is naming the

1262
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,760
other extensions and the the current

1263
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,000
draft has a pretty complicated

1264
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,880
mechanism so you don't name any other

1265
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,079
extensions

1266
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,280
you first of all delegate namespaces to

1267
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,160
different organizations that then

1268
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,720
run registries for extensions within

1269
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,680
that organization

1270
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,440
sounds complicated

1271
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:39,740
there's also a

1272
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:40,880
[Music]

1273
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,680
consideration that uh names usually

1274
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,400
start out as somebody

1275
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,240
making an experiment and then this

1276
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,640
experiment grows and so on and if we

1277
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,520
have

1278
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,720
names that that try to reveal that this

1279
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,559
is experimental stuff

1280
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,720
uh the the x dash

1281
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,280
uh will continue to be in that name you

1282
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,960
will never get rid of it again so i

1283
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,760
think we have to think about how we run

1284
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,280
these registries

1285
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,480
a little bit

1286
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,119
more but my proposal would be to get rid

1287
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,280
of the whole delegation thing

1288
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,280
because that leads to a complicated

1289
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,720
mechanism of making another organization

1290
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,960
act in a way that this

1291
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,200
document describes

1292
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,760
and i think we can just skip all that

1293
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,800
and and create a single registry

1294
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,599
and make it reasonably easy to actually

1295
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,000
register something there or maybe

1296
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,319
reasonably hard if we want to but we

1297
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,800
have to decide on what's the

1298
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,200
threshold we want to uh put in there

1299
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,400
there is a concept of a single character

1300
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,119
namespace which is currently only

1301
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,640
provided for the unicode consortium

1302
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,440
and

1303
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,680
the text seems to imply

1304
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,359
that a single

1305
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,400
that any unicode

1306
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,280
specification automatically can define

1307
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,160
or automatically already defines an

1308
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,839
extension mechanism

1309
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,920
for the timestamp and i'm not sure that

1310
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,920
actually works

1311
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,280
so the the u-dash ca that is given as an

1312
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,800
example here

1313
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,079
that doesn't really tell me enough to to

1314
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,359
write software to handle this

1315
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,559
so again my proposal would be to

1316
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,280
just get rid of this

1317
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,440
make sure that we have a good way to

1318
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,280
take in

1319
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,680
extensions from from

1320
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,000
the unicode consortium

1321
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,720
maybe require them to spec them out in a

1322
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,079
way that they actually are usable

1323
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,280
in the

1324
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,480
extended format we define

1325
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,240
and yeah let's the

1326
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,359
last slide here is about the

1327
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,200
multi-character

1328
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,960
namespaces

1329
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,200
i already said this this is more complex

1330
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,119
than it

1331
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,520
needs to be we could still reserve

1332
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,440
extension name prefixes so if we say

1333
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,960
u-dash

1334
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,119
goes to unicode

1335
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,359
that's probably a simple thing to add to

1336
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:12,839
this

1337
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,520
registry but apart from that just having

1338
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,480
a registry for

1339
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,280
information elements that that could be

1340
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,559
added by

1341
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,079
an organization that writes a

1342
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,920
specification which includes the itf

1343
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,280
itself of course

1344
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,960
sounds much simpler than what we have

1345
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,200
now

1346
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,598
comments

1347
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,760
okay which walk around

1348
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,240
i think that i was sort of clarifying on

1349
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,119
the on the chat was

1350
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:50,640
that the

1351
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,000
the whole

1352
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,640
procedure that that i have seems rather

1353
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,720
convoluted in hindsight it was something

1354
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,119
that i borrowed from bcp-47

1355
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:01,520
so i don't feel strongly in favor of it

1356
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,920
or anything and i'd be happy

1357
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,119
to

1358
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,640
to to take in any uh simplifications

1359
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:14,720
okay that's helpful

1360
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,160
i go ahead and comment in the chat about

1361
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,559
vanity registrations and so on

1362
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,400
um so i think it's pretty clear that we

1363
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,960
have to have an expert review

1364
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,160
type mechanism here and the the

1365
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,079
job the poor designated expert would

1366
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,079
have to do is fend off

1367
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,720
uh vanity registrations

1368
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,799
um so i think that that's standard

1369
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,119
material and and we know how to do that

1370
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:39,920
and

1371
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,079
i don't think this is particularly more

1372
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,240
attractive than other

1373
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,839
targets

1374
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:48,079
for people i'm not going to talk about

1375
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:49,920
one particular person who has been very

1376
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,160
visible

1377
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,200
so

1378
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,920
i think we can handle that

1379
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,319
yeah and i would say that

1380
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,079
my experience with ayanna is they have a

1381
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,559
lot of experience in this area

1382
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,680
defending against vanity registrations

1383
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,799
uh john in the queue

1384
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:14,559
i'm going to respectfully disagree diana

1385
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,880
has had problems with that kind of thing

1386
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,520
since pastel handed over control to a

1387
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,799
committee

1388
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:24,160
uh and uh and they resist

1389
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,359
things where they're forced to make

1390
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,760
those kinds of decisions and designated

1391
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,839
experts do not work with this country

1392
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:31,680
where the serious controversy is

1393
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,119
distinct from

1394
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,520
uh trying to make things

1395
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,559
um

1396
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,160
consistent with the setting norms about

1397
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,799
how they're described and this meeting

1398
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,880
conflicting with the media type

1399
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,960
one is a real disaster in stanford

1400
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,760
heaviest discussion

1401
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,040
i i i would expect that if

1402
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,480
um

1403
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,640
if you said designated experts going to

1404
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,799
make these kinds of decisions among

1405
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,480
competing entities who are interested in

1406
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,319
registering names

1407
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,280
that um uh that you would get resistance

1408
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,920
miami and you would probably if they're

1409
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,799
on their 12th get resistance to isg

1410
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:09,839
um

1411
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:10,880
this this

1412
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,720
this is a tough problem

1413
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,720
now i agree the designated expert ought

1414
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,880
to be able to project nonsense if i

1415
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,799
decide i want to register a thing called

1416
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,799
john which is time so wherever i haven't

1417
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,799
been standing at the moment i would hope

1418
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,160
a designated expert would be able to

1419
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,480
beat me when i had enough to discourage

1420
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,880
that registration attempt

1421
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,359
but uh but if you get two legitimate

1422
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,599
attempts to register the same string

1423
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,839
with different semantics the system is

1424
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,880
not going to deal with that

1425
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,240
well at least you will make sure that

1426
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,319
only one of these registrations goes

1427
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,720
goes through

1428
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,880
well then the traditional solution to

1429
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,559
that it's going to first come first

1430
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:49,839
serve and that raises its own set of

1431
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,119
problems

1432
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,559
no

1433
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,480
this is not a candidate for comfort

1434
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,599
serve um no it's not absolutely

1435
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,400
yeah

1436
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,640
um

1437
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,040
let me see here i want i do uh i know we

1438
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,559
have four minutes left and i do want to

1439
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:07,280
reserve a couple minutes to talk about

1440
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,960
future actions here

1441
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,480
um and i i understand uh john's point

1442
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,640
and respectfully disagree in some cases

1443
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,520
here um

1444
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,040
other uh

1445
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,960
let me just leave the queue open one

1446
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,400
last time for

1447
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,240
any further comments about carsten's

1448
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,890
last five slides here

1449
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:29,259
[Music]

1450
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,160
okay

1451
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,960
what i'd like to do then is chair

1452
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,720
is summarize what i've heard

1453
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,599
and

1454
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,240
just get a thumbs up from braun that

1455
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,000
this is the way forward

1456
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,520
so what we're going to do is take to the

1457
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,079
mailing list commitment to move continue

1458
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,359
to move forward

1459
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,760
on the existing working group document

1460
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,240
and try to do that at pace

1461
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,599
the second thing is we're going to

1462
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:01,599
have a conversation on the mailing list

1463
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,359
about

1464
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:06,160
rechartering and potentially

1465
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,079
asking someone to do an individual

1466
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:09,839
submission that meets

1467
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,440
additional requirements that have been

1468
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,680
identified both in this meeting and in

1469
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,359
the last five days

1470
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:18,079
so that we have a path that has three

1471
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:19,119
tracks

1472
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:20,640
one is the existing document and

1473
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,200
continuing to make progress on it

1474
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,839
and then two other uh things uh a

1475
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,599
working group recharter

1476
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,400
and also another document

1477
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,319
um

1478
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:35,920
i note uh and as as chair this is

1479
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,920
something that concerns me

1480
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,920
and braun as well that we have in our uh

1481
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,640
in the charter for our timeline we have

1482
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,520
a

1483
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,000
deadline of delivering uh our first

1484
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,280
document to the iesg in december

1485
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,839
and what i'd like to do now is sort of

1486
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:56,160
have a reality check about

1487
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,119
getting that done in december

1488
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,839
and see if anyone has any comments about

1489
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,680
whether that's doable or we should

1490
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,720
revise that date

1491
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,119
well we need two weeks for the regular

1492
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,760
school we need one week for

1493
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,640
thanksgiving we need one week for

1494
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,440
uh the holidays uh and so on and we

1495
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,880
probably need a couple of weeks to

1496
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,000
actually do the work so that that's a

1497
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,680
pretty aspiration i would say

1498
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,240
yeah i i'm tempted to say the same thing

1499
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,479
um

1500
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:46,960
how

1501
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,880
that was going to be exactly my

1502
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,720
my contribution

1503
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,200
if we make it february of next year

1504
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,559
one of the things a working group could

1505
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,839
decide to do is have an interim in

1506
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:01,839
january to sort of clean up and and

1507
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:03,760
truly finish the document

1508
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,720
prior to working group last call

1509
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,760
and so

1510
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,920
i like the idea of february of next year

1511
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,839
let me see uh if there's anyone that

1512
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:14,079
wants to get in the queue to talk about

1513
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,720
that change

1514
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,960
okay like the others that's something

1515
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,640
that i will take back to the mailing

1516
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,319
list and propose

1517
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:26,000
as a change

1518
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,400
the last thing that's on my agenda then

1519
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,400
and i know i'm at time here

1520
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,119
is how do people feel about

1521
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,400
the chairs or

1522
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:39,079
organizing an interim meeting in january

1523
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,079
i can reply to that i would actually

1524
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,400
have one in december

1525
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,640
and one in january but

1526
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,319
that's maybe just my kind of working

1527
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,359
would you also in the queue

1528
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:03,599
go ahead

1529
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,599
that i i was wondering if you could do

1530
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:08,839
one sooner

1531
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:11,920
um

1532
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,160
well let me do this uh let me talk to

1533
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,760
braun offline

1534
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,440
about the timing of that

1535
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,480
and if uh if he and i can make it work

1536
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,880
uh we'll try to have one in december

1537
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,440
what i would propose is that if we do

1538
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,440
one in december then and that at that

1539
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,599
december meeting we would decide whether

1540
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,920
or not we need another one in january

1541
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,160
rather than scheduling both of them i

1542
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,240
think it should be on an as needed basis

1543
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,040
while i do agree that in order to make

1544
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,599
um you know quick progress on the

1545
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,680
existing working group document

1546
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,359
i think an interim in december would be

1547
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,599
useful i just want to make sure that we

1548
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:48,960
can get the

1549
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,240
uh the interested people there

1550
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,119
does that seem right to you bro

1551
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:57,200
yeah i think so we'll

1552
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,880
sort out a uh

1553
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,880
some kind of poll and work out when we

1554
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,720
can get the bulk of the bulk of the key

1555
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,559
people there

1556
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:07,280
that sounds like a good path forward

1557
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,880
okay um uh we are at end time here

1558
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,799
uh is there any other issue that someone

1559
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,520
wants to bring up

1560
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,119
well otherwise uh on behalf of the

1561
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:21,280

1562

be posting things to the list probably

1565
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,240
