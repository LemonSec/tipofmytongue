times

68
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,920
participants have impersonal discussion

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,840
participants devise solutions for the

70
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,000
global internet that meet the needs of

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,599
diverse technical and operational

72
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,959
environments

73
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,959
participants are prepared to contribute

74
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,239
to the ongoing work of the group

75
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,120
um

76
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,519
there's some information for

77
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,760
access to the various meeting materials

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,080
it's also available on the

79
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
on the media echo

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,040
video stream

81
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,680
and then the agenda for today is as you

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,840
see here

83
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,640
so

84
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,319
unless there are any

85
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,599
uh comments or requests for his change i

86
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,519
think we're ready to to jump into the

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,519
agenda

88
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,720
so first up will be

89
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,159
a

90
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,599
uh a discussion

91
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,000
regarding overlap between attestation

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,760
results uh e

93
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,480
eat and attestation sets

94
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,360
we've in the previous meeting we have

95
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,239
had

96
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,959
uh presentations on on all of these uh

97
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,159
drafts so

98
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,840
those who are attending the first

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,159
session should be familiar with them

100
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,760
and this uh

101
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,519
session is

102
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,280
intended to have a conversation around

103
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,879
what the overlap is if any and

104
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,400
uh if there's any

105
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,720
uh work that's

106
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,280
that's uh potentially a blocker for any

107
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,478
of these moving forward

108
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,478
so

109
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,280
sorry about that

110
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,840
so let me switch

111
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,600
to

112
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,680
another

113
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,160
window here

114
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,160
it's the very first slide if you thought

115
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,840
i'm thinking about

116
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,919
yeah it's this one

117
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,680
there okay

118
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,639
so uh this i think that this uh eric

119
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,320
slide so maybe eric if you wanted to

120
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,759
just talk to it to kind of get things

121
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,639
started that would be great

122
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,560
sure over the last

123
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
few weeks

124
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,840
the authors of the eat drafts

125
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,080
draft more irt and draftweight have had

126
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,680
a discussion

127
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,120
in the background with the chairs trying

128
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,280
to discuss overlaps between the

129
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,400
documents

130
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,400
for those of you who remember ietf 111

131
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,919
there were

132
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,240
dis requests by both the attestation

133
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,759
results draft and the draft moriarty at

134
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,240
the station sets for working group

135
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,520
adoption

136
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,759
but because there was the potential for

137
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,000
overlaps in the scope of some of the

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,120
documents

139
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
people wanted to do a

140
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,919
review of what the actual overlaps were

141
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,000
or were not

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,759
so we came up with this

143
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,160
cut of a slide that talked about what

144
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,360
overlaps

145
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,000
seemed to exist between the three

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,560
drafts and i do think that we came to a

147
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,800
consensus i'll look for lawrence and

148
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,240
kathleen

149
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,319
to go ahead and confirm

150
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,680
in terms of draft

151
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,360
the eat draft

152
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,039
basically it is defining uh claims

153
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,120
and as you know that has been reviewed

154
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,039
many times and draft moriarty which is a

155
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,600
listing of what sets of evidence that

156
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,759
might be sent from an attester to a

157
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,960
verifier

158
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,720
it seems like it would be good to reuse

159
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
the definitions of claims

160
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,479
from the each draft and that seems to

161
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,960
make sense and it's possible that over

162
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,440
time draft moriarty would also define

163
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,600
new claims because there'd be a need to

164
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,120
understand

165
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,840
other types of evidence in in ways that

166
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,639
are not going to be vendor specific and

167
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,639
that we'd want to go ahead and perhaps

168
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,400
add new claims

169
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,960
to eat over time and it might not go

170
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,800
into this version of the draft but it

171
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,440
might go into future drafts so it didn't

172
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,639
seem like there was a lot of overlap

173
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,319
in that direction

174
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,720
on the bottom side oops i think we have

175
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,280
dave in the queue so any questions on

176
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,800
that particular relationship dave

177
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,720
um

178
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,880
my understanding from the eat spec in

179
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,840
section 1.3.2 of eat spec explicitly

180
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840
says that it's not just for things

181
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,680
coming from the tester it's also for

182
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,160
claims that appear in the attestation

183
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,919
results it's a generic format and the

184
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,560
eat spec currently covers both as far as

185
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,599
its scope

186
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,520
um i believe that's what the document

187
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,039
says right now somebody can correct me

188
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,400
if that's not the intent that is what

189
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,240
the document says right now i'm just

190
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,280
commenting because right now you

191
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,880
classified it as coming from a tester

192
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,960
and it should say from a tester or a

193
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,599
verifier

194
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,160
this is kathleen just to provide a

195
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,840
clarification

196
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,120
um

197
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,560
the main purpose is to be able to define

198
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,039
what a set looks like

199
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,879
right and that's absolutely not covered

200
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,960
in the e draft so just to make sure that

201
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,280
that distinction is very clear this is

202
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,199
really to set up a registry so that

203
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,599
people could define sets

204
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,560
of

205
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,639
local attestations that could be sent

206
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,560
together as a single attestation

207
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,520
remotely for scale

208
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,160
that's the main part

209
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,000
and if we need to reword some things

210
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
that's fine but that's not covered and

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,400
should not be covered in a document like

212
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,680
the the court eat spec because it's

213
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,919
a small piece that is an extension and

214
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,560
can be handled

215
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,080
separately all right so um looking at

216
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,120
the definition of the uh or eat draft as

217
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,200
well as the attestation sets

218
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,039
uh to answer dave's question the

219
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,519
text in the draft in the e-draft does

220
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,479
say that it's uh mostly coming from a

221
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,560
tester then the later section says there

222
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,360
are new attester claims that art might

223
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,959
become from a verifier so i do think

224
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,120
that that's captured in the top block

225
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,640
that there's stuff coming from the

226
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,720
attester as well as from the verifier

227
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,480
and is there any pushback that there are

228
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,880
the overlaps as asserted in the blue

229
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,080
bubbles between those two drafts

230
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,279
all right on the bottom uh relationship

231
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,880
um

232
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,800
as kaplan just talked about at the

233
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,360
station sets is really defining

234
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,000
types and sets of evidence uh in

235
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,640
different uh

236
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,600
sets and then

237
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,760
that doesn't seem to have an overlap

238
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,519
with what the

239
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,880
generated attestation results would be

240
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
from the verifier

241
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,440
so it looks like there's not an overlap

242
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,760
between attestation sets which is what's

243
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,120
being attested

244
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,519
and the attestation results

245
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,160
in terms of the trustworthiness claims

246
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,920
that are coming about the overall

247
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,200
posture of an attester as evaluated by a

248
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,720
verifier

249
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,760
so

250
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,480
the

251
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,959
assertion on the bottom angle here

252
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,440
the bottom two without talking any

253
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,320
relationship with eat is that there's no

254
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,880
obvious overlap in those two giraffes

255
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
and i see lawrence and q

256
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,279
largely have any comments on the bottom

257
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,279
angle or the angle that we talked about

258
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,880
before between eat and attestation sets

259
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,640
yes um

260
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,600
uh

261
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,200
just quickly um

262
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,000
the

263
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,440
the

264
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,079
avoid attestation results discusses

265
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,050
identity claims like hardware identity

266
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,040
[Music]

267
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,600
it doesn't call them claims um

268
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,440
it it just it just discusses that

269
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,519
there's something that that would be a

270
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,480
part of attestation results and it does

271
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,120
define claims for those things

272
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,040
okay we're not yet talking about that

273
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,440
angle yet between the top and the one on

274
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,360
the left we'll get to that one next

275
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,800
okay sorry if i'm off there

276
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,320
any comments on attestation results to

277
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,519
the

278
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,680
uh

279
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,600
the attestation results voip draft in

280
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,519
the morality draft is there any uh

281
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,200
disagreement that there's no overlap

282
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,360
there

283
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
all right so the last

284
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,640
discussion is the one that uh that

285
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,640
lawrence just pointed out is that there

286
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,160
is a draft

287
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,640
and claims in the eat draft on identity

288
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,680
and the draft void attestation results

289
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,880
has

290
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,560
types of identity

291
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,320
that's a

292
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,399
part of the

293
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,959
discussion that is needed for the

294
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,480
use of the attestation results in

295
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,079
secure information interaction model so

296
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,920
there are definitely claims of identity

297
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,279
in the eat

298
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,560
and there's categories of identity types

299
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,360
that are non-normative claims

300
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,959
in draft voip

301
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,480
so in the

302
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,760
left

303
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,399
draft void relationship to draft

304
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,160
rats eat

305
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,959
there are new claims that could be taken

306
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,639
into eat on the attestation results

307
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,760
and

308
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,600
there are identity types in eat that

309
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,560
could be used in embodiments

310
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,600
of the draft attestation results

311
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,040
that would be used for secure

312
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,360
information interaction models

313
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
and that's why on the very left hand

314
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,560
side there's a something that says

315
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,200
subsequent draft embodiments could use

316
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,160
eating coding for things like specific

317
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,839
identity claims

318
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,399
of the types that are identified in

319
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,519
active station results

320
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,600
so hank you're in queue

321
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,519
thank you can't hear you

322
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,800
oh yeah sorry no

323
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,399
when i change the audio sometimes it

324
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,639
skips here on my side sorry uh yeah this

325
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,480
is saying um

326
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,079
i yeah i

327
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,600
i think it's a little bit like like with

328
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,040
the um

329
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,560
attestation sets so uh yes i think that

330
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,600
uh

331
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,560
when we arrive at a maturity level that

332
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,120
we can assess that actually we

333
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,360
can use uh

334
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,440
identity claims from each if they're

335
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,480
applicable

336
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,200
and that's i think the the reason why

337
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,720
each is there so we can reuse generic

338
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,600
claims that are relatively universal

339
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,000
and if we have to

340
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,360
create additional claims these can be in

341
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,079
addition to each later so to speak they

342
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,360
don't have to be in the each core

343
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,240
document i think uh if we arrive at the

344
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
conclusion that there's something that

345
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,839
is definitely this

346
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,000
disjoint uh and still about identity i

347
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,199
think uh

348
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,600
it's a no-brainer to to add

349
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,839
a either in this document

350
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,800
or

351
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,360
a separate document uh next to the

352
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,959
information model that we actually do

353
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,600
here uh some claim definitions so

354
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,000
they're not very far apart and i think

355
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,560
that is not it will be complementary and

356
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,320
not conflicting we just have to make

357
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,440
sure that we reuse everything in each

358
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,360
that can be reused in order not to do

359
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,040
redundant things that would be bad

360
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,639
all right so i think that's a good point

361
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,800
there's lots of documents and lots of

362
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,560
identities out there

363
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
certainly there are other giraffes like

364
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,839
draft chen rats te identification which

365
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,560
also uses identities so there will be a

366
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,320
lot of identities

367
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,560
that can be tested

368
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,519
and

369
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,120
there are some in eat there'll be some

370
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,800
in many other drafts

371
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,760
not all identities are going to come

372
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,279
from a single place they'll come from

373
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,079
many places

374
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,360
all right so

375
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
i think that's what was requested for

376
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,680
the kickoff of the session is what the

377
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,040
kinds of overlaps would be

378
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,680
it doesn't look like there's anything

379
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,519
normative that i see

380
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,279
that would be

381
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,680
a conflict in the existing drafts i'll

382
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,040
let the others

383
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,320
jump in

384
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,880
and assert uh their own thoughts on this

385
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,880
anybody else who wants to jump in i

386
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,720
think the answer from the last itf

387
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,600
though is

388
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,040
no it doesn't feel like there are

389
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,160
major

390
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,120
overlaps in normative claims between

391
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,959
these drafts at this point or the

392
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,079
purposes of the drafts

393
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
thanks eric

394
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,040
uh so

395
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,600
if that's the

396
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,360
i guess the question is to the to the

397
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,279
group uh

398
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,880
you know that are

399
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,120
are the various concerns that uh some

400
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,240
have had about overlap addressed by this

401
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,199
conversation is there are there other

402
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,399
aspects that we need to discuss

403
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,639
yeah this is gary here i i had a

404
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,959
question directly to eric uh

405
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,279
uh i'm gonna take a break from my notes

406
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,440
and then i'll transcribe my question uh

407
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,639
as in

408
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,720
as a uh as a uh eat co-editor there is a

409
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,839
put there is a pull request outstanding

410
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,560
on

411
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,320
on attestation results and lawrence is

412
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,000
created

413
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,560
i am taking your last statement to mean

414
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,440
that there is no conflict between that

415
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,079
pull request in your draft as written is

416
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,320
that correct

417
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
currently that i would agree with that

418
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,519
there is

419
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,839
what i've seen with the software result

420
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,680
and the stuff that has gone into the

421
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,360
draft recently

422
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
we have existing

423
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,040
claims uh where there is a conclusion

424
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,120
about that claim made as part of

425
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,720
software result

426
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,440
and having supplementary verifier

427
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,599
approval of information is a very

428
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,079
different thing that what draft void is

429
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,839
doing which is

430
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,000
evaluating the overall

431
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,760
trustworthiness of a device itself so

432
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,280
it's it's

433
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,879
very independent claims yes

434
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,000
just as a follow-up so you would have no

435
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,480
objection to us uh it has incorporating

436
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,559
a pull request

437
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,679
and uh

438
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,520
and uh bringing that to bringing that

439
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,000
particular claim in to eat

440
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,919
i think that's an independent question i

441
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,320
don't know if i would want to see that i

442
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,880
don't have any problem with it

443
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,160
uh the so the the software result uh but

444
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,240
i think it's an independent question on

445
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,559
whether people want the details

446
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,960
of the verifier results against each

447
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,080
claim

448
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,320
so if you're saying that i i have no

449
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,559
problem from a scope overlap

450
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,559
i have no real uh experience

451
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,280
in my use of verifiers to want that

452
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,080
level of detail in a relying party

453
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,679
personally i think relying parties

454
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,679
should be

455
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,160
simply relying on very high level

456
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,760
conclusions

457
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,760
from a verifier

458
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,240
so i wouldn't want to verify a reliant

459
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,320
party that is really looking at a lot of

460
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,919
detail

461
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,400
from a

462
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,160
from another device

463
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,440
so

464
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,320
i guess you're getting into a

465
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,919
philosophical question and the

466
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,400
philosophical question to me is i want

467
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,320
my relying parties to be very simple and

468
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,960
dumb but if eat finds a use for having a

469
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,000
lot of details about individual claims

470
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,520
and people want to use that then you

471
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,000
know sure go right ahead

472
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,400
okay thank you okay all right there it

473
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,559
goes

474
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,679
um uh eric can i ask you do you think

475
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,919
there's a place where

476
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,480
the relationship between these documents

477
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,280
should be permanently recorded so that

478
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,600
the next person who says

479
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,919
how do these pieces fit together has

480
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,799
somewhere to go to look

481
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
that's a good question

482
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,760
i do think that

483
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,600
what we don't have as a working group

484
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,720
right now

485
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,000
is a description of what the objects are

486
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,559
and how they relate

487
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,080
and

488
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,919
and i think the question really is as we

489
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,240
define objects how do we understand the

490
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,320
schema dependencies between different

491
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,879
objects

492
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
and that is an open question that i

493
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,039
don't think we've addressed as a working

494
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,240
group to say what are the

495
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,760
what are the uh

496
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,640
the

497
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,120
ways these particular claims interrelate

498
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,039
and that's a very hard problem if we

499
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,520
want to go ahead and try to pick that up

500
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,039
i do think that's a very large

501
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,400
conversation

502
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,840
to say how

503
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840
how do we make sure that our that our

504
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,959
information models

505
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,559
have

506
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,799
reasonable ties between them and that's

507
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,158
how i've reframed that question

508
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
adam's on the queue and then i think we

509
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,520
need to lock the queue

510
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,880
i'll just a

511
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,159
tail off of guy's comment on a document

512
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,120
to

513
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
say how these pieces fit together but

514
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,159
also possibly i think it's more of a

515
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,120
support document of being justifications

516
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,520
for why it ended up this way in a way

517
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,799
because i know some of it might be on

518
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,559
the mailing list but some of it was

519
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,400
through discussion and

520
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,960
learning over time yeah this doesn't

521
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,480
really make sense to put these two

522
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,240
pieces together and why they're

523
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,559
separated now so five years from now

524
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,000
when someone comes back why didn't these

525
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,720
two pieces go together we have a

526
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,240
justification

527
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,240
just

528
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,120
can't hear you lawrence if you're

529
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,400
speaking

530
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,080
oh um yeah

531
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,080
i had a slide i sent you i guess that's

532
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,120
not in the deck for presentation

533
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,559
um

534
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,840
on attestation results that i wanted to

535
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,158
present

536
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,720
okay um i'm gonna just say what was in

537
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,240
the slide then i think this is actually

538
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,320
really important so i don't see

539
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,280
attestation results as um

540
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,720
just one thing there's not going to be

541
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,440
one attestation results draft

542
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,520
um there

543
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,440
there are many forms of attestation

544
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,600
results attestation results in in my

545
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,840
view

546
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,640
could be as simple as a boolean yes or

547
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,760
no or maybe a yes no

548
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,880
error code

549
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,360
very very very simple

550
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,600
annotation results could be like eric's

551
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,200
draft the

552
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,240
a particular conception of a vector of

553
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,039
uh

554
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,360
eight values attestation results could

555
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,000
be a very large pile of

556
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,039
claims that are input to a machine

557
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,880
learning based risk engine

558
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,480
anastasia results could include

559
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,640
certification information about the

560
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,440
device through a dloa

561
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,200
ethnic attestation results could be in

562
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,520
eat format so eric's draft could be

563
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,440
implemented in terms of eat or it could

564
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,960
be implemented in terms of yang or

565
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,159
something else

566
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,520
attestation results could be

567
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,799
sea war or json or snmp or xml or all

568
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,520
kinds of things like that so

569
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,520
i basically see uh

570
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,320
the relationship between eat and eric's

571
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
draft is kind of uh

572
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,720
i mean whether there's overlap or not or

573
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,320
competition or not is really the wrong

574
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,480
question the the point is uh is like

575
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,159
it's a the the relationship is a little

576
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,159
more subtle you can um

577
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,280
use

578
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,960
eat as kind of a

579
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,039
substrate or a

580
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,559
you know basis for implementing eric's

581
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,039
draft it can be the basis for imp for

582
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,320
attestation results in some other uh

583
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,919
form you know maybe

584
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,520
i don't know geary defines an

585
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,039
attestation results

586
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,720
scheme um

587
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,360
and eric's draft could be also done

588
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,039
in

589
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,760
snmp or yang or uh something else right

590
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,559
so

591
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,240
uh i think that

592
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,400
i mean one of my one of my requests is

593
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,200
it would be if um eric's draft is

594
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,640
adopted that it not be called

595
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,960
attestation results as if it were

596
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,720
the sole solution for attestation

597
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,120
results

598
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,760
okay uh in the interest of time i think

599
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,919
we need to move on

600
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,240
thank you gary

601
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,039
so next up is

602
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,640
direct anonymous attestation

603
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,880
hank

604
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,400
stepping up trying to yeah and i am

605
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,279
audible i hope

606
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,880
so this is a

607
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,000
relatively small presentation about

608
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,080
again direct anonymous adaptation thank

609
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,159
you for the time here

610
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,760
um i think

611
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,200
next to dave

612
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,240
we are the only authors here in the room

613
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,760
at the moment next time please

614
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,960
so um

615
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,440
i was a little bit confused on the list

616
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,039
because i thought there was a working

617
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:35,919
group

618
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,760
adoption coil but it was a call for

619
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,400
comments on the adoption

620
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,559
and then there was an actual adoption

621
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,960
coil but i think these

622
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,200
might have been conflated on the list a

623
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,039
little bit so i'm not sure if there is

624
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,880
an actual difference

625
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,919
uh on participant's side here uh at this

626
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,400
visible difference so my first question

627
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,840
would be

628
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,720
where are we right now

629
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,880
i'm looking at the

630
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,880
mail list right now

631
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,159
um hank

632
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,799
and i'm trying to see

633
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,000
if there were

634
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,400
any comments to

635
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,039
the and my apologies if i didn't make

636
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,240
that clear

637
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,279
um

638
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,120
because i did put out a call for

639
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,000
adoption earlier this month

640
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,760
closing the adoption today

641
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,200
um

642
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,400
[Music]

643
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,120
all i saw was a comment question from

644
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,039
ned

645
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,360
um

646
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,559
so

647
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,020
so the most comments have been

648
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,520
[Music]

649
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,960
they're coming in when you are asking

650
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,760
for comments and not for adoption

651
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,159
so so that that is why i found this in

652
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,640
this picture yeah yeah

653
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,279
um so perhaps the question we should be

654
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,279
asking right now

655
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,480
hank

656
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,919
you have addressed the comments that um

657
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,840
came in earlier

658
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,640
back in may july right

659
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,919
yeah um actually we all did so yeah

660
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,400
sorry all the authors yes

661
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,720
um okay so

662
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,320
let's just ask the question now then

663
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,640
um

664
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,200
question is whether i need to put a poll

665
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,720
um

666
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,440
for

667
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,720
adoption so does this working group um

668
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,279
believe this is important work and we

669
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,320
should adopt it as a working group

670
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,879
document

671
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,960
lawrence you're in the queue

672
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,039
i just forgot to get out of the queue

673
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,279
oh

674
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,320
so i'll jump into the queue

675
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,120
if there's no one there but basically my

676
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,840
feedback is that given

677
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,400
that there appears to

678
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,919
there's still work that appears to be

679
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,960
needed to support sort of the broad

680
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,840
class of daa

681
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,600
algorithms uh specifically the

682
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,200
intel's epid

683
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,640
it seems that there's more work that's

684
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,960
needed

685
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,799
yeah and i think we should do this in

686
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,240
the working group

687
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,919
as a working group item i think that is

688
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,559
not a single uh

689
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,279
author team's job to address because

690
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,159
because this is basically external input

691
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,159
and i think that's the working good

692
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,159
process right

693
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,440
yeah so

694
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,279
uh okay so i just started a poll

695
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,520
so

696
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,919
whether we need to work

697
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,080
whether the draft needs work more work

698
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,960
or not it goes to the question of do we

699
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,559
believe the working group needs to be

700
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,440
addressed

701
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,120
addressing

702
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,240
direct anonymous attestations

703
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,559
and

704
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,679
that being said whether we can adopt

705
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,320
this particular draft as the starting

706
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,600
point

707
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,000
so this goes to the point of does the

708
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,520
working group believe we should be

709
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,080
adopting this draft as a working group

710
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,440
item

711
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,600
and then we can start posting issues

712
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
against that so

713
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,840
um please respond to the poll

714
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,199
we'll give it a few

715
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,120
i'll give it another minute or two

716
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,279
sorry i'm just not raising my hand but

717
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,159
if nobody's on the cube consider that uh

718
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,880
right hand can i ask a question to hank

719
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,919
on this

720
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,919
talk go for it gary

721
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,159
yeah

722
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,200
so how do we make sure that we're not in

723
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,120
conflict with what the tcg is already

724
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,399
defined

725
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,679
by

726
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,840
by bringing such a draft in into this

727
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,000
working group

728
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,399
we are working with the initial creators

729
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,880
of that work in tcg

730
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,480
into collaboration they are their

731
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,520
co-authors

732
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,200
and when we are aligning this of course

733
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,600
with the tsg tcg at the station working

734
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,720
group

735
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,640
um let me let me put it another way what

736
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,520
is the

737
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,200
then what is the purpose we already have

738
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,159
that uh

739
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,840
we already have specification being

740
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,120
defined

741
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,440
yeah but we do not map that to the reds

742
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,360
architecture so that introduces new

743
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,000
terminology and we have no idea how to

744
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,640
for example place the daa issuer

745
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
is that its own role where do we do this

746
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,559
how does it work with subscription how

747
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,640
do the others models map that will be

748
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,720
work that is to be done in this document

749
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,720
here um it's very unclear uh how because

750
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,600
daa is is just this is basically tpm

751
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,480
work

752
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,720
and and and even even with the dice

753
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,399
relationship it is it is

754
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,080
not clear whether gets architecture how

755
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,120
this should work so we define roles and

756
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,440
conceptual messages and now we have to

757
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,240
understand how would these roles uh and

758
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,880
messages we have to modified or extended

759
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,919
to support daa and that is already

760
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,000
covered to a significant extent in the

761
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,559
document today but as ned's comments

762
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,240
show uh there are still some

763
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,679
parts of the solution that we do not

764
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,960
cover yet and uh so i think documenting

765
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,799
that and highlighting how this works in

766
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,720
relationship with the architecture is

767
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,120
fundamental to how it is implemented

768
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,640
then as a

769
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,080
let's call it itf interoperable solution

770
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,240
okay i'm gonna call time since i'm hold

771
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,039
on a sec since i'm i'm running the poll

772
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,480
i can't lock the queue so um

773
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,600
kathleen

774
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
you can help me lock the queue

775
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,640
because we've got roman and dave and

776
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,320
we're running out of time and there are

777
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,000
two other things that we need to cover

778
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,159
in the open mic

779
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,480
thank you

780
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,760
so

781
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,880
so um if we can just move on roman

782
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,240
you're in the queue

783
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,480
uh thanks nancy just for the in the

784
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,159
spirit of transparency i want to double

785
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,200
check

786
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,720
that everyone appreciates how we're

787
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,320
doing the consensus here so we did a

788
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,480
call for adoption on the mailing list as

789
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,279
far as i can tell only one non-author

790
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,279
supported it and then what we're doing

791
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,279
here now is confirming what we tried on

792
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,679
the mailing list uh in the working group

793
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,720
and the poll is showing us that 13 or

794
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,039
i'm sorry 15 folks do support adoption

795
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,640
right

796
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,640
right

797
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,760
okay dave you're in the queue

798
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,279
yeah i just wanted to add to what hank

799
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,640
was saying in response to the question

800
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,159
what's the purpose

801
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,519
daa as a concept is not specific to tcg

802
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,240
although it needs to be aligned um there

803
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,399
we also want to specify it in the ietf

804
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,159
such that if you're using non-tcg

805
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,000
related use cases

806
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,240
you are still capable of doing daa or at

807
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,559
least explains how you can do daa using

808
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:03,600
eats and the rest of the riots

809
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,279
architecture so otherwise completely

810
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,880
agree with hank's answer but i think

811
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,000
that this is important for the working

812
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,240
group thank you

813
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,279
okay thanks and lawrence just um put in

814
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,080
the chat that the daa needs to cover

815
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,039
more than just tcg which we could do

816
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,080
if we adopted this document

817
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,039
okay i'm going to get absolutely

818
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:25,760
yeah

819
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,840
so

820
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,480
we're uh

821
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,960
you know seven minutes over

822
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,799
so but we need we need to move towards

823
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,000
the other one

824
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,480
um okay

825
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,799
all right so um

826
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,960
procedural question the romans since i

827
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,120
had put out the call and the call was

828
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,159
supposed to end by the end of today

829
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,120
um

830
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,519
do i need to confirm this again roman on

831
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,159
the mail list or can i call this

832
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,519
consensus

833
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,760
uh no that that's actually why i wanted

834
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,279
to kind of speak up because typically we

835
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,200
do it the other way which is we do it at

836
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,640
the meeting and then we try to confirm

837
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,320
it on the mailing list and what we and

838
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,159
then you sum the two of those and what

839
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,600
we did what we're doing here is the

840
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,279
reverse which is we started on the

841
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,880
mailing list and we're summing it with

842
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,120
what the meeting results are so to me

843
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,799
you know it doesn't matter which one you

844
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,559
start it's a it's a question of how you

845
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,919
do them together so we don't need to

846
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,360
confirm this again on mail list because

847
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,120
we've already tried that and the other

848
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,559
kind of key thing we might want to ask

849
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,799
is uh we didn't hear any objections

850
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,320
raised but you know now might be a good

851
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,240
time before we decide to adopt it are

852
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,840
there any objections we want to raise

853
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,879
here in the mic to talk about

854
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,519
so ned let's use three more minutes

855
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,399
um

856
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,679
okay so

857
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,360
for for those that

858
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,320
um have objections

859
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,480
if you want to speak now because there

860
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,519
is consensus

861
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,039
i'm not closing the poll yet

862
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,760
i'm gonna count to five oh guy okay

863
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,600
you're in the queue

864
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,559
yeah

865
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,760
nancy

866
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,559
this

867
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,080
would be quite a bit of work wouldn't it

868
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,840
you know is it is it something that is

869
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,239
viewed as important enough in uh to the

870
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,239
larger community to actually put work

871
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,639
into it

872
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,719
well

873
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,560
speaking as the chair

874
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,879
this is why we're posing the question to

875
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,679
the working group

876
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,239
so

877
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,639
given that there is

878
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,800
consensus

879
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,399
uh

880
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,560
i believe this indicates that the

881
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,520
working group believes it is important

882
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,918
um

883
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,480
if

884
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,960
we're running low on time so let's ask

885
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,599
the question um that roman post on the

886
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,800
chat

887
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,639
if you can post on the chat because we

888
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,159
are running over

889
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,800
would you volunteer to work on it

890
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,640
let me give that

891
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,240
a few seconds

892
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,280
crap okay i'm gonna do the pull since

893
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,079
we're running our time

894
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,680
okay so first poll would you be wanting

895
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,839
to work on the daa draft

896
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,400
i'm going to give it 10 more seconds

897
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,760
thanks thomas

898
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,000
okay so we do have

899
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,079
a fair number of folks willing to work

900
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,200
on the draft so i'm going to end that

901
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,760
and then roman can i just say given that

902
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,599
we have people there

903
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,000
should i do another poll for reviewers

904
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,760
i i think this is good enough i mean

905
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,960
we're demonstrating

906
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,560
that up one more

907
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,960
to say so in the chat you know it's just

908
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,480
we're gonna have to you know i'm i'm

909
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,839
sensitive as mentioned in the working

910
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,520
group about having enough bandwidth to

911
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,200
do all the work all the documents at the

912
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,040
same time maybe the follow-on discussion

913
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,280
is about kind of sequencing and we're

914
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,440
this where we should push the energy in

915
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,680
the working group

916
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,760
okay so the question on the chat has

917
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,240
been i'm gonna end the the session uh

918
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,400
what does it mean to not raise hand it

919
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,079
means that you're voting no

920
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,760
i like dave's response okay in the

921
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,160
interest of time um

922
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,800
we we are adopting the daa draft so hank

923
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,119
and the authors please convert it to an

924
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,720
ietf draft

925
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,280
and you have for those who raise their

926
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,880
hand that are willing to work on it

927
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,280
please work with the current authors of

928
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,480
that draft

929
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,000
to improve it

930
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,160
all right that said let's move forward

931
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,598
to the next agenda item

932
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,320
which was what

933
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,640
oh the open mic

934
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,599
uh

935
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,400
concise reference integrity manifest

936
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,800
that's what i have

937
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,040
so we still have one more presentation

938
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,520
oh we do okay i i was looking at the

939
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,160
agenda

940
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,960
so i just think of i assume i will

941
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,520
present on this because thomas is

942
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,480
blocked and yogesh is

943
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,079
not joining and but way is here okay uh

944
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,960
but uh you give away it's like super

945
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,920
late okay let me let me go into this

946
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,079
here then um

947
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,040
so hi this is about um

948
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,720
reference integrity benefits of course

949
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,400
so we have uh

950
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,320
a mission statement here we have to

951
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,800
inform and uh verify about how a tesla

952
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,280
looks like

953
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,599
the initial cut we have here included is

954
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,320
uh the the og reference values i think

955
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,880
the the software results in

956
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,480
in

957
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,760
the new claim in lawrence's um each id

958
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,480
for example would cover that when kosovo

959
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,119
will cover that we have uh we have an

960
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,440
inclusion of verification key material

961
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,960
so to make sure that this evidence is uh

962
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,599
but i have endorsed values so these are

963
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,680
the things that the tester really can't

964
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,079
talk about itself i don't know you did a

965
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,680
tester without the camera looking at

966
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,079
itself can't tell you it's green

967
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,720
yeah so some things have to be uh

968
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,560
endorsed from the outside

969
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,640
these are endorsed values other things

970
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,040
are for example fips compliance some

971
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,520
other what's on the isolation qualities

972
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,400
of a t these a tester i can't really

973
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,240
tell about itself because they are for

974
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,240
example are the hard route of trust that

975
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,880
kickstarts all of these trustworthiness

976
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,400
claims and so

977
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,720
uh that that's of course in here there

978
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,640
are future steps but in the interest of

979
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,200
time i might not go through all of this

980
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,720
i think that's very important to

981
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,760
highlight that uh extensibility is key

982
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,640
here and we have a a vast uh um

983
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,920
maybe

984
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,760
doing that but we have a lot of uh

985
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,960
places where we can add ext code points

986
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,359
uh like like new uh claims that will be

987
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,560
defined uh uh when there's more each

988
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,960
claims in the future and and some things

989
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,680
that we need here uh um so next slide

990
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,919
please

991
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,359
um there is already uh applicability to

992
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,240
this so in tcg this was taken up

993
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,240
actually and uh

994
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,920
they have uh

995
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,960
adopted the information model over there

996
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,800
that's interesting to the uh layered

997
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,359
attestation as these endorsements can

998
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,839
tell you at which sequence which

999
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,680
environment is supposed to create

1000
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,720
evidence about a target environment this

1001
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,880
is called layered attestation here in

1002
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,760
rats and that there has to be some

1003
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,839
verifier guidance how how that makes

1004
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,280
sense and how is that what might not

1005
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,440
make sense so skipping uh for example

1006
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,839
the bootloader in in this chain would

1007
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:21,200
would probably be fatal uh but but if

1008
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,520
the verifier doesn't know that so that

1009
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,200
has to be informed about that there's

1010
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,680
also a profile being created in parallel

1011
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,319
for coram that is specific to the rnpsa

1012
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,079
solution that sr psa token id in in here

1013
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,800
in this working group and and the psa

1014
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,880
endorsements is so to speak the other

1015
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,640
side of the coin again as evidence

1016
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,359
endorsement so this uh this profiling of

1017
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,240
the columns back in parallel level uh

1018
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,000
and and the the use of it in tcg is our

1019
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
our proof of concept and even running

1020
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,520
code

1021
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,680
and then i can i can't really tell a lot

1022
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,440
about this yet but there is a tpm based

1023
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,880
evidence

1024
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,040
project in the enterprise space but the

1025
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,319
uh uh reliable party is a responsible

1026
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,079
party they did not

1027
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,040
agree

1028
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,040
in time that they can disclose anything

1029
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,319
about it but stay tuned that's not a

1030
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,560
secret i just couldn't uh refer with

1031
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,240
them so so we i think we show uh

1032
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,880
or as always early on running codes the

1033
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,280
reason of our site of course is a very

1034
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,240
prominent part there but also

1035
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,800
the applicability to other domains we

1036
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,400
can show with other documents

1037
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,240
this document actually i think is an

1038
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,920
embedded team for public review and will

1039
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,839
be out in i guess next week

1040
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,599
unfortunately so we can't look at this

1041
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,280
today so next slide please

1042
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,240
um there is yeah just basically i

1043
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,400
spoiled that already so this is not here

1044
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,359
yet but if you want to have a look uh

1045
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,880
there's of course not only the uh id we

1046
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,240
incubate most of the stuff in in github

1047
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,280
and uh especially the cdda is reused and

1048
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,920
on for different ids yet so the one the

1049
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,000
cddi is used in column and for the

1050
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,839
profiling of corem and the psa

1051
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,200
endorsement so there is a synergy across

1052
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,319
multiple

1053
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,480
documents already and that is working

1054
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,800
out quite well and the quality increased

1055
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,119
significantly due to that uh

1056
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,960
continuous testing next slide please

1057
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,800
so uh uh yeah these are

1058
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,000
all the pointers so uh co-rim is is is

1059
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,839
basically the bundle i think i said that

1060
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,880
already commit is the heart via

1061
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,359
hierarchy equivalent to code smith co

1062
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,319
suite is a file system specific files

1063
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,000
hashtag

1064
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,560
results from from its claim here uh

1065
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,800
these are typically in fire systems it

1066
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,119
was hard to squeeze

1067
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,160
firmware in hardware components into the

1068
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,960
file system concept so that

1069
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,440
made commit happen it's a concise module

1070
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,440
identifier it's basically the complement

1071
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,480
here so uh a firmware that is not

1072
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,240
located in the file system but on

1073
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,319
hardware like the firmware that's why

1074
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,800
it's called the bay uh is is for example

1075
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,480
referenced here

1076
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,000
and we have of course support for

1077
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,160
coastward as i just highlighted there's

1078
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,880
also a command-line tool thank you i

1079
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,040
think thomas was had deleted on that

1080
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,359
that you can create uh

1081
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,680
columns comets and kosovo's respectively

1082
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,800
on the

1083
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,240
user command line uh at home on your

1084
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,440
system when you have the right tool

1085
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,319
chain uh i think that's really useful to

1086
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,400
get early hands on

1087
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,760
again i'm rushing a little bit through

1088
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,880
this because we lost a little bit of

1089
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,720
time here we want to have an open mic

1090
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,640
still in the end so next slide please

1091
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,359
um there is the uh

1092
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,240
question of uh does this work fit this

1093
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,880
working group and um so we read the

1094
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,599
charter extensively we stared at it hard

1095
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,200
and uh so um i'm not sure if i have to

1096
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,119
run through all the texts here but the

1097
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,359
bolder text is

1098
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,920
our phrasings from the charter

1099
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,400
and so uh of course

1100
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,599
describing an attester to a verifier is

1101
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,680
standardizing formats about assertions

1102
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,920
about the systems components of a test

1103
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,000
styles it's directly associated with

1104
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,160
evidence because you need it

1105
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,240
in corresponding to evidence it is of

1106
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,800
course as a requirement in the uh

1107
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,680
architectures sorry in the reds uh uh

1108
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,280
charter protected and and uh as essence

1109
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,400
would be the evidence and um and it is

1110
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,560
intended to be consumed by verifiers

1111
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,880
which is a role that is covered in the

1112
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,680
architecture uh which is and

1113
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,960
curiously is not covered in the uh

1114
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,280
charter so that is uh something that i

1115
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,680
uh i kind of forgot to be honest

1116
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,760
i thought that the verifier was named

1117
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,520
explicitly in the charter it is not but

1118
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,760
as we send as we focus on evidence at

1119
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,440
the center of the verifier i think it's

1120
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,920
uh just appropriate to uh to do the

1121
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,760
compliment also that is the endorsement

1122
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,720
and the reference values so so basically

1123
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,280
having said that uh all the really

1124
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,520
important things here that is that this

1125
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,480
is

1126
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,200
feuding definitions into this work are

1127
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,800
the supply chain stakeholders so

1128
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,520
everybody who's building tes or

1129
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,640
components for trustworthiness or

1130
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,040
some some software components that are

1131
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,680
uh

1132
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,760
then in the end a testing environment

1133
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,680
for example

1134
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,359
running in tes again uh that these are

1135
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,000
authors on this this document and and to

1136
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,480
some extent uh again i highlighted this

1137
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,000
we we have already uh agreement with tcg

1138
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,440
because they adopted the uh the

1139
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,640
terminology we introduced here

1140
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,240
specifying identifying systems and the

1141
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,880
key material that we use for that so uh

1142
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,119
so that's part of the goals of the chart

1143
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,359
that seems seems to us and this is just

1144
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,240
our office uh opinion here

1145
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,200
to be

1146
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,280
in line with the charter the next slide

1147
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,599
please

1148
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,359
um there are also deliverables defined

1149
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,079
and i think it's rather simple to say

1150
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,839
that we cover deliberate two three and

1151
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,920
four uh three might be arguable because

1152
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,359
you would have to check the use cases i

1153
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,079
just referenced them by by number here

1154
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,240
but i think for all these use cases you

1155
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,800
will require

1156
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,280
a certain supply chain entity

1157
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,400
information about the system components

1158
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,920
and um

1159
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,079
yeah so uh so maybe

1160
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,400
i for the interest of time i'm not

1161
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,240
restating what's in the charter here

1162
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,200
right now

1163
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,880
this is just our

1164
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,560
let's call it analysis

1165
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,920
of of does this work fit into the

1166
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,880
current charter's scope or would we have

1167
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,040
to recharge for this and our assumption

1168
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,520
is well this fits more than we even

1169
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,800
expected

1170
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,960
for it to fit but but again of course

1171
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,960
this is not our decision this is just

1172
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,119
our assessment so that's where we are

1173
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,240
leaving life with is the next slide

1174
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,680
uh can we do

1175
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,319
a uh

1176
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,960
can we do a working group called for

1177
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,200
adoption actually um

1178
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,440
you can see the ongoing work uh on

1179
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,560
github

1180
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,800
how the issues are handled everything is

1181
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,680
very transparently and open there

1182
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,000
the document is in a fairly stable state

1183
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,960
between multiple vendors that uh have

1184
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,640
quite not always the same requirements

1185
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,960
let's call it that and and we are they

1186
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,720
they all seem to be happy with the

1187
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,640
current state right now so that we are

1188
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,160
comfortable with a call for adoption

1189
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,240
there have been thrice weekly design

1190
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,559
meetings we hope to dial that down a

1191
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,079
little bit when this becomes a working

1192
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,000
group item but again we are used to this

1193
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,800
for like a year now so uh so that is

1194
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,040
happening and uh yeah so we are

1195
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,720
comfortable with doing that the charter

1196
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,280
seems to allow for it and so now i would

1197
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,920
place that question first to this uh

1198
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,680
for the attendance in this session of

1199
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,760
the group here then maybe to the list

1200
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,760
but but maybe some early feedback here

1201
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,640
would be nice

1202
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,040
so admittedly i don't know

1203
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,280
uh i haven't been looking at this part

1204
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,200
of the github hank

1205
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,559
um so my first question was to ask who's

1206
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,640
actually reviewed it but i'm also

1207
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,839
looking at the

1208
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,440
open mic time

1209
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,240
um

1210
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,880
and to roman's point

1211
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,119
the prioritization and importance of

1212
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,000
this given all of the other graphs that

1213
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,760
we need to progress

1214
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,839
right

1215
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,839
okay so we had

1216
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,800
oh

1217
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,319
we had people on the queue and then they

1218
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,079
fell off the queue

1219
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,839
guy

1220
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,440
i'm gonna let this go for two more

1221
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,920
minutes okay um yeah and if we were to

1222
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,880
find

1223
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,520
i might put it on the list go ahead guy

1224
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,760
yes thank you um

1225
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,520
hey could you

1226
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,960
help me understand the difference

1227
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,760
between co rim and post switch for

1228
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,800
doing software attestation

1229
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,240
i mean coast weight is what we've been

1230
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,119
saying is the reference integrity format

1231
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,559
fork

1232
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,960
for rats

1233
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,400
that's not software

1234
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,720
and the korean is the bundle

1235
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,880
coram is the manifest so it's a bundle

1236
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,040
of all the items that compose in a

1237
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,200
hierarchy or maybe even inverse things

1238
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,880
on your composite devices they can be

1239
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,280
rather complex but iot devices uh

1240
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,680
luckily so not um

1241
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,680
you need at least a commit that tells

1242
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,119
you this is my device and its firmware

1243
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,680
as soon as you if you or a file system

1244
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,839
kicks in you need to go suit to

1245
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,800
understand if its layout is fine

1246
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,480
and so i think that's the relationship

1247
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,440
the program is the umbrella manifest

1248
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,240
uh where we are some uh uh it's it's

1249
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,280
it's called actually the the the the

1250
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,079
crater it can be an oem the oem for

1251
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,040
example could uh re-label other hardware

1252
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,720
so it's so

1253
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,800
opaque identifiers are important as we

1254
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,000
already established for example in

1255
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,319
and what was it in cheap just now and so

1256
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,480
um so yeah that's that's the korean part

1257
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,480
and commit again is the hardware

1258
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,319
hierarchy including its firmware and

1259
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,240
applicability of environment

1260
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,000
identification and then in this

1261
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
environment there are very often file

1262
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,280
systems

1263
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,280
uh and these file systems are then

1264
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,280
covered by cosplay does that in a

1265
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,240
nutshell answer your question

1266
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,720
okay

1267
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,960
maybe not

1268
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,760
that's fine thank you

1269
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,160
okay

1270
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,040
hank

1271
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,319
i really need the 10 minutes so um

1272
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,480
yeah yeah sure so we can do the call on

1273
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,839
the list

1274
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,760
yeah

1275
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,680
all right um

1276
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,200
okay i realized we we had open mech but

1277
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,800
we had some

1278
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,960
items left

1279
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,400
um eric is it quick

1280
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,720
i was trying to get an open mic so if we

1281
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,640
want to wait i'll wait for that

1282
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,599
oh

1283
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,119
you're jumping the queue

1284
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:26,000
um

1285
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,800
so

1286
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,960
so um

1287
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,680
we have two open items that we started

1288
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,319
on whenever it was that we met on monday

1289
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:35,520
um

1290
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,880
one was we're trying to assess readiness

1291
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,440
of the eat draft for working group last

1292
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,400
call

1293
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,839
there was discussion about including

1294
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:49,280
the claims needed to satisfy teep

1295
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,520
i can report um

1296
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,000
but then dave i'd like you to also

1297
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,119
elaborate

1298
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,880
we

1299
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,599
the team working group actually met this

1300
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:00,800
morning

1301
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,760
and we discussed

1302
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,200
the claims that teep needed to assess

1303
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,359
and i'll just put the broader one

1304
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,640
whether they were unique to teep or not

1305
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,839
and i believe that in one of the polls

1306
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,640
the answer was that it was not but

1307
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,118
however

1308
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,079
teep would like to see it done in the

1309
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:25,680
eat draft

1310
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,520
but the e draft should consider for

1311
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,720
and now i can't remember

1312
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,720
having it be

1313
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,960
a

1314
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,119
preventer extensibility that's all i

1315
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:43,200
remember dave help me out here

1316
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,520
sure uh so i'd put this on the uh list

1317
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,559
so you should have it all in your

1318
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,480
mailboxes because i put it in the uh

1319
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,400
break because teeth met right before

1320
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,800
rats and so i put the conclusions and

1321
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,240
thank you to all of the rats people who

1322
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,599
are actually there in the teat meeting

1323
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,040
but not all of you were and in

1324
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,720
particular gary and lawrence were not

1325
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,319
and so i tried to represent the views

1326
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,000
that you play from the list in that

1327
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,800
meeting and so the takeaway from uh teep

1328
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,599
is that uh t uh believes that the

1329
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,160
concept of a class identifier is not

1330
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,480
type specific and the recommendation is

1331
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,880
specifically that the eat spec would

1332
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,880
would define a claim but leave the

1333
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,200
definition of the values of the claim to

1334
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,760
profiles and to vendors in other words

1335
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,000
the t profile would be responsible for

1336
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,720
specifying a specific values of that

1337
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,400
claim that would be useful for keep and

1338
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,559
what the meanings of those values are

1339
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,839
and also to uh that the e would be able

1340
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,880
to specify how a vendor gets a value in

1341
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,480
other words there's a way for profiles

1342
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,000
to get values and a way for vendors to

1343
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,119
get values and so that is the outcome

1344
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,400
density did polls there was pretty

1345
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,079
strong consensus on that and the only

1346
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,720
other requirement that was in a separate

1347
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,599
poll

1348
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,319
was odd the values opaque or structured

1349
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:55,440
and i would say there was a fairly

1350
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,599
strong consensus across all of the

1351
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,839
community all of the rat suit and team

1352
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,000
members were present there were zero

1353
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,680
against of saying that it should be

1354
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,760
opaque in other words that there is no

1355
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,240
structure and so there were some that

1356
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,680
had argued that it would be nice if the

1357
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,920
format was something like auit just

1358
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,119
because that

1359
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,040
helps to ensure opaqueness but that was

1360
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,680
a decision left up to rat so again

1361
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,440
opaque please and

1362
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,599
the request to define a claim but leave

1363
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,040
the definition of the values and the

1364
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,920
semantics of the values to uh

1365
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,920
uh profiles and it would be fine if rat

1366
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,760
says well okay here's a claim and the

1367
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,599
profile in order to have values here's

1368
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:32,960
the requirements for that profile to

1369
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,480
define a value and what you have to do

1370
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,319
for it um and so that's kind of my

1371
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,640
summary of what i heard as the outcome

1372
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,160
of the polls so thanks

1373
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,440
thanks dave uh lawrence you're in the

1374
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,680
queue

1375
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,000
yeah so

1376
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,559
i there there were comments on

1377
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,599
uh github from thomas and jeremy about

1378
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,760
this that i don't think uh line up with

1379
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,359
uh other

1380
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:02,960
discussion here so i don't think there

1381
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,559
is consensus on this particular claim um

1382
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,079
so i think and

1383
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,520
but that said um in terms of uh

1384
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,280
working group last call

1385
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,000
this is a relatively minor issue um i

1386
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,079
mean i think the bigger issues in terms

1387
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,839
of working working group last call is uh

1388
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,520
things we were that we discussed uh you

1389
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:28,400
know uh were about the cddl for uh gwt

1390
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,160
and cwt and whether we're really gonna

1391
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,680
do uh both json and seabor

1392
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,520
so on this particular issue i'd like to

1393
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,440
take the i'd like the design discussion

1394
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,880
for class to go to the mailing list and

1395
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,640
maybe be separate from working group

1396
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,118
last call

1397
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,640
okay okay well said lauren so that said

1398
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,119
i'm starting a poll

1399
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:50,960
um to see

1400
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,200
if the group believes the eat draft is

1401
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,839
ready for working group last call

1402
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:57,599
and i believe lawrence you did update

1403
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,000
the draft so i'm speaking to the latest

1404
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,480
uh we haven't pushed out a dash 12 yet

1405
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,799
but we're ready to

1406
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:07,839
okay

1407
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,240
so nancy your question is on is draft 11

1408
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,680
ready for last call correct that's the

1409
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,079
correct meaning of the question

1410
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,119
so everybody's answering the same

1411
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:16,640
question

1412
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,040
yeah i guess we should put it on draft

1413
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:23,920
11 given that draft 12 isn't out yet

1414
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,720
but then but then the answer is clearly

1415
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,079
no because uh the draft 12 is already in

1416
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,640
the pipeline

1417
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,720
draft draft 12 is uh draft 12

1418
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,240
on things such as the class claim is

1419
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,160
awaiting consensus we're not ready to

1420
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,839
push that out

1421
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,599
we will push out of draft 12 with last

1422
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:49,599
call comment resolution as well we don't

1423
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,119
need to

1424
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,480
we don't need to push it out right now

1425
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,520
thank you so

1426
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,520
remember we can always pull a second

1427
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,079
working group last call right

1428
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,559
so we know that we need to

1429
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:08,319
yes yeah honest it's a pre-last call

1430
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:09,920
but we need to make sure that the other

1431
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,520
things that we've been discussing in the

1432
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,520
past

1433
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,079
are maturing enough and i know that we

1434
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,240
well the group should take note that we

1435
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,640
need to solidify

1436
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,200
the claims

1437
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,599
so that said i'm going to give it a few

1438
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:28,480
more seconds

1439
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,839
i'm gonna count to five

1440
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,839
one

1441
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,839
okay so it looks like we have consensus

1442
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:46,000
for the minute takers please

1443
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,599
note since i my laptop's still not well

1444
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,520
um as an action item

1445
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,079
the chairs will do a first working group

1446
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,640
last call

1447
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,400
all right

1448
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,440
so one down the second one roman i'll

1449
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,079
i'll need your help here since i keep

1450
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:11,119
not

1451
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,680
clarifying my notes too well

1452
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,960
um

1453
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,119
the second one was there's been

1454
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,280
questions about the status of the

1455
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,960
architecture draft

1456
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,040
we went through a working group last

1457
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,000
call

1458
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,200
i want to say we started that last year

1459
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,359
we had a whole round of comments they

1460
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:33,119
were addressed

1461
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,119
um i guess we had a pre and then we had

1462
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,839
another sort of more official last call

1463
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:39,440
earlier this year

1464
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,640
um in which most of the issues were

1465
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,240
addressed

1466
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:48,000
we had um the process of going through

1467
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,760
the shepherding as part of the

1468
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,960
shepherding

1469
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,160
there was some ipr issues that came up

1470
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,360
and so i tried to put the

1471
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,599
[Music]

1472
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,400
the discussion of just the ipr on the

1473
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,160
mail list to ensure that there was

1474
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,960
consensus that we could move forward

1475
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,599
um given that there were

1476
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,960
two ipr claims um put out so

1477
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,160
as far as i believe if i can speak on

1478
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,920
behalf of the chairs

1479
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,359
um kathleen you can speak up as well and

1480
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,599
roman you can help me here too

1481
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,960
um we should be ready to put this out to

1482
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,920
iesg for publication

1483
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,359
um if we can get the consensus

1484
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,839
from the working group that we're fine

1485
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:36,000
with the current iprs

1486
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,559
um that have been posted

1487
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,359
that you're fine moving the drafts or to

1488
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:44,160
publication yes so i agree and i think

1489
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,720
just making sure we have a time on

1490
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,920
providing feedback on the ipr statement

1491
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,160
was all that was needed and so typically

1492
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,200
we do two weeks for that type of

1493
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,920
of call right so um or for any type of

1494
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,400
call on a list so if we could just

1495
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,079
mark it as two weeks from there and then

1496
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:03,440
a shepherd

1497
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,520
i will work with nancy because you know

1498
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,680
ipr is a little more complex but um so i

1499
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,599
won't work as shepard in a box

1500
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,400
on that part and we'll come to agreement

1501
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,480
on the feelings of the working group and

1502
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,720
then we'll progress it to

1503
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,040
um the next step which is pushing it to

1504
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,440
the iesg and then

1505
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,000
for working group last call and then the

1506
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,319
area reviews can kick off at that point

1507
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:27,359
but they'll want to know what the

1508
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,280
working group thinks on ipr so we really

1509
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,200
can't jump the gun on that

1510
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,359
thank you nancy

1511
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:34,400
yep

1512
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,160
so i just wanted to make sure that was

1513
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,920
clear roman i don't know if you have

1514
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,040
anything else to add

1515
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,079
uh i mean you and you and uh you and

1516
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,319
kathleen laid it out exactly right i

1517
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:47,920
mean i would just reiterate to the

1518
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,040
working group

1519
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,760
we're through the the technical reviews

1520
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,160
uh inside the working group we just

1521
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,880
tripped over this ipr issue and so now

1522
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,640
is the time that the working group

1523
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,720
should raise objection or provide

1524
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,720
concurrence that despite this new

1525
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,200
information related to the ipr you are

1526
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,720
still interested in the document

1527
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,119
proceeding forward or wait this is

1528
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:10,640
completely new information and this

1529
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,480
changes your perspective on whether we

1530
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,720
should be proceeding and depending on

1531
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,040
how much you know

1532
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,119
how much harmony there is on that kind

1533
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:20,960
of decision that's perhaps as simple as

1534
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,480
documenting it and putting in the

1535
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,079
shepherd right up as kathleen kind of

1536
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:26,400
indicated or if we have less

1537
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,839
less kind of convergence on the way

1538
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:29,119
ahead it's going to be a longer

1539
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,200
conversation so this could be as short

1540
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,240
as advancing the document to me by you

1541
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,799
know early early december late november

1542
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:38,160
or you know it could be a longer

1543
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,640
conversation uh let's just sort this out

1544
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,480
in the next kind of week and i believe

1545
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,920
with the two week call we're going to

1546
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,680
close it next next at the end of next

1547
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,799
week

1548
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:48,400
that's correct

1549
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,160

1550
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,480

1551
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,640
at running us over for a minute so i'm

1552
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,799
just going to close by saying we did run

1553
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:58,079
out of time

1554
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:00,000
we can put on the main list the call for

1555
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,599
adoption for the the other

1556
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,599
attestation results and at the station

1557
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,280
set so that one we can put on the mail

1558
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,599
list um

1559
