00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,920
uh can you hear me

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,080
yes hey adam i know i said i could you

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,840
know we might want two two note takers

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,440
but there's gonna be a lot of slides and

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,040
stuff so like i'm happy to do the whole

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,320
time

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,960
oh thank you very much

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,640
one last thing to ask about here as we

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,199
get started

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,560
much appreciated

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,279
i'm here for you

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,238
adam your driving slides right

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,718
that's right

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,559
trying to remember all the icons are

15
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,719
here for

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,920
getting the slide started

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,840
second from the left adam will get you

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,600
the repo from the data tracker

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,959
the second left for me is gallery view

20
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,560
uh under

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,880
beneath your name

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,880
in the upper left hand corner

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,158
ah thank you very much

24
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,240
so it's my first time sharing with meat

25
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,280
echo and i'm not sure exactly what i'm

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,799
supposed to be seeing

27
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,159
the uh

28
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,200
icon is lit up

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,759
but i'm not actually seeing any slides

30
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,840
myself and

31
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,399
we can see the slides

32
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,079
so i think you're good to go if you want

33
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,159
to turn on video you can

34
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,920
adam you probably need to click on the

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,719
interview and uh yeah the the icon on

36
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,360
the on the left on the upper right stuff

37
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,598
oh thank you there's the problem okay

38
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,800
just a little bit of a learning curve

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,319
here

40
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,319
all right so we're a couple minutes past

41
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,840
the top of the hour here so i think it's

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,680
time to go ahead and get started

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,760
um you're in the pro ball which should

44
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,319
come as no surprise

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,440
right now there we go so we're going to

46
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,800
start off

47
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,680
with the traditional note well

48
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,440
if this is a surprise to you it

49
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,840
shouldn't be

50
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,000
is basically saying if you know of any

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,800
uh

52
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,879
patent rights associated with anything

53
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,560
that you discuss um there are

54
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,440
obligations uh that are described in

55
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,760
uh bcp79 uh please go read it and also

56
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,519
behave yourself that's basically the

57
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,319
dental just here

58
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,120
so we have uh peterson andre has

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,360
volunteered to take notes initially he

60
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,400
was going to take it for half of the

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,959
session but he just very kindly stepped

62
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,560
up for the entire session so we're good

63
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,959
there um traditionally we have a java

64
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,440
scribe for those folks who

65
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
are not on audio but want to ask

66
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,120
questions do we have someone who can

67
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,800
just monitor the chat in case there's

68
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,560
someone who for whatever technical

69
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,159
reason can't speak

70
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,239
uh needs to have a question taken to the

71
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,800
microphone

72
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,080
okay i think i see chris saying yes we

73
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,159
agreed

74
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,798
thank you very much

75
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,599
all right so

76
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,360
overall agenda

77
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,720
we have um we're gonna start out with uh

78
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,440
25 minutes from ecker talking about uh

79
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,720
ppm

80
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,000
and how it's different from what we've

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,200
done before

82
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
we're going to go through use cases from

83
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,720
a handful of folks

84
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,879
um and then talk about how this relates

85
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,200
to some work going on in the cfrg

86
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,720
research group

87
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,159
after that we're going to have a bit

88
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,599
more discussion

89
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,519
around the charter and expressions of

90
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,720
interest

91
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,280
does anyone want to suggest changes to

92
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,080
the agenda we have here

93
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,279
all right hearing no objection um just a

94
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,880
few notes on this this is a working

95
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,560
group forming buff the goal is to make

96
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,560
sure that everyone understands what the

97
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,120
problem is that we're trying to solve

98
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,400
and we're going to talk about

99
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,040
uh potential solutions here but we're

100
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,120
not going to try to like improve those

101
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,120
solutions or anything along those lines

102
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,160
we'll be taking questions for

103
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,360
clarification after the first

104
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,440
presentation that explains the problem

105
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,400
and then we're going to have four

106
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,040
presentations on associated use cases um

107
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,400
we're going to ask that the questions on

108
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,759
the use cases are held until after the

109
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,199
four speakers are done because they're

110
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,479
fairly short slots and we want to get

111
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,160
through them quickly and those are going

112
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,919
to be for clarification and then we're

113
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,600
going to talk about as i mentioned

114
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,440
previously how this relates to some work

115
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,280
going on in the cfrg

116
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,039
and then we have almost an hour at the

117
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,039
end here um to talk about

118
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,280
uh the charter for the working group and

119
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,960
and general discussion

120
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
to provide input for the security ads

121
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,840
and for the iasg

122
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,520
all right so we're going to go ahead and

123
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,960
hop on to

124
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,720
echo's presentation here so i group you

125
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,759
could grab the slides

126
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,080
slides but it does not seem to be having

127
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,280
any impact so i think you have to do

128
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,599
something

129
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,000
um

130
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,680
see

131
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,360
there we go

132
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,840
yeah

133
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,000
fantastic uh i'm actually um despite

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,080
what it says on the uh on the agenda i'm

135
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,600
going to merge the discussion of the

136
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,960
things we're trying to accomplish with

137
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,199
the discussion of technology um because

138
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,199
i think it's easier to understand the

139
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,720
motivating cases so i'll just fold them

140
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,080
right in right having a separate use

141
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,360
cases uh presentation um

142
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,039
so uh um

143
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,360
i'll say i sent a link i've written up

144
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,720
quite a bunch of interactive material on

145
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,080
this so if people want to read that i

146
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,240
sell a link in the java chat um

147
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,919
um and obviously something is unclear

148
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,560
please stop me and and you know ask

149
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,520
um

150
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,880
so okay let's move on

151
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,360
um so there you go i like to start so

152
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,880
here's just like the traditional like

153
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,840
this is what i'm going to talk about

154
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
kind of in order um first i want to talk

155
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
about like the kinds of things like one

156
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,120
actually wants to measure in these

157
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,639
typical settings then i want to talk

158
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,800
about um anonymous measurement there's

159
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,160
like one approach you might take to it

160
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,840
and then i want to talk about um the

161
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,039
kind of multi-party cryptographic

162
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,880
techniques that are the focus of this um

163
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,800
of this buff um and then i'll sort of

164
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,160
talk about the technical architecture

165
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,520
for the protocol that we sort of

166
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,600
developed that are hoping to you know

167
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,080
pull in in this work

168
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,520
um

169
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,960
that's about all the science and plan to

170
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,039
do so there's a lot of situations where

171
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,800
like one would like to learn about

172
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,560
people right um you know we have like

173
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,319
the the census um or you know there's a

174
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,400
lot of public research um you know and

175
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,479
you learn things like demographics and

176
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,160
you know people's income um you know

177
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,240
maybe they have medical issues um you

178
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,840
know companies want to do um product

179
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,440
development so to see what features that

180
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,840
um you know people um using don't use um

181
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,440
how much they use them like are the

182
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,520
products not working in some way um and

183
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,400
then you also want to take like

184
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,720
behavioral measurements like like so um

185
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,240
you know say you want to discover like

186
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,680
new websites that no one knows about or

187
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,880
what information people care about so

188
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,319
you can tune your product to be like

189
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,639
more like what people actually want um

190
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,479
uh so i mean there was a good example of

191
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,560
this on the other day um

192
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,960
uh um when brave doesn't posting about

193
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,240
like their new search engine and how

194
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,520
they like want to discover websites for

195
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,840
the search engine um

196
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,199
so um

197
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,639
um so all these problems involve like

198
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,160
collecting data

199
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,680
um

200
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,280
um the information of course is like

201
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,080
very useful but it also um is you know

202
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
can be very very sensitive um you know

203
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,599
people often don't want to and shouldn't

204
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,960
have to disclose you know their medical

205
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,720
issues in order in order we want to

206
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,000
learn how many people have some medical

207
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,560
condition um you know that's that's good

208
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,759
because we want to know you know where

209
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,960
we're finding should be targeted for

210
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,479
instance but we don't want to know what

211
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,240
individuals have like you know medical

212
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,919
conditions that's like that

213
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,520
um same thing it's true for your income

214
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,960
efficient orientation all those things

215
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,840
um

216
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,400
uh someone is unmuted based peter um if

217
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,280
you could

218
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,360
um i know it's not me because i'm not

219
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,160
typing um um and um you know it turns

220
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,680
out that like not only the things you

221
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,199
naturally think of sensitive sensitive

222
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,720
but even like much less sensitive data

223
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,160
can be very revealing and of course this

224
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,319
is like how ad targeting works um and it

225
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,879
turns out that there's like a lot of um

226
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,599
a lot of like evidence that um you can

227
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,000
put like less sensitive data together um

228
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,559
this is often called like um uh um high

229
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,719
dimensional sparse data sets and figure

230
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,679
things out that people would be

231
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,039
surprised and so i had this this is you

232
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,200
know from an article a few years ago um

233
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
about you know target inferring um you

234
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,000
know

235
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,760
a girl was pregnant um by like looking

236
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,120
her other other sort of pershing

237
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,760
behavior um so um

238
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,480
there's been a lot of uh um you know uh

239
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,519
research on this um and what would hope

240
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,800
to do better

241
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,240
um and so like the historical way that

242
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,920
um you know one does these things is

243
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,360
that you just gather all the data and

244
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,920
then you promise not to disclose it um

245
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,480
and you know this is like um not working

246
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,880
out super well um you know data breaches

247
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,240
um there's this the famous case of the

248
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,160
census information we use for targeting

249
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,920
um japanese americans during world war

250
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,320
ii um and so generally we better have a

251
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,600
system that does not involve just like

252
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,279
trusting someone to like handle the data

253
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,440
appropriately um

254
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,680
so the good news is that actually the

255
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,760
data that you want to know

256
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,680
is not necessarily sensitive

257
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,920
um the data you want to know is usually

258
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,160
what's called aggregates so say you

259
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,440
wanted the distribution of people's

260
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,360
income maybe in a particular region or

261
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,399
maybe you want to look at their

262
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,160
relationship between like income and

263
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,080
height which by the way there is one um

264
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,959
or you want to know what the most

265
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,399
popular websites are but i don't care

266
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,399
like what less any individual goes to

267
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,800
what i care about is like what it says

268
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,480
people aggregate too and in fact it's

269
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,160
often not useful to learn the websites

270
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,600
that an individual goes to because maybe

271
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,959
a lot of them are like cardinality i

272
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,440
don't like popular um often you need to

273
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,200
like slice the data in multiple ways to

274
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,320
say um look i just want to look at a

275
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,920
given region or when i compare two

276
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,519
variables i want to regress them against

277
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,240
each other so in these cases um you know

278
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,839
it's as i say it's actually not useful

279
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,560
to have um to have the individual data

280
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,079
beyond what lets you compute these

281
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,399
aggregate metrics and um and of course

282
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,000
it's very harmful individual data if you

283
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,920
misuse it and from the perspective of a

284
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,320
researcher not only um you know it's not

285
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,120
just a matter of um

286
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,519
it's not just a matter of uh

287
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,200
of harmful but it's a matter of

288
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,640
dangerous because now you have to have

289
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,240
also controls and procedures around hand

290
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,519
on the data that make it very hard to

291
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,760
work with um and of course also it makes

292
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,680
it people unwilling to you know share

293
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,640
the data with you if they know if they

294
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,360
think you're not going to handle

295
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,399
responsibly so um you know while there

296
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,320
are situations in which it is necessary

297
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,720
to gather full data and then just say

298
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,640
look you have to trust me um those are

299
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,680
these are ones we should look forward

300
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,200
rather than foster

301
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,440
um

302
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,200
so

303
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,200
i want to tell you a little bit about

304
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,800
the kinds of it's the kind of output

305
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,160
measurements um

306
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,000
you might want um

307
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,200
uh there's a number of common

308
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,160
measurement tasks um that um that we're

309
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,839
hoping to achieve in this working group

310
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,360
um so the first is what's often called a

311
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,959
simple aggregates this is the stuff you

312
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,440
would like learn in an introduced class

313
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,839
of you know um you know uh uh single

314
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:20,959
figures

315
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,800
group statistics that capture some data

316
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,760
so mean median sum histograms i think um

317
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,720
then there's sort of like um you know

318
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,160
relationships between values um

319
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,000
correlation coefficients um ordinary

320
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,519
squares um that kind of stuff um and um

321
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,519
um you know people talk like federally

322
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,560
machine learning that's kind of out of

323
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,399
scope for this but um simple stuff is in

324
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,760
scope um and um and then there's um this

325
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,959
specific problem that's often called

326
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,959
heavy hitters which is collecting common

327
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,320
strengths that a lot of people have it

328
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,680
turns out to be a very useful technique

329
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,519
for numbers and number settings

330
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,360
um so like i said you can notice that

331
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,720
these are all like the aggregate things

332
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,240
i don't depend on any anybody's

333
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,360
individual did it

334
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
um so we just like to find some way to

335
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,120
gather those these aggregates without

336
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
having to be infected by people's

337
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,000
individual data which is like basically

338
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,920
toxic waste at some level

339
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,680
um

340
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,120
so like let me give you like one

341
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,399
motivating use case

342
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,240
um it's very useful to know what kind of

343
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,720
sites you should visit um because then

344
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,160
um if you're like a web browser so that

345
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,360
our backlight use case if you're like

346
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,399
web browser you like to know what kinds

347
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,519
of stuff people visit so you can make

348
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,880
your web browser work well on those

349
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,040
sites and so you can spend and spend

350
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,240
time and say okay well people like

351
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,839
really watch a lot of videos like making

352
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,160
video really work is important um now we

353
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,440
have like some data on this because we

354
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,160
collect like mechanical data uh but like

355
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,880
for obvious reasons um it's unattractive

356
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,959
to know like what topics any individual

357
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,160
is interested in because on this topic

358
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,560
some of those topics are implicat on

359
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,160
information they don't want us to have

360
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,639
um and you know it's it's very difficult

361
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,480
to obviously know exactly what these

362
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,839
people go to is problematic but even

363
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:48,800
knowing the interest people have is

364
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,079
problematic because you can further

365
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,639
things about them and um

366
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,000
and so there's been a lot of work and

367
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,279
and trying to figure out like exactly

368
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,480
what information is sensitive and what

369
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,920
information is not extremely difficult

370
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,360
because in some cases like some

371
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,480
interests are sensitive and in some

372
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,760
cases people think others are not

373
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,519
sensitive and so um there's been a lot

374
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,160
of talk about this um in the ads context

375
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,639
of like what topics are safe um but like

376
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,920
in an ideal world if you didn't care

377
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,040
about privacy what you want to do is

378
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,480
like bucket the sites by topic and then

379
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,760
count the number of like minutes but on

380
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,440
each topic um but like i said we can't

381
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
just do that but so this is another

382
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,720
problem statement is to collect the

383
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,480
distribution of time spent on each type

384
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,800
of site without actually seeing the um

385
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
individualized people on

386
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,000
um

387
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,160
so that's like one motivating this case

388
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,839
another mode of use case again for a

389
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,880
browser um is to see which websites are

390
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,639
having problems of one kind or another

391
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,440
um in some cases these problems are um

392
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,040
i guess innocuous um so like web

393
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,560
compatibility is a big problem some

394
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,079
sites just don't render properly and

395
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,000
like mozilla operates like a thing which

396
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,199
you can press in the upper right hand

397
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,399
corner of your browser somewhere that

398
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,959
says like this site is broken from me um

399
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,920
uh but like but we depend pretty heavily

400
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,600
on people volunteering information

401
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,639
because we obviously don't want to

402
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,199
collect what url everybody's going to um

403
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,800
this is like a bigger problem for

404
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,240
browsers with smaller market shares

405
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,519
because things will often work on like

406
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,600
one engine or not another um so in many

407
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,880
cases we can detect breakers on the

408
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,720
client we know that something's wrong

409
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,240
like they try to use a property we know

410
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,760
it doesn't exist or these are saying

411
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,240
reload constantly like rage clicking but

412
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,519
we can't do anything about it because

413
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,959
like the browser knows but it can't tell

414
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,480
us um

415
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,360
and so that's one example um

416
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,760
another example is um that we know

417
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,800
there's a lot of like what's called

418
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,480
fingerprinting going on so a lot of web

419
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,839
tracking happens with um uh cookies but

420
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,120
there's a lot of which happens without

421
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,320
cookies and um and so what you do is you

422
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,000
like have a bunch of javascript apis and

423
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,519
you can measure how the browser behaves

424
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,440
under those job sheet apis um so an

425
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,560
example people often talk about is

426
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,240
what's called canvas fingerprinting

427
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,160
where you like render some fonts and

428
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,680
then you read back from the canvas and

429
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,880
that gives you information about like

430
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,000
the gpu

431
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,760
uses the machine so you can use this to

432
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,320
build up a like single value which you

433
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,160
can use use like follow the user on the

434
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,399
internet um so this is like a big

435
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,839
tracking that is not addressed by the

436
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,839
kinds of you know third-party cookie

437
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,519
blocking the browsers like firefox and

438
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,760
chrome do um this is again off the

439
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,880
detectable on the client because you're

440
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,560
like why is this person like doing a lot

441
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,920
of canvas readbacks when like they're

442
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,880
not actually just playing anything

443
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,040
meaningful and or like they're actually

444
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,639
loading some some like script which you

445
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,560
know is a tracking script um but you

446
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,760
just can't like report it back for

447
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
exactly the same privacy reason

448
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,160
so we're stuck in the situation where

449
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,399
where if you have like the sort of

450
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,600
accurate information about which sites

451
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,560
are having problems you could just think

452
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,760
about it could you go to the site and

453
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,880
you could like download the script and

454
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,639
find it yourself um uh but um but

455
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,680
doing that would entail collection

456
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,519
browsers distribute problematic um one

457
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,639
thing i would say is people often say

458
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,240
like why don't you just do a scraper um

459
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,920
and you certainly can do that sometimes

460
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,000
um but there are two problems one is

461
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,120
building a scraper that collects that

462
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,720
much information is very expensive and

463
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,000
the second is that it's very easy to

464
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,759
detect when someone has a scraper and if

465
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,079
so especially in these um

466
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,079
in these uh uh fingerprinting cases they

467
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,199
could just send you different different

468
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,519
data fingerprints um so again the

469
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,759
problem statement is to collect

470
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,279
on the sites with the client is seeing

471
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,279
some issue but only to see the hot ones

472
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,199
and only to see and not see individually

473
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,040
um you know what you just have to go

474
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,240
into but just to pick the sites that are

475
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,680
most problematic in one way or another

476
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,959
um and i'm just gonna preview on the the

477
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,399
rest of people here were talking about

478
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,000
on a number of other cases i guess i i

479
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,839
hit this first one so i should have like

480
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,480
um that my slides got changed um but

481
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
there's a bunch of talk i think other

482
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,320
use cases involving but some advertising

483
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,720
work and also some work on covenant

484
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,279
exposure notification measurement um so

485
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,720
um you'll see those later but i mean

486
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,000
this should give you a sense of breath

487
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,199
the kind of problem we have here which

488
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,519
is all kinds of sensitive measurements

489
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,160
you want to collect um that uh

490
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,440
unfortunately are difficult to collect

491
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,279
with pride over privacy with uh like

492
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,639
without fancy technology of the car

493
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,040
we're trying to develop here

494
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,199
um

495
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,199
so um it's important to recognize there

496
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,880
actually are two kinds of privacy

497
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,839
threats with these kinds of data

498
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,560
collections the first is when you

499
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,240
collect sensitive data and it's directly

500
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,320
tied to identifying information so you

501
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,079
say look i like you know did a survey

502
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,279
and like i called people on the phone

503
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,399
and they told me you know they tell me

504
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,000
this sensitive stuff and now like i have

505
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,839
the phone number and like you know they

506
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,360
told me like you know whether they have

507
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,359
a particular medical condition um so

508
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,280
that's that's like a direct tie right um

509
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,359
inside um and and then there's but

510
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,959
there's also this thing um what's called

511
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,760
um uh basically this goes back to um

512
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,000
this high dimensional data sets is often

513
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,439
if you collect enough non-sensitive

514
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,760
information um and then you collect one

515
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,439
piece of intensive information you can

516
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,880
use the nonsense information to figure

517
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,480
out who the person is and so there's

518
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,679
this like famous observation due to the

519
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,079
latin sweeney that like if you just have

520
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,000
five zip code gender and date of birth

521
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,520
you can identify like most population

522
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,400
united states

523
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,160
um and

524
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,400
so um generally and there's like was a

525
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,880
bunch of bunch of work also but um by um

526
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
uh our vernerian um about this netflix

527
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,480
data set were able to find like people's

528
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,240
uh you know who people were by the

529
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,080
netflix netflix browsing history our

530
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,919
viewing history so um we have to solve

531
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,440
both these problems

532
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,559
um so

533
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,000
the naive thing that people often talk

534
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,600
about doing is basically what's called

535
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,520
anonymized data collection and this is

536
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,880
absolutely a viable technique and

537
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,240
there's a bunch of work going on about

538
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,400
it um in ohio working group and the

539
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
basic idea is to strip off all the

540
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,600
identifying meta information and um

541
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,960
and so what the client does the client

542
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,600
like and it encrypts um the data to the

543
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,200
collector and then you have some proxy

544
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,039
in the middle that removes all the

545
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,039
metadata like the ip address

546
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,919
um and so this this avoids the collector

547
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,919
like seeing that meta information but

548
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,679
still gets and because that is encrypted

549
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,280
the proxy never sees the report so that

550
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,200
these things are split up um and we

551
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,799
talked about the trust model for that so

552
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,559
i won't go into that in much detail um

553
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,840
and so the number of ways to do this you

554
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,280
can do this with like additional proxies

555
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,679
like mask or ipsec or 20 sentences or

556
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,039
you can do an application like proxy

557
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,640
like oh hi

558
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,559
um so like this is a very good technique

559
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,320
for a number of cases it's really good

560
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,000
for like sort of boosting the privacy of

561
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,520
semi-sensitive data like did you collect

562
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,799
anyway you say well like i wish it had

563
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,240
the ip address you can get rid of it and

564
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,679
so it's very common now for like

565
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,400
browsers to collect telemetry and we

566
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,600
have the ip address which you just throw

567
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,720
away because we're going to have that

568
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,160
involved um there are also a bunch of

569
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
cases where um you want to collect

570
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
individual values um

571
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,760
and these free from data blobs that you

572
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,679
want to really dig into um it's also

573
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,880
like the only way to do things that need

574
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,320
an answer so if you like actually want

575
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,320
to have not just like data collection

576
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,600
data collection but you also want to

577
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,760
have um data reports like you can't do

578
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,400
that that's you you'll hide for that um

579
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,679
and the techniques we're talking about

580
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,240
don't do that um

581
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,360
but there's a bunch of cases where it

582
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,440
doesn't work well um

583
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,640
and and the most common cases are um

584
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,320
you can't it's not good for like these

585
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,240
high dimensionality data sets where you

586
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,360
need to like take multiple values and

587
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,160
put them together and um and the problem

588
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
is that um goes back to what i was

589
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
saying before if you give me like even

590
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,600
the innocuous demographic information i

591
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,960
use identify the person and so if you

592
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,320
give me this data set that conversion

593
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,480
consists of you know of like your zip

594
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,000
code and your birth date and your income

595
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,280
well i can map that back to you i know

596
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,799
your income so i can't do it so i can't

597
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:45,840
use this if i want to do this kind of

598
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,120
correlation because unfortunately

599
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,280
demographic information is self defined

600
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,400
um

601
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,679
and the same thing is true if you want

602
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,240
to do like crosstabs and subgroups um

603
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,919
it's also not good for collecting um

604
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,200
this kind of heavy hitter stuff and the

605
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,360
reason is because the the even though it

606
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,799
is anonymized you get all the values

607
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,480
even the low cardinality values a lot of

608
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,240
the cardinality values are problematic

609
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
so they might be for instance you know

610
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,120
um you know google capability or else

611
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,360
um

612
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,919
so the good news is over the past 10

613
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,600
years we've done cryptography which

614
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,159
could solve these problems um and um

615
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,440
there's a bunch of fancy crypto which

616
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,600
i'm gonna really only only vaguely

617
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,120
sketch um

618
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,280
but the basic idea is a multi-party

619
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,600
computation so um

620
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,640
you uh the the what the client does is

621
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,039
the client um wants to report some value

622
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,400
and it takes the value and it splits it

623
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
up into two shares with a secret sharing

624
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,880
technique of some kind um and the way

625
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,000
the shares are constructed is that

626
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,440
knowing only one share doesn't give you

627
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,760
any information about the other

628
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,760
value and that that splitting is what's

629
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,120
called information theoretically secure

630
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,320
maybe it doesn't depend on computational

631
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,159
assumptions um

632
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,320
um but um when you put the shares

633
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,600
together they of course represent the

634
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,760
entire value so what you do each client

635
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,280
sends like one share to one server

636
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,120
another share another server and then

637
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,280
the servers take the shares themselves

638
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,880
and they aggregate them they compute the

639
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,400
aggregate value but again you're just

640
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,440
working on the partial data so you're

641
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,799
not learning anything and then you could

642
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,320
take the aggregate so like say for

643
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,760
instance you want the sum you've got a

644
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,440
partial sum and then you take each

645
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,799
partial sum and you put them together

646
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,440
and you get the final output and so

647
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,360
the key point here is that you can do

648
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,520
all this work um you know without ever

649
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,200
having anybody see any anybody's

650
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,840
individual value

651
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,320
um so let me just pause for a second

652
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,159
before i talk about the crypto which is

653
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,840
the trust model um because this is like

654
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,960
really important i know this comes up a

655
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,520
lot we talk about these systems so um

656
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,679
the client's requirement is the two

657
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,919
servers do not collude um if it's a

658
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,840
service clue they can be digital values

659
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,640
and it's game over right um and

660
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,799
um so

661
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,400
um that's very hard to operate between

662
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,159
people obviously and the client has to

663
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,960
trust exactly one of them um the client

664
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,159
is great the client trusts both but as

665
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,600
long as one of them doesn't cheat it's

666
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,280
fine and you can do end servers but two

667
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,960
is the most common number obviously the

668
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,799
servers also have to for various reasons

669
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,000
to do a little bit of enforcement about

670
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,440
like minimum batch sizes and query

671
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,280
limits and stuff like that to avoid some

672
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,440
attacks that we will talk about here um

673
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,960
for the collector's requirement both

674
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,400
servers have to actually be executed

675
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,000
protocol correctly because either server

676
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,280
can like distort the results that they

677
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,200
don't but again this is only a

678
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,600
correctness requirement um that only one

679
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,720
server is required to behave correctly

680
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,960
from the client's perspective um

681
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
so i just want to recognize right up

682
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,559
front it's like difficult to verify from

683
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,600
the client's perspective that the

684
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,840
servers are colliding um that conclusion

685
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,919
could happen through side channels um

686
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,120
uh depending on the architecture

687
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,880
sometimes it's the sideshows are small

688
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,640
signs they're big um you can do point in

689
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,080
time on this to verify that someone is

690
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,880
behaving correctly um but you can't uh

691
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,480
but it's like not possible you're not

692
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,400
colluding um and i just want to like so

693
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
i want to highlight that um but i also

694
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,679
want to say that like this is like a

695
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,960
very very common scenario on the

696
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,720
internet where you where people have

697
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,000
data and you have to trust and behave

698
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,679
correctly i mean if you think about like

699
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,520
you know your data is in gmail like you

700
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,880
know google has like your entire email

701
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,000
record right and your questions and

702
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,640
behave correctly um and you know even

703
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,760
you know even if the server's running on

704
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,280
your machine like

705
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,200
uh you know um generally people think of

706
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,720
that as behaving correctly but like your

707
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,159
ability to verify the software running

708
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,159
on your device extraordinary limited and

709
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,520
so like

710
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,960
wallaby wallace it'd be great to have a

711
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,080
situation in which we never had to trust

712
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,520
anybody that's simply not the situation

713
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,960
most of us find ourselves in so we're

714
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,520
talking about here is trying to like

715
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,039
alleviate the situations trust people

716
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:17,919
and make the number of people have the

717
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,679
trust smaller or the number of people

718
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,760
have to cheat larger i guess um we're

719
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,880
not talking about a limiting trust

720
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,480
entirely it's not possible the state and

721
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,559
our technological development and so

722
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,600
we're trying to improve the situation

723
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,640
but we're not trying to like boil the

724
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,799
ocean

725
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:31,679
um

726
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:32,480
so

727
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,240
um i want to talk very briefly about

728
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,840
like one cryptographic protocol to give

729
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,520
you a sense of like the situation um

730
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,039
this is sort of the one that started it

731
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,960
off it's called prio um and it's useful

732
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,720
for computing like numeric aggregates

733
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,799
like sum and mean that kind of thing and

734
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,000
like this is like the one that's the

735
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,159
most apprehensible um and like we're

736
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,760
gonna punt the crypto to cfrg but this

737
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,039
one is like understandable like normal

738
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,440
humans so we assume each client has some

739
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,120
value that's in the numeric value and

740
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,960
like called x of i right and so the

741
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,320
client does is the client splits up that

742
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,640
value in the following way it generates

743
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,400
a random value um

744
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,760
sorry about the fancy math but basically

745
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,840
a random value is smaller than a prime

746
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,679
and then it basically does it sends

747
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,919
server one like the value minus the

748
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,240
random value module of the prime and it

749
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,400
sends server to the random value it's

750
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,679
like it's quite easy to convince

751
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,480
yourself that if you know that oh no the

752
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,400
random value is not enough and knowing

753
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,480
uh and knowing um that the the

754
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,919
subtraction is not enough and that is

755
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,840
sufficient so now each server takes all

756
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,360
the shares i get from everybody and they

757
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,840
add them up right um and again like

758
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,279
because because because because these

759
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,400
are like information theoretically

760
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,679
they're allowing anything

761
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,039
and then they and then they basically

762
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,279
exchange the exchange the sums or really

763
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,039
like one sentence on the other probably

764
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,720
and then if you take the sums you add

765
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,480
them up um and you like do a bunch of

766
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,240
like much like relatively simple like

767
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
you know middle school math you could

768
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,520
just convince yourself because addition

769
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,039
is commutative that when you add the

770
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,159
sums up you actually get some of the

771
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,600
initial values

772
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,159
um so admission accomplished which all

773
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,360
this all this computation is zero

774
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,559
knowledge and we have the output at the

775
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,559
end

776
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,440
um

777
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,600
so this is like this seems like really

778
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,480
boring and like kind of obvious um and

779
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,240
but it's actually fantastically powerful

780
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,919
and the reason is because there's a lot

781
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,279
of things you can actually compute with

782
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,960
just this something as long as you

783
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,880
encode the data properly you can compute

784
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,320
all kinds of things as sums so like

785
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,760
arithmetic mean is obvious that sum

786
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,840
divided by count product you compute

787
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,760
product by doing some logs geometric

788
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,520
means coming from product you can do

789
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,559
variance and standard deviation by

790
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,159
computing some some of the values of the

791
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,679
squares there's a button there's a bunch

792
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,840
of fancy stuff for doing like or and mid

793
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,200
max and even ordinary obviously these

794
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,640
squares so the trigger is just finding

795
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,159
the writing coding and there's like

796
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,440
papers now about how to do all this

797
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,200
stuff

798
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,320
um

799
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,440
so

800
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,640
one problem that people really say is

801
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,159
like what about bogus data right and

802
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,360
there are actually two kinds of focus

803
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,919
data there's plausible data but it's

804
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,760
actually false so like i'm like about

805
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,440
175 centimeters tall but maybe i save

806
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,679
180 right um this is like a problem with

807
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,039
any surveying technique unless you can

808
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,720
date yourself and you just live with it

809
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,000
you just live with the noisy data right

810
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
because people don't lie consistently um

811
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,120
and then there's like consistent

812
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,799
completely ridiculous data or i like say

813
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,960
like i'm a kilometer tall or worse i say

814
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,799
like i'm negative kilometer tall right

815
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,960
and ordinarily what you do is you just

816
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
like have some filter mechanism

817
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,760
where

818
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,279
you said um you know uh you just said

819
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,600
like well i i i just rejected anything

820
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,200
this is a kilometer tall right and but

821
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,640
like with the pre-it is encrypted you

822
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,360
can't do that right and so

823
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,559
um

824
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,360
uh um and so instead what you do is like

825
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,880
and this is the fancy math part each

826
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,159
submission comes with a zero knowledge

827
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,760
proof of validity and the proof says

828
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,200
something like this height report is

829
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,039
like between like 100 and 200

830
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,640
centimeters right the servers work

831
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,320
together value the proof and you only

832
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,360
aggregate the submissions that have

833
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,120
ballot proofs right so like you've got

834
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,960
to trust me this part works but like um

835
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,799
this part works um

836
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,000
um but it's important to remember that

837
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,760
this part believing this part works does

838
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,840
not we're not necessarily required for

839
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,360
bullying privacy the privacy claim costs

840
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,039
the previous things um uh that the

841
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,080
youtube videos don't pick the data

842
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
um

843
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,520
so okay so like going back to my use

844
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,240
cases right um uh say i want to collect

845
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,679
these user interests right so basically

846
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,880
what you call user interesting thing

847
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,960
like preo is that every user interest is

848
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,400
a bucket and you have like i don't know

849
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,200
100 200 500 buckets right and the client

850
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,559
individually reports time spent in each

851
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,919
bucket you have to report the ones that

852
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,279
are zero too by the way otherwise you

853
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,159
can just look at which buckets are

854
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,159
reported and then use prior sum up and

855
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,760
end up with a bunch of sums one for each

856
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,000
bucket and now you know exactly how much

857
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,760
your time was spent on each bucket for

858
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,960
each pocket but you don't anybody's

859
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,440
individual time spent um and as i know

860
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,600
you can always you can also um

861
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,760
uh um report t squared you could be

862
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
standard vision as well so um this is

863
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,480
like a pretty straightforward

864
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,559
application or something

865
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,320
but there's like a whole pile of use

866
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,240
cases that basically come into this

867
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,279
um

868
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,720
okay um

869
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,559
so um

870
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,559
even more fancy is a protocol um called

871
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,320
heavy hitters um well actually they

872
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,440
didn't name it so like we've been

873
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,720
calling it hits um and the idea so the

874
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,320
idea is that like each client submits a

875
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,640
string um like a url and you want to

876
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,960
output the end most frequent strings and

877
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,559
i'm going to like very very aggressively

878
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,880
handle this but the basic idea is that

879
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,559
the servers can join you compute the

880
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,159
number of strings that any given prefix

881
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,159
p and so what you do is you start with

882
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,159
like basically you just do binary search

883
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,480
so you start with like strings start

884
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,760
with zero and you say how many strings

885
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,240
are zero or start with one and then okay

886
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,840
fine now i'll keep going down the tree

887
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,039
until i've gotten down to whatever

888
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,360
threshold i want to and so you can just

889
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,360
just find all the values and effects

890
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,799
all the important values in basically

891
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,120
log n tries um and i will not even

892
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,240
remotely attempt to explain how this

893
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,640
works um i you know i understood it for

894
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,679
the amount of time i understood quantum

895
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,399
physics when i was in college um um so

896
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,080
but like um again this is like well

897
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,679
understood math at this point

898
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:36,799
um

899
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,720
so going back to my use cases again this

900
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,760
you can just have to like this for

901
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,760
conducting broken sites right each

902
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,279
client creates one report for each type

903
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,880
who's broken or which is fingerprinting

904
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,559
and they use his determinants of sites

905
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,159
and it's just and the servers just spit

906
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,679
out the list of all the important sites

907
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,960
but you don't learn who reported them

908
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,080
and you don't know not any sites that

909
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,120
aren't important because the servers

910
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,640
just won't just in the tree once the

911
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,000
cardinality is full a certain byte

912
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,679
so um so again this is like an example

913
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:00,720
how you can use this for like a real

914
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,080
world application like we actually

915
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,840
really care about

916
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,080
um

917
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,640
so um

918
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,159
i i do one thing i wanna like flag is um

919
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,840
that there um is a

920
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,880
this is the issue of course called

921
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,919
subset query um which is um

922
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,360
uh that

923
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,120
so submissions could i just giving you

924
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,480
examples or something we're just giving

925
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,000
you submissions that like have one piece

926
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,600
of information but you can also tag the

927
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,039
submissions of the demographic data

928
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,159
because like birthdayers or credit

929
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,440
results and these are talking about

930
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,279
right and those get passed on all the

931
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,760
way to the aggregators right and this is

932
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,360
like this is emotionally safe because

933
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
you say that the non nonsense

934
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,159
information is safe or you you only

935
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,399
click on this information and then

936
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,919
they owed it as encrypted but then you

937
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,440
can say okay computer i get over the

938
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,039
subsets um

939
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,399
so that's like a very powerful today

940
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,480
that's one reason why this is like a

941
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,679
powerful technique and ways that like

942
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,159
ohio is not um but of course it means

943
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,440
that repeated queries can be used to

944
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,360
determine values by like querying for

945
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,720
the subset like includes them and then

946
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,799
excludes them um there's defenses

947
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,880
against this um having minimum batch

948
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,200
sizes anti-replay um randomization for

949
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,880
differential privacy um this is a piece

950
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,399
of work the working groups have to work

951
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,679
on as part of why this is completely

952
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,679
done but i think we'll understand how to

953
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,840
do pieces of this um for for some some

954
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,039
measurements and then other ones that

955
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,120
you need some more

956
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,159
um

957
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,360
so what is the state of the play here um

958
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,880
a number of us um some of the people

959
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,480
you're representing have basically

960
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,679
developed a generic protocol um that is

961
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:26,880
designed for doing privacy pure

962
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,279
measurement uh what i mean by generic is

963
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,840
that um it's a framework protocol that

964
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,159
then you can plug in um

965
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,679
uh you know individual cryptographic

966
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,559
technologies um so it's compatible with

967
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,679
the basic what these things called

968
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,679
verifiable should be variation functions

969
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,320
which we'll be talking about um but um

970
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,000
initially it's tuned to work without

971
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,640
preo and heavy hitters um it's built on

972
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,399
top of https it's going to smell a lot

973
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,919
like you know any rest kind of protocol

974
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,520
like acme or whatever you've seen before

975
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,039
that's what's easy to implement with

976
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,799
physical services infrastructure and

977
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,240
about a number of people working on this

978
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,320
like um you know having work from

979
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,679
regular infrastructure to design and

980
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,000
work well with this um so yeah um

981
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,440
um so let me just give you like system

982
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,640
architecture picture um that's what it

983
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,919
looks like you know there's a bunch of

984
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,519
clients they send their shares and then

985
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,519
there's like a leader and and um the

986
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,200
leader like basically takes the shares

987
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,880
and parcels about the helpers and

988
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,559
orchestrates the whole computation and

989
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,000
then the data is like sent to a

990
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,600
collector as the clutch because i look

991
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,200
give me like the output for this this

992
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,120
subset of the system um and then it

993
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,720
splits the results out right and so one

994
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,880
way to think about this um i think

995
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,240
there's a number of playing modes

996
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,039
compatible with one of which is that you

997
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,200
know the collector and the leader are

998
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,120
the same person and they're trying to do

999
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,320
it the data collection and they

1000
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,760
outsource the helper job to one other

1001
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,679
person so that they can make guarantees

1002
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,600
about the privacy of the system um

1003
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,360
another possibility is the whole is a

1004
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,279
whole like leader collector

1005
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,279
helper box is like a service that's

1006
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,440
provided people um

1007
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,720
the trust model here you should be

1008
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,120
assuming is that the clients have to

1009
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,519
know what the helpers later are and so

1010
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,840
the clients know who the who the data is

1011
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,360
being encrypted for and so they can make

1012
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,279
their own assessment of whether or not

1013
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,440
they trust one of those people um though

1014
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,640
of course in a real world scenario

1015
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,720
what's most likely to happen is that the

1016
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,320
clients are deployed by some by the

1017
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,679
collector effectively and the collector

1018
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,840
hardwires the leader and helper and so

1019
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,159
the the user of the service can inspect

1020
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,840
who those people are but it's not like

1021
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,799
to actually choose them in any

1022
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,320
meaningful way

1023
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,559
um

1024
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
so um you know people are actually going

1025
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,240
to ask like what like the situation of

1026
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,000
ill-high is um because oh hi as i

1027
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,440
mentioned is useful for many of these

1028
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,200
kinds of settings um these are

1029
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,600
complements and not substitutes so um

1030
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,000
you know good cases for ohi are like as

1031
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,600
i say sort of standing sensitive data

1032
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,960
this will kind of rich freeform data

1033
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,640
that like you couldn't really you know

1034
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,039
aggregate this way um um anything of

1035
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,399
course it needs any kind of responsible

1036
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,360
right because like none of this

1037
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,960
technology gets your response it just

1038
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,360
measures um good cases for ppm are like

1039
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,279
really sensitive data um

1040
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,039
hopefully simpler data because like as

1041
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,480
you sort of find any idea it's not like

1042
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,679
really easy to like do very complicated

1043
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,679
stuff um and settings where you just

1044
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,440
kind of do drill down you do regression

1045
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,679
or you do do subset correspondence icons

1046
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,080
and things um um so like these are like

1047
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,600
you know these are two great hits that

1048
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,960
tastes great together right you can use

1049
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,720
ohio to talk to ppm server that's like

1050
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,320
boosting the privacy of the system so

1051
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,919
like you say okay well i do want to

1052
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,039
collect this data but i actually store

1053
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,320
an ip address so you can remove that as

1054
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,799
well um and

1055
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,880
so um in fact i think you'll see you'll

1056
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,760
see some of the um uh some of that like

1057
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,640
later talks um you can also use um uh

1058
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,960
sort of a front-end proxy server um to

1059
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,760
do a bunch of like um you know kind of

1060
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,919
misuse detection of like you know

1061
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,760
spamming attacks and stuff like that so

1062
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,440
um so i think these are complementary

1063
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,360
techniques not but not not competitive

1064
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,320
which is why you see some of the same

1065
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,159
people working on them

1066
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,559
um i don't know why oh yeah right um i

1067
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,000
was like why do i have two more slides

1068
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,919
so i'm now done i think i hit my target

1069
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,760
time target quite well um i have a

1070
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,960
little time for questions which i'd be

1071
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,279
happy to take

1072
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
oh i do want to say one more thing um

1073
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,919
but while i'm waiting to see if anybody

1074
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:00,960
will say anything which is our

1075
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,480
assumption is the vdf functions we

1076
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,519
standardized or defined in cfrg not an

1077
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,360
itf and so the idea is we'll build the

1078
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,839
framework here and we'll defer the work

1079
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,760
of defining the v dash to cfrg and that

1080
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,560
work is already probably going on or is

1081
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
being presented as a4g

1082
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,560
west

1083
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,918
boss thanks uh good presentation i

1084
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,760
enjoyed um

1085
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,440
you laid it out really well the one

1086
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,879
thing that i'd like to hear more about

1087
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,639
is sort of the deployment scenario for

1088
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,960
example on slide 14 don't go back you

1089
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,879
you specifically said the client wants

1090
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,839
to report some value right so

1091
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,440
would your expectation be that uh

1092
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,599
application authors and and servers

1093
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,040
would sort of make use of the same way

1094
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,800
that sort of ohio is considering being

1095
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,399
deployed by you know various

1096
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,040
organizations to get into stuff or that

1097
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,280
you know doe is being used for if for

1098
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,679
everything you know dns i mean

1099
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,960
how do you

1100
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,320
where would this be deployed because the

1101
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,040
client actually if the client is a user

1102
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,880
right they're clueless so yeah

1103
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,720
absolutely yeah i think so i think i

1104
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,400
think the most likely settings for this

1105
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,119
initially will be the kind of like

1106
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,880
um kind of measurements that like people

1107
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,320
are already taking via the software

1108
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,800
disseminate so um you know

1109
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,200
things like browser telemetry um uh you

1110
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,480
know um

1111
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,359
uh i think um the the case of the case

1112
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,280
of the the um uh tim what we're talking

1113
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,960
about next involves um measurement of

1114
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,280
cover exposures um and yeah those things

1115
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,960
are all being done like sort of sort of

1116
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,480
like um you know

1117
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,560
automatically um you know potentially by

1118
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,000
asking these are automatically by the

1119
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,200
software i think there's some

1120
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
possibility that in the future um you

1121
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,560
know you'd see like this views for

1122
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,160
surveying for direct surveying where you

1123
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,440
say okay you know are you willing to

1124
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,119
participate in surveys and then we'll

1125
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,960
walk down to the client and you can do

1126
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,760
it but i mean like you know the the uh

1127
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,359
yeah i mean i think yeah you know these

1128
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,880
are these are pull techniques not push

1129
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,720
techniques fundamentally um

1130
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,000
um and i think you know obviously

1131
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,280
cryptographically it's so complicated

1132
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,640
that the user has to involve some pieces

1133
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,839
of software to do it

1134
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,560
do you have a use case today that that

1135
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,640
should not be used with ohio that this

1136
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,000
would be a better for that's like

1137
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,760
already in your head for you know i want

1138
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,880
this now

1139
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,760
yeah yeah um so i think so i think uh um

1140
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,280
the uh cert so certainly the um

1141
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,200
uh the the use case of measuring sort of

1142
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,960
misbehaving websites um it basically

1143
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,880
cannot be kind of be contained with ohio

1144
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,200
because you um because you learn the uh

1145
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,560
um

1146
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,320
you learn a bunch of the uh you don't

1147
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,599
want to learn any little cardinality

1148
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,880
sites those those are very dangerous

1149
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,160
right um because if you like collect

1150
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,920
like every url from what it goes to if

1151
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,599
this is behaving um then there's a real

1152
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,800
probability that you learn a bunch of

1153
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,040
like say google docs um you know

1154
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,359
capability urls or you learn you know

1155
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,280
you know some document quality this is

1156
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,440
like my plan to buy company a you know

1157
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,560
um um so yeah so it's basically like

1158
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,920
anything involves that that kind of like

1159
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,800
string data collection is very

1160
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,119
problematic without high um also even

1161
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,520
like the cert this sort of bucketized um

1162
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,240
you know uh um you know give me counters

1163
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,680
that would be 80 80 counters like really

1164
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,599
problematic with the high um because

1165
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,880
basically if you decide to get every

1166
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,480
single value and report it separately

1167
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,240
otherwise you end up a situation where

1168
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,440
you can build these high dimensional

1169
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,960
data sets and use them to to do

1170
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,640
production so like those are both cases

1171
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,520
where all hype does not perform

1172
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,800
particularly well though the second like

1173
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,320
you could maybe get away with but it's

1174
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,119
probably problematic

1175
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,680
andrew

1176
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,400
just by way of clarity since ohio has

1177
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,720
come up quite a lot uh um in the chat

1178
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,520
with the new presentation um uh where

1179
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,800
you said complimentary there's no

1180
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,160
dependency

1181
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,119
uh

1182
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,280
yeah yeah that's what i thought it was

1183
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,839
just being

1184
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,720
absolutely no not at all thank you

1185
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,480
okay chairs i i i'll hang around but

1186
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,480
like i think then we're done right

1187
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,800
yes thank you very much um

1188
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,640
so just for avoidance of confusion the

1189
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,400
the mozilla use cases revolted into

1190
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,000
accuracy that's correct yes the case i

1191
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,960
mean i didn't cover everything we're

1192
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,640
just doing but those two things we're

1193
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,680
doing yes

1194
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,320
right so we're going to roll into uh tim

1195
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,760
now

1196
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,440
if you go ahead and grab the slides

1197
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,839
excellent

1198
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,520
oh the song slides

1199
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,280
oh i thought excuse me i thought you

1200
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,480
were going to

1201
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,880
uh put the slides up

1202
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,800
uh i can i can run them if you want me

1203
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,960
to or would you i'm not sure how to

1204
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,560
upload them in miner nice and simple

1205
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,079
anyway

1206
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,359
thank you

1207
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,119
um okay i'll

1208
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,440
okay i didn't need to release oh i've

1209
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,560
got it there we go

1210
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,760
all right thank you

1211
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,839
okay so let's get started uh my name is

1212
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,680
tim and i'm an engineer at the internet

1213
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,359
security research group uh we're the

1214
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,040
non-profit that

1215
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,560
operates the let's encrypt certificate

1216
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,760
authority

1217
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,800
um

1218
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,720
not to be confused with the irs g

1219
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,960
incidentally uh the dilemma that mr

1220
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,880
riskorla just introduced in which the

1221
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,240
essential function of gathering

1222
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,920
telemetry from the field introduces

1223
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,160
significant privacy risks for users is

1224
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,400
of great interest to the isrg uh given

1225
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,000
our mission of reducing barriers to

1226
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,920
secure and private communications on the

1227
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,040
internet

1228
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,880
um next slide please

1229
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,839
so ecker covered that uh you know the

1230
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,119
ways in which telemetry is a privacy

1231
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,720
risk for users and the you know the

1232
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,200
implied value benefits to users of um

1233
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,960
using these new technologies but i think

1234
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,480
it's worth noting that many data

1235
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,400
collectors also want to do the right

1236
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,000
thing and respect the privacy of their

1237
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,839
users besides that being a decent thing

1238
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,680
to do the large amount of personal

1239
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,680
identifying information stored by

1240
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,440
conventional telemetry systems is a

1241
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,839
significant liability for the data

1242
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:28,720
collector there's new privacy

1243
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,000
regulations emerging in various

1244
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,320
jurisdictions all the time which require

1245
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,760
expensive and complicated controls

1246
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,760
around user data

1247
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,520
and all that pii makes for a very very

1248
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,880
tempting target for attackers

1249
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,040
so we have these new tools like prio and

1250
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,119
heavy hitters but uh even those

1251
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,800
organizations with pretty formidable

1252
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,160
engineering departments who have the

1253
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,000
wherewithal to explore these techniques

1254
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,920
are in kind of a jam because you need an

1255
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,920
external trusted partner to execute

1256
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,440
these multi-party protocols um so isrg

1257
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
is interested in providing private

1258
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,880
measurement aggregation as a public

1259
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,400
service to the internet for a lot of the

1260
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,319
same reasons that we built let's encrypt

1261
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,000
we want to make it easy to do the right

1262
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,359
thing

1263
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,839
next slide please

1264
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,839
so we envision running a standards

1265
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,920
compliant aggregator as a service uh

1266
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,079
with the same focus on automation and

1267
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,599
use of integration that drive let's

1268
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,560
encrypt

1269
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,480
we expect that

1270
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,839
some customers will want to run their

1271
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,359
own aggregator and have it work with

1272
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,040
hours but others will want to avoid

1273
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,960
running any servers at all and will

1274
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,560
instead choose two existing aggregators

1275
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,040
say one run by isrg and one run by some

1276
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,800
other organization or a company that

1277
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,960
chooses to participate

1278
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,960
um so

1279
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,800
in support of that we we are

1280
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,160
hoping to provide an open source

1281
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,520
implementation of a ppm aggregator with

1282
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,680
the aim of making it easy for some data

1283
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,000
collector to interoperate with isr use

1284
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,400
aggregator or anybody else's so

1285
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,480
hopefully uh it ends up being a matter

1286
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,079
of grabbing a container image from some

1287
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,079
public registry you deploy it into your

1288
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,760
existing you know kubernetes cluster or

1289
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,599
whatever you have and you can start

1290
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,359
gathering private telemetry cheaply and

1291
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,079
easily um somewhat akin to how the eff

1292
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,839
cert bot can be easily deployed

1293
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,640
alongside your existing web server um to

1294
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,000
have it manage let's encrypt tls

1295
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,839
certificates

1296
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,119
we are also

1297
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,119
aiming to provide open source client

1298
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,040
libraries targeting like a variety of

1299
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,480
languages and frameworks

1300
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,160
uh chosen to you know facilitate

1301
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,839
adoption for the most likely interested

1302
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,440
parties so you know you can imagine like

1303
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,000
a swift sdk for ios apps uh javascript

1304
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,760
for web app for a single page

1305
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,440
application on the web

1306
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,520
and so on

1307
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,400
um so right so with this goal in mind uh

1308
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,200
an open standard through the ietf is uh

1309
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,440
acutely valuable because a proprietary

1310
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,040
single vendor solution wouldn't be

1311
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,720
terribly useful since the privacy

1312
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,240
guarantees are contingent upon

1313
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,079
independent and non-colluding

1314
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,079
aggregators

1315
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,400
um next slide please

1316
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,520
thank you

1317
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,319
so

1318
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,680
we talked a lot about you know the

1319
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,760
benefits of these new technologies but

1320
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,599
uh there are some trade-offs some

1321
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,680
drawbacks to these systems so for one

1322
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,440
thing there are more servers involved so

1323
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,839
it's more likely more likely to fail

1324
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,160
somewhat necessarily second the

1325
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,000
verification of the proofs that uh

1326
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,319
introduced earlier um do introduce some

1327
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,839
computational network overhead and in

1328
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,680
particular we'll introduce depending on

1329
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,079
which which uh protocol which vdaf is in

1330
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,319
use will introduce uh potentially

1331
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,760
multiple rounds of communication between

1332
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,760
the aggregating servers

1333
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,079
uh finally um

1334
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,880
metrics gathered under these schemes are

1335
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,000
these skins are necessarily less

1336
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,839
flexible than conventional telemetry

1337
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,079
systems uh you can't make arbitrary

1338
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,000
post-hoc queries sorry you can't make

1339
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,680
arbitrary queries post-hoc against your

1340
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,359
your corpus of data

1341
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,599
um you have to know up front before you

1342
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,440
begin collecting any data what are the

1343
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,440
aggregations you're interested in

1344
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,119
computing this has to do with the

1345
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,359
construction of the proofs um

1346
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,040
as well as enforcing some of the privacy

1347
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,880
guarantees of the system

1348
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,720
um fortunately you know in spite of all

1349
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,079
these challenges we do have some

1350
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,680
evidence that this stuff actually works

1351
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,040
and at scale

1352
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,280
so in december of 2020

1353
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,240
a collaboration between apple google uh

1354
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,240
we at the isrg the linux foundation

1355
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,760
public health initiative the mitre

1356
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,599
corporation and the national cancer

1357
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,280
institute at the national institutes of

1358
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,720
health um

1359
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,400
in the united states

1360
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,720
uh launched the exposure notifications

1361
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,119
private analytics system um and this is

1362
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,119
the back end to apple and google's

1363
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,760
exposure notifications express

1364
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,760
um which is a system of course for cove

1365
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,599
exposure notifications

1366
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,040
so

1367
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:29,920
uh

1368
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,920
so en explorer verifications of course

1369
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,839
is the system by which a mobile devices

1370
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,839
can uh sort of anonymously exchange with

1371
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,119
each other to a

1372
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,920
cova exposure enpa allows back

1373
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,760
anonymously and privately back hauling

1374
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,359
that data to your regional public health

1375
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,720
authority so that they can get

1376
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,240
information on how many people are

1377
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,599
getting the notifications how many

1378
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,440
people are on their mobile devices how

1379
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,920
many people are interacting with them uh

1380
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,520
and all sorts of interesting metrics

1381
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,599
about the spread of covet itself as well

1382
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,000
as the effectiveness of the

1383
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,599
of the en system

1384
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,680
so this is currently deployed in 13 u.s

1385
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,160
states and the district of columbia

1386
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,760
and at the moment it's gathering 2.1

1387
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,839
million measurements per hour uh we also

1388
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,839
heard last night to throw in one more

1389
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,240
interesting number that uh sometime over

1390
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,119
the night we gathered uh 12 billion

1391
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,319
individual

1392
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,680
metrics that have been aggregated since

1393
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,760
the system launched

1394
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,599
um we're also about to deploy this

1395
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,920
internationally so uh

1396
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,760
beyond the united states so we're hoping

1397
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,839
to soon turn this on in uh uh four

1398
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,720
states in mexico okay i'm already well

1399
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,440
over time so i will see the floor thank

1400
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,319
you

1401
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,960
thank you very much tim all right uh

1402
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,560
martin you're up next

1403
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,760
do you want to run your slides you want

1404
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,079
me to

1405
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,040
we can't hear you martin next

1406
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,640
that was kind of broken up

1407
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,760
i

1408
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,960
am sorry

1409
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,520
is that coming through better now or we

1410
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,400
i can hear you now yes thanks yeah it

1411
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,160
takes some time

1412
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,200
uh where are we

1413
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,079
i have to thank the people who provided

1414
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,920
the preview on selecting their slides

1415
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,119
because all of these slides have the

1416
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,760
same titles

1417
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,079
okay so um i'm going to talk very

1418
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,839
briefly about some of the

1419
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,760
use cases in advertising specifically

1420
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,920
the conversion measurement one i think

1421
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,119
charlie's going to follow up with some

1422
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,400
more details

1423
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,280
on

1424
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,480
on this one so um conversion measurement

1425
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,200
is something that happens on the web

1426
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,319
quite a bit

1427
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,280
uh

1428
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,800
when when someone shows an advertisement

1429
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,960
it's kind of nice to know if that

1430
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,040
advertisement is having the intended

1431
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,079
effect

1432
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,680
and so the goal

1433
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,200
here is to

1434
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,400
measure

1435
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,040
how many people

1436
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,760
buy the widget when they saw the ad

1437
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,359
and how many by how many people buy the

1438
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,200
widget without seeing the ad how many

1439
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,319
people see the ad without buying the

1440
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,000
widget all those sorts of things

1441
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,079
um and

1442
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,240
combinations of those things for

1443
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,680
different uh campaigns and whatnot

1444
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,680
uh this information flows to both the

1445
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,480
advertisers the ad tech companies and

1446
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,040
those people who who actually sell the

1447
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,760
inventory or put the advertisements on

1448
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,400
their websites

1449
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,839
so

1450
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,839
key question here is is the money i'm

1451
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,280
spending on all this advertising

1452
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,040
actually having an effect

1453
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,800
on me making more money

1454
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,560
so the way this works today is pretty

1455
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,680
simple

1456
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,040
uh we assign a

1457
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,880
user an identifier so everyone gets

1458
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,440
their own unique identifier and every

1459
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,440
time they visit a website and an

1460
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,040
advertisement is shown or they do

1461
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,520
something then we just create a little

1462
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,920
little log record that records all the

1463
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,079
details from the context and the user

1464
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,240
identifier time stamps all those sorts

1465
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,599
of other things

1466
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,240
and then you look at the log

1467
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,920
and you can answer all sorts of

1468
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,880
questions about what people have done

1469
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,960
it's um it's really great for getting

1470
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,560
the information that you need it's all

1471
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,960
quite precise and leaving aside all of

1472
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,599
the complications of anti-fraud and all

1473
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,119
those sorts of other things you can

1474
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,119
answer all the questions that you have

1475
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,079
fairly precisely

1476
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,280
however

1477
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,480
that

1478
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,200
doesn't really respect people's privacy

1479
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,880
and so the idea behind some of the

1480
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,240
efforts

1481
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,599
that we're talking about here is to

1482
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,599
produce aggregate statistics about

1483
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:44,960
conversions

1484
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,160
without relying on user specific

1485
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,599
logs

1486
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,640
that means you get counts rather than

1487
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,598
individual records

1488
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,839
uh the current status of this work is

1489
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:58,559
that there's lots and lots of

1490
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,960
requirements that are coming through

1491
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,000
this is

1492
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,720
obviously a lot more complicated when it

1493
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,480
comes into practice there's lots of

1494
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,200
ideas people have all sorts of wonderful

1495
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,640
proposals

1496
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,480
and uh some competing requirements but

1497
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,200
uh

1498
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,119
a lot of the really promising ideas

1499
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,040
include something like what echo

1500
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,839
described earlier

1501
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,040
and the simple example here

1502
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,119
is probably the one that is easiest to

1503
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,119
understand you have an event that occurs

1504
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,200
someone views an ad

1505
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,599
you have a

1506
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,839
another event that occurs they buy an

1507
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,480
item as maybe that's connected to that

1508
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,160
particular ad and those are two of

1509
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,520
independent events and you can

1510
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,599
imagine those events going into some

1511
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,920
sort of opaque box that's operated by

1512
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,440
say their browser

1513
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,920
or something like that

1514
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,079
and

1515
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:57,520
you

1516
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,480
add up some numbers and maybe you add up

1517
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,599
a one

1518
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,480
if there was an ad shown and the person

1519
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,160
bought the thing

1520
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,319
and if there was no ad shown you add up

1521
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,480
a zero you get those reports from

1522
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,040
thousands and thousands of people

1523
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,440
and feed them through a system

1524
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,920
like brio or one of those other things

1525
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,839
and you get back a count of the number

1526
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,520
of people who

1527
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,240
saw the ad and bought the product

1528
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,079
and that allows you to make some

1529
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,000
uh conclusions about how you how your

1530
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,200
business has been operating in the

1531
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,599
advertising campaigns you're running

1532
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,040
obviously this gets a lot more

1533
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,520
complicated but uh we'll let charlie

1534
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,720
explain some of that

1535
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,520
any questions on this part

1536
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,559
okay so is that is that the end of your

1537
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,559
presentation

1538
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,559
that is it

1539
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:06,640
okay let's go ahead and bring uh charlie

1540
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,559
on then charlie do you want me to do

1541
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,720
your slides you want to run them

1542
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:15,359
uh i think i can run them let me see

1543
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,319
ask to share slides

1544
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,640
and

1545
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:22,960
let's see if this works

1546
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,640
great you guys can see it

1547
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,520
yep

1548
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,040
okay great

1549
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,760
hello everyone uh my name is charlie

1550
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,000
harrison i'm a software engineer working

1551
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,200
at google

1552
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,079
uh

1553
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,440
looking at ppm like solutions for doing

1554
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,200
ads measurement on the web

1555
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,160
uh to satisfy similar use cases that

1556
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,559
martin was just talking about

1557
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:45,440
um

1558
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,079
so i'll kind of breeze through some of

1559
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,440
the background just because there's a

1560
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,680
lot of overlaps with martin's slide but

1561
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,559
i i think the gist here is that

1562
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,160
here at google

1563
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,240
we think third-party cookies are not

1564
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,520
great for users uh users privacy

1565
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,319
um

1566
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:03,520
but

1567
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,839
they're kind of right now like critical

1568
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,720
infrastructure that powers online ads

1569
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,680
um

1570
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,720
for exactly the reason martin mentioned

1571
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,839
and the

1572
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,359
the problem that we're trying to kind of

1573
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,319
grapple with is whether we can build

1574
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,240
something like a third party cookie

1575
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,119
alternative that gives users good

1576
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,240
privacy

1577
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,240
while still kind of supporting this like

1578
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,280
critical infrastructure to some extent

1579
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,240
um and i think the key insight here uh

1580
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,359
is that um at least as it relates to ppm

1581
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,280
is that like many ads use cases are

1582
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,119
actually like totally fine with

1583
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,599
aggregate data and they don't actually

1584
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,000
need to track you kind of around the web

1585
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,880
and learn all the data exactly

1586
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,119
um we we could be fine with aggregate

1587
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,440
data in many cases

1588
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,000
uh so i i want to go over just in a

1589
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,160
little bit more detail how attribution

1590
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,760
measurement which is also called

1591
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,839
conversion measurement um

1592
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,720
happens today with cookies essentially

1593
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,319
uh and i'm sure this is gonna be

1594
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,040
familiar for many people uh what happens

1595
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,440
is that you typically have an ad tech

1596
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,599
uh site that is like running on a

1597
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,200
website and that drops cookies on

1598
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,359
uh sets cookies that are readable

1599
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,319
basically from anywhere from any website

1600
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:23,200
um this allows you basically to keep

1601
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,760
track of like a mega identifier sort of

1602
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,440
which is this third-party cookie which

1603
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,119
is uh

1604
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,680
tags the user or the user's device with

1605
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,760
an identifier which

1606
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,599
is readable from multiple different

1607
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,480
contexts so you'll read this cookie when

1608
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,960
an ad is placed and you'll also read

1609
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,640
this cookie when there's a conversion

1610
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,880
like when you buy something later on

1611
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,880
down the road after you've seen an ad

1612
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,520
for it uh and so right now this cookie

1613
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,319
id is used as the join key to join these

1614
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,800
two cross site events right

1615
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,680
um

1616
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,559
and but they they they join arbitrary

1617
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,720
events so like all of your browsing can

1618
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,559
be linked up to this one cookie in

1619
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:03,839
theory

1620
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,640
uh how could it be improved uh we could

1621
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,440
internally join this data in the browser

1622
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,920
um so when you see an ad we could

1623
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,839
register something in like custom new

1624
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:16,079
browser storage uh and when you buy

1625
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,160
something that was like pointed to by

1626
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,359
that ad

1627
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,520
that would join up with that with that

1628
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,839
event in the internal browser storage

1629
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:27,200
and you could uh have a communication

1630
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,760
path from the browser to something like

1631
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,280
ppm where we we you know we have this

1632
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,280
data we want to compute something like a

1633
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,839
histogram uh maybe we want to learn

1634
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,760
something like you know what are the

1635
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,359
accounts

1636
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:43,760
of conversions like purchases per ad

1637
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,319
campaign so the x-axis is that campaign

1638
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,240
the y-axis is the number of conversions

1639
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,880
we can we can use ppm to kind of uh

1640
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,520
generate a data data share split that

1641
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,000
encodes that histogram contribution send

1642
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,160
that up to ppm and the ad tech could uh

1643
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,319
learn aggregate statistics like just a

1644
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:07,599
histogram um of of the uh of the counts

1645
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,880
and this doesn't reveal any uh user data

1646
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,880
directly it only reveals aggregates

1647
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,760
um so there are a whole bunch of like

1648
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,559
cool use cases to think about um i know

1649
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,960
there's a lot of talk in the chat about

1650
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,839
differential privacy and this is a

1651
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,760
something some formal privacy that we

1652
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,079
could add within the ppm system to

1653
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,640
ensure that the output of ppm is private

1654
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,160
um so that's something we're looking

1655
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,040
into

1656
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,680
um there's a lot of interesting research

1657
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,280
that's related to kind of the heavy

1658
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,000
hitter stuff about how do we report

1659
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,760
these histograms when they're like

1660
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,680
really really really big like you are

1661
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,520
running millions of campaigns or you

1662
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,960
want to do like all sorts of different

1663
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,400
crosses

1664
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,000
um we're

1665
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,200
really interested in uh systems that can

1666
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,400
help train machine learning models um in

1667
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,960
some cases there's their results that

1668
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,119
show that even just aggregate histograms

1669
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:06,960
could be used to train like logistic

1670
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,480
models but like

1671
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,920
are like

1672
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,839
we're looking into more sophisticated

1673
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:13,200
mechanisms

1674
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,880
um

1675
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,319
there's uh

1676
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,160
you know in rather than conversion

1677
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,520
measurement we could look at reach

1678
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,359
measurement which is asking like how

1679
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,760
many distinct users saw my ad across

1680
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,760
many different websites so this is kind

1681
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,280
of like removing a

1682
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,000
like remove duplicates operation

1683
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,359
um and you know we we're

1684
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:35,359
we're interested in exploring like you

1685
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:36,559
know

1686
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:37,839
we have this conversion measurement

1687
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:39,520
thing but maybe there's something that's

1688
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,880
more generic

1689
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,440
um that we could use for

1690
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,839
like a more basic browser primitive

1691
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:50,079
uh and i think i think that's my time

1692
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,480
but uh yeah happy to answer questions

1693
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,839
after

1694
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:56,480
the uh everyone else is done

1695
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,839
thanks

1696
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:59,440
very much charlie so now that's the end

1697
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,079
of the uh the use case presentations so

1698
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:04,000
we're going to open the floor briefly to

1699
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,920
anyone who wants to ask about any of

1700
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:06,880
those

1701
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,119
use cases

1702
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,480
okay so i think we're going to go ahead

1703
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,799
and move on to richard now

1704
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:24,040
thank you

1705
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,680
so i sent a request to sure slides out

1706
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,000
there we go yeah

1707
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,140
there we go

1708
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,319
[Music]

1709
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,319
sure

1710
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,760
all right so yeah this is this is pretty

1711
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,079
different so uh ecker talked about

1712
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:52,640
protocol we had a couple talks about use

1713
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,880
cases um i'm here to talk about kind of

1714
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,319
the substrate

1715
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,599
um

1716
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,160
and the the label we are using for this

1717
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,400
is verifiable distributed aggregation

1718
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,000
functions thanks to chris patton for

1719
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,960
that uh that name

1720
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,440
context here is a like many things in

1721
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,599
the in the ietf we need some complicated

1722
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:13,280
crypto for this

1723
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,440
and so we're doing some parallel work in

1724
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:19,440
cfrg and it goes alongside the crypto

1725
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,599
the protocol work in the ietf

1726
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,720
to kind of uh to specify the the

1727
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,559
complicated crypto bits in a place where

1728
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,480
we can get cryptographers eyes on them

1729
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,880
as opposed to just protocol nerds um

1730
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,720
just highlighting some some parallels

1731
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,040
here uh tls depending on cryptographic

1732
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,839
primitives that cfrg defines mls relies

1733
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:40,559
on hpke which you did in cfrg and so for

1734
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,760
this ppm work we're defining this vdf uh

1735
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,359
or

1736
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:46,720
vdaf depending on how you want to

1737
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,599
pronounce it uh that defining this as

1738
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,839
the kind of cryptographic abstraction

1739
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:53,200
that um

1740
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,480
that ppm relies on in cfrg

1741
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,480
now if you look at the draft it's kind

1742
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,920
of in two parts we define an api

1743
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,079
that is the abstraction ppm is supposed

1744
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:05,920
to rely on so

1745
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,680
the idea is that we have multiple

1746
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,480
instantiations that do various flavors

1747
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,520
of this

1748
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,640
private aggregated measurement dance

1749
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,599
that all behave in a close enough way

1750
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:19,520
that we can define a common api over

1751
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,559
them and build protocol around that api

1752
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:23,920
and this provides a way you know that we

1753
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,920
can build a protocol without having to

1754
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,880
care about the details of the

1755
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,359
cryptography and provides a target that

1756
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:31,280
cryptographers can look at and design

1757
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,040
new schemes and if they plug into this

1758
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,040
api then they can presumably be used

1759
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,760
inside of ppm with uh

1760
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,920
more quickly and more easily than if

1761
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,880
they'd been

1762
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,040
designed kind of completely from scratch

1763
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,400
using a new

1764
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,040
not not reusing that construct so what

1765
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,400
i'm going to talk about here is mostly

1766
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,880
the api and i'll talk a little bit about

1767
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,720
the instantiations um at the end

1768
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,200
um so as ecker outline uh so just

1769
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,400
briefly to define like what we're

1770
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,000
actually doing here

1771
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,119
um so the idea of this vdaf is to kind

1772
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,280
of capture the critical things we need

1773
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,319
the cryptography to do inside of ppm

1774
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:09,680
so kind of working

1775
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,440
back to front the aggregation bit is um

1776
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,440
the idea that's you know the inputs this

1777
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,359
process are individual measurements and

1778
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,280
what comes out of it at the end is an

1779
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,200
aggregate measurement over those

1780
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,200
individual measurements

1781
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,799
distributed in the sense that it's

1782
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,520
distributed among a bunch of aggregators

1783
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,760
um you know that the computation of that

1784
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,200
aggregate is distributed over those

1785
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,359
aggregators and the privacy properties

1786
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:34,720
of the individual measurements are

1787
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,799
assured by non-collusion among those

1788
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:38,240
aggregators

1789
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,480
and finally it's verifiable in the sense

1790
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,799
that the aggregators can check that the

1791
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:44,240
inputs have

1792
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,799
meet some properties um as ecker pointed

1793
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:48,640
out you know there's risk in this sort

1794
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,960
of uh distributed scenario

1795
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,799
that the measurement results that get

1796
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:55,359
reported in by uh the measurement points

1797
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,760
could be corrupt it could be invalid um

1798
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,440
and they that could flow through and

1799
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,680
lead to a garbled aggregate so we will

1800
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,839
have some checks in here um

1801
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:06,799
that um allow the aggregators to verify

1802
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,079
that the measurements they're getting

1803
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,079
are meet some definition of correctness

1804
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,839
now which exactly which definitions you

1805
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:13,200
can apply varies a little bit by the

1806
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,760
instantiation

1807
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,160
so looking at how this kind of plays out

1808
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,079
you know this is the kind of classic

1809
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:21,680
measurement scenario this is how a lot

1810
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,599
of telemetry works today where

1811
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,599
you have a client out there

1812
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,359
you know actually many clients but i'm

1813
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,200
only going to portray one on this slide

1814
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,720
you have many clients out there

1815
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,880
collecting uh measurements of something

1816
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,480
you know where people clicked in an

1817
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,400
application or what what not and

1818
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,319
reporting that back to a collector

1819
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:41,359
and the as you know you've seen various

1820
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,839
takes on this on the last few

1821
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:45,200
but the idea here is that we're

1822
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,440
introducing this aggregator tier in

1823
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,480
between the client and the collector and

1824
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,599
the idea of these

1825
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,920
aggregators is that the client shards

1826
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,040
their each measurement out

1827
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,559
to

1828
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,000
individual shards of the aggregators

1829
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,680
such that you can only make sense of

1830
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,960
that measurement if you have all the

1831
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,920
shares that's how we get that

1832
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,240
non-collusion guarantee

1833
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,680
the aggregators then go through this

1834
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,520
process of what i've called prepare the

1835
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,119
term using the draft is preparing the

1836
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:13,680
measurements so that's that includes um

1837
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,599
verifying that the uh

1838
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,960
measurements are correct are um

1839
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,119
acceptable that they're correct

1840
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:23,680
um and you know transforming them into

1841
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,640
an aggregateable encoding perhaps that's

1842
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,640
necessary in some realizations

1843
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,319
um so once you've kind of taken the

1844
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,000
individual measurements and prepared

1845
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,359
them um you aggregate them

1846
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,960
this is kind of where you do that stuff

1847
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,839
that echoes over you i add up the shares

1848
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:42,000
into a share of the sum

1849
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,760
and then finally the aggregators send

1850
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,520
their uh aggregate shares over to the

1851
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,520
collector who unshards them to get the

1852
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,520
final results so this is kind of the

1853
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,400
data flow view of the same thing um i

1854
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,839
think the interesting thing here from

1855
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,440
the kind of protocol point of view is

1856
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,960
you notice there's a kind of back and

1857
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,280
forth thing at the preparation stage

1858
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,680
there is a need for some some chattiness

1859
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,119
um some interaction between the

1860
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,760
aggregators in that verification process

1861
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,760
to enable um

1862
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,520
a distributed verification of the

1863
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,000
correctness of the input shares

1864
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,079
um but otherwise hopefully this kind of

1865
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:17,200
explains the overall process um also

1866
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,000
this

1867
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,400
the kind of little gray squares that uh

1868
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,920
parallel to the output shares are other

1869
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,839
and then to indicate other output shares

1870
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:25,920
the idea that an aggregate share

1871
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,319
represents the aggregation

1872
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:31,280
of the output shares over a batch of

1873
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,520
measurements and as was pointed out

1874
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,039
before it's up to the aggregators to do

1875
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:36,720
things like enforce minimum batch sizes

1876
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,520
define what a batch is

1877
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,000
so that's kind of the data flow

1878
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,599
um

1879
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,599
this is how kind of how we've described

1880
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,839
that api in the draft

1881
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:51,280
again just kind of using notations here

1882
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,839
so basically you know what the

1883
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:57,680
vdaf draft defines is this api and how a

1884
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,680
couple of instantiations fulfill that

1885
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,720
api

1886
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,880
and then ppm's job is to do the plumbing

1887
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,440
to get the inputs and outputs of of

1888
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,680
these uh local

1889
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,760
functions to the right places at the

1890
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,000
right time so that at the end of the day

1891
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,920
you can unshard into a measurement

1892
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:17,799
that's meaningful to the collector

1893
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,480
in the draft we define a couple of

1894
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,559
constructions i think ecker probably

1895
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:23,760
described

1896
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,039
described these in a little bit more

1897
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,319
detail

1898
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:29,440
prio is is the one where we that i think

1899
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,319
uh enpa is is based on uh the diversion

1900
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:34,880
in the draft is is i think

1901
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,480
has a few more changes on top of what's

1902
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,640
in the npa but that's one where you have

1903
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,480
a fair bit of deployment experience and

1904
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,760
then the hits protocol is the one that

1905
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,839
lets you get distribution on strings

1906
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:45,039
there's been some discussion in chat

1907
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:46,640
about whether you know possibly we could

1908
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,480
fit something like star in here um

1909
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,160
that's i mean it's kind of the idea of

1910
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,720
the draft is that we can look at not

1911
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,880
just these two but also fitting

1912
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,640
other things in under this umbrella so

1913
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,480
that we can have ppm as a generic

1914
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,240
construct into which we can fit multiple

1915
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,839
different cryptographic realizations

1916
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,960
there's a few implementations so far

1917
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,280
this is kind of uh well we have the one

1918
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,319
that supports enpa uh with prio v2 uh

1919
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:16,640
we've got some uh early implementations

1920
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,640
of uh distributed point functions are

1921
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,480
what supports uh kind of the inner loop

1922
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,760
of hits um and there's some work on

1923
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,039
various previous

1924
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:26,480
instantiations

1925
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,400
um i think one of the things interesting

1926
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,599
that comes out of this is that we can

1927
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,839
start to do some measurements of the

1928
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:33,920
cost of doing these algorithms um if you

1929
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,599
look at the papers in which they're

1930
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,520
published there's you know it might look

1931
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,799
intimidating in terms of the amount of

1932
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:39,920
data that's getting sent around the

1933
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,680
amount of computations being done but

1934
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,280
with these implementations we have some

1935
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,480
early data about the expense of

1936
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,920
in terms of computation and

1937
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,760
communications overhead

1938
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,079
of doing these private schemes and you

1939
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:53,760
know

1940
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,680
your mileage may vary but it seems

1941
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,000
seems tolerable to first order let's say

1942
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,680
that

1943
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,480
um

1944
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,000
so yeah i think that's all i had

1945
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,200
yeah a couple references

1946
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,720
much that puts us right on schedule

1947
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,760
again

1948
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,640
uh much appreciated so any any questions

1949
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:19,240
for richard about any of that

1950
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,119
eric

1951
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:30,000
hey

1952
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,960
um so in one of your slides you had the

1953
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,119
aggregators with lines

1954
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,640
between them and in the

1955
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,839
um ppm spec i mostly see sort of the

1956
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:43,920
helpers not connected

1957
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,480
are we thinking about a protocol where

1958
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,319
we might imagine

1959
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,400
enabling a topology that

1960
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,640
could have helpers sort of communicating

1961
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,839
with each other um like some npc

1962
01:05:55,839 --> 01:06:00,079
protocols uh allow for yeah this slide

1963
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:02,799
yeah i i i i admit that i'm not an

1964
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:04,720
expert on kind of what the ppm protocol

1965
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,160
is doing right now i've mainly been

1966
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,839
stuck down at this layer but i think my

1967
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:10,960
understanding is that you can emulate if

1968
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,480
this kind of looks like a broadcast

1969
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,119
channel and if you have a leader that

1970
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:17,280
um is connected to multiple helpers you

1971
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,520
could have basically a star topology

1972
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,960
that over which you can emulate a

1973
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,200
broadcast channel so if if a helper

1974
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,039
needs to it

1975
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:27,680
for us for instance in the in the um

1976
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:31,839
in the pro in the api we've sketched out

1977
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:33,760
we structure the preparation process in

1978
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,039
rounds where the input to each round is

1979
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:39,680
uh the output of the previous run from

1980
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,640
all uh aggregators so i think the in the

1981
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,240
ppm

1982
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,079
content kind of communications model you

1983
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,559
can envision all helpers submitting

1984
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,240
their outputs from the previous round

1985
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,160
and then the the leader distributing

1986
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,240
those outputs out to all of the helpers

1987
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,000
for the next round

1988
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,480
kind of yeah

1989
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,480
just to add on to that yeah i think

1990
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,319
basically the assumption is that the

1991
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:03,599
communication is probably mediated by

1992
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:05,440
the leader um but that that's the

1993
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,200
assumption it is embedded in ppm not

1994
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,359
embedded here and certainly that turned

1995
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,119
out to be not a workable function so

1996
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:13,200
figure something out

1997
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,039
yeah i mean i think it might be useful

1998
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:17,680
for the leader to be able to

1999
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,559
you know uh coordinate helpers directly

2000
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:21,839
connecting to each other just to

2001
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:25,359
minimize communication overhead but

2002
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,280
as long as that's sort of within scope

2003
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,720
or or whatnot

2004
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,440
considering i'm fine yeah we have a this

2005
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,359
is this is like a straw man thing um

2006
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,520
it's not a like like for any change

2007
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,520
radically i imagine

2008
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,759
thank you

2009
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,559
chris patton i saw you briefly flash up

2010
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:48,000
in the speaker let's hear the geocomment

2011
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,599
so i don't need to reiterate it

2012
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,520
okay

2013
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,960
seeing no one else in the queue thank

2014
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,039
you again uh very much richard

2015
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:06,400
we're gonna go ahead and move on to um

2016
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,760
well first we're going to call and bring

2017
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,319
the slides up here

2018
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,399
so we're going to move on to a call for

2019
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:22,319
expression of interest from folks in

2020
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:23,520
this

2021
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,880
just just to make sure that there is

2022
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,799
enough critical mass behind this aside

2023
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:28,960
from the people who have presented here

2024
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,000
uh we'd like to ask who in attendance is

2025
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,399
interested in working on this technology

2026
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:36,000
um

2027
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,359
trying to figure out we probably don't

2028
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:39,198
need people to speak to this necessarily

2029
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,120
although we're very happy to hear what

2030
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,279
you have to say on the topic

2031
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:46,080
i'm also going to throw up a

2032
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:50,198
quick show of hands

2033
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,960
there we go

2034
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:10,719
so go ahead tommy

2035
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,198
hello all right

2036
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:16,238
um

2037
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:18,719
i i did the show i just wanted to speak

2038
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,600
up a little bit to mention

2039
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,000
from my perspective you know uh

2040
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,839
we definitely have

2041
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:27,839
or already we're using stuff like this

2042
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:29,040
and seeing something like this be

2043
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,479
standardized

2044
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:32,000
and taken on by the word group would be

2045
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,679
something that would be a positive thing

2046
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:35,120
so

2047
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,238
you know we didn't do any of the

2048
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,000
presentations here but

2049
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,880
we're definitely interested

2050
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,120
thank you

2051
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,120
does anyone else want to stand up and

2052
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:58,239
speak specifically to it

2053
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,440
that we did get um uh is two things one

2054
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,679
that uh uh i think everybody who is beak

2055
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:06,960
is interested in working on this just so

2056
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,840
we're all clear and second um uh uh if

2057
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,280
you look at the um there's a bunch of

2058
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,400
people in the jabra chat that are saying

2059
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,920
they're interested including facebook

2060
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,719
and whatever thursday oh excellent thank

2061
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:17,840
you

2062
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,199
all right uh robin

2063
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,640
is the audio okay

2064
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,080
yes

2065
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,719
great thanks adam um yeah this is uh so

2066
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:30,239
this is a personal comment rather than

2067
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:32,400
anything on icelock's behalf

2068
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,400
uh i would be interested in

2069
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,880
at least following the work and

2070
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,199
um i would also have a personal interest

2071
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:40,320
in

2072
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,239
seeing to what extent it can be used to

2073
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:45,199
test the the um

2074
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,440
growing and increasingly mature body of

2075
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,480
work on

2076
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,280
um

2077
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,560
what's sometimes called valley

2078
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,400
value-based design

2079
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,120
so in in other words um what systematic

2080
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:58,719
approach can you um adopt for

2081
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:01,520
the design and innovation process

2082
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,239
that ensures that ethical factors and

2083
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:07,040
values are considered at each relevant

2084
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,560
step

2085
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,120
and i think that would

2086
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,040
that would help clarify a lot of the

2087
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,520
comments in the chat

2088
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,560
about

2089
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,800
along the lines of yes but this happens

2090
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,239
already or

2091
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:22,560
um well this only works if you can

2092
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,080
assume there's no collusion and so on

2093
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,239
because what it does is it flushes those

2094
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,480
assumptions out

2095
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,239
and lets you determine whether you want

2096
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:35,280
to design in a way that is compatible

2097
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,520
with those behaviors or actually perhaps

2098
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,280
even conceivably

2099
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,480
inhibits those behaviors

2100
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,880
okay thanks

2101
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,520
uh yari

2102
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,000
yeah i just want to briefly mention that

2103
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,679
i do think this is

2104
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:01,520
exciting technology and we should work

2105
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,560
on that

2106
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,159
i can see

2107
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:05,920
other types of applications we mostly

2108
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,840
talked about

2109
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,320
sort of application type browser type of

2110
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:13,920
things but also many types of networks

2111
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,320
could probably use this this technology

2112
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,360
to

2113
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,600
do a better job at

2114
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,440
collecting information that needs to be

2115
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,600
collected for various uh

2116
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,600
debugging and uh other other reasons

2117
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,199
the only piece that i was sort of a

2118
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,600
little bit concerned about was was this

2119
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,080
advertising piece and i sort of just uh

2120
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,520
as a personal opinion i had some

2121
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,440
reservations about

2122
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,920
browsers working with advertisers

2123
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,600
even though i do recognize that i need

2124
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,440
to do something better than we do today

2125
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,800
but uh

2126
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,719
you know maybe there's also other paths

2127
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:48,560
for the advertisement problems trying

2128
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,480
trying to prevent information flow

2129
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,760
rather than

2130
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,159
collaboration but uh i don't work for

2131
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:56,320
the advertisement in the industry so

2132
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,080
anyway i i like this this should go

2133
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,159
ahead

2134
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,760
thank you

2135
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,760
wendy

2136
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:18,120
so i we can't hear you unfortunately

2137
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,960
there may be

2138
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,960
an incorrect input device selected or

2139
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,600
something along those lines

2140
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:41,520
okay um i think we probably need to let

2141
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,480
you try to work that out and um get back

2142
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,640
in the queue

2143
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,719
thanks

2144
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:51,280
uh ted

2145
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,760
uh thanks uh i basically caught in the

2146
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,239
queue to to answer one of the bob

2147
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:02,400
questions that's do i think the problem

2148
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,080
statement is clear well scope solvable

2149
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,320
and useful to solve and i think one of

2150
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,480
the things that kind of worries me about

2151
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,280
the way it was presented today is that

2152
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,600
it's talking about what seems to me to

2153
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,760
be a set of problems

2154
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,159
and aggregating them into something

2155
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:20,880
which seems to be arguing that a single

2156
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,679
solution is the best solution

2157
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:26,159
for each of the ones in this set

2158
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:27,840
and i would be very interested in seeing

2159
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,920
the work go forward but i would suggest

2160
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,840
that in scoping the work that you do it

2161
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,920
in a way that allows you to say

2162
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,640
the best answer for this

2163
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,040
member of that set may be different from

2164
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,040
the best answer for that member of the

2165
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,400
set in particular the the set of

2166
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,159
problems you're dealing with with

2167
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:50,400
something like identifying bad urls etc

2168
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,800
doesn't really involve tying two actions

2169
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,400
together in the same way that an ad

2170
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,640
conversion does so it may be that there

2171
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,080
are simpler

2172
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,400
mechanisms or only a partial use of this

2173
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,520
system that would still satisfy those

2174
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,480
where invoking the full thing might be

2175
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,040
more difficult and not necessarily

2176
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,800
buying you everything

2177
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,800
that it would need to buy you when when

2178
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,640
you had the conversion case

2179
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,280
so i think as a set of problems it's

2180
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,280
interesting to work on but i would

2181
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,840
prefer that we take it as a set

2182
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,840
uh when we take the work in

2183
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,280
thank you ted

2184
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,480
uh

2185
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,719
phillip

2186
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:31,760
yeah i

2187
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,199
i like this

2188
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:34,159
stuff

2189
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:36,400
uh i don't think that we understand the

2190
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,440
problem but i want to do it anyway

2191
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,280
um

2192
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,880
i am a bit worried that we seem to have

2193
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,440
gone straight for the

2194
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,880
real high falutin cryptography

2195
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,880
rather than measures like

2196
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,840
let's just encrypt log files

2197
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,920
as they're produced

2198
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,520
rather than having them sit in plain

2199
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,440
text ready to be stolen

2200
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,040
so there's a bunch of real bread and

2201
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,920
butter issues i think that we need to do

2202
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:04,840
as

2203
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,679
itf before we do the stuff that really

2204
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:09,120
excites us

2205
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,159
the other thing that i point to is this

2206
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,960
has been presented in terms of a network

2207
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:16,960
realization

2208
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,840
i think that the more immediate and more

2209
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,640
useful use for this would be to assist

2210
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,800
work like the stuff that my wife does

2211
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,159
analyzing

2212
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:28,880
workers compensation claims

2213
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,520
in that there you've got enormous amount

2214
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,719
of

2215
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:35,440
really privacy sensitive data

2216
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,920
that is aggregated together

2217
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,040
and then she analyzes it

2218
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:44,400
and so it that's not a network uh

2219
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,760
application

2220
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,960
but that transition from i have this

2221
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,280
large amount of data

2222
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,679
i would like to pre-process it into a

2223
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:56,480
form that it can't then leak

2224
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,800
in a dangerous way and analyze it in

2225
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,000
that form

2226
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,960
i think that that technology

2227
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,600
would be very useful

2228
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,040
disconnected from the whole network case

2229
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,199
and it might make for

2230
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:13,199
some uh

2231
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:15,840
starting problems that are rather

2232
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,719
simpler than trying to think about how

2233
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,000
do we secure the web

2234
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,040
thank you

2235
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:30,519
um chris

2236
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:41,239
so there we go

2237
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,600
so uh

2238
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,360
chris oh chris appears to have

2239
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,920
disappeared he's showing us offline uh

2240
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,560
let's move on to west

2241
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:04,400
thanks so

2242
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,280
uh you know in general i think this is a

2243
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,800
an interesting problem to look at and

2244
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,800
it's certainly something that we could

2245
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,600
consider doing it's uh as ted said it

2246
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,920
meets all of the buff criteria

2247
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,840
except for we don't want oddity right

2248
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,080
that that this solution is really

2249
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,440
designed to help us protect ourselves or

2250
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,679
protect end users

2251
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:28,960
from good people right because it it has

2252
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,440
no ability to prevent all of the evil

2253
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,760
sites and the the evil of you know

2254
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,239
mechanisms and evil ad trackers that

2255
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:38,800
don't want to use aggregation because

2256
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,800
they're deliberately trying to track

2257
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,400
individual people

2258
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,960
and you know i i think it would be sort

2259
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,960
of fair to say that this cool new

2260
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,719
technology really helps you perfect

2261
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:50,480
protect you from companies that may

2262
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,080
already be behaving reasonably in the

2263
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,360
first place

2264
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,280
and that doesn't mean that it's not

2265
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,280
worth doing but you know there's a

2266
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,040
security consideration sections i'd be

2267
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:02,239
considering writing

2268
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,320
looks like chris is connected against

2269
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:12,880
let's go ahead and take him next thanks

2270
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,719
yeah sorry about that um

2271
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:16,560
i i just wanted to echo something that

2272
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,800
richard was saying in the chat um

2273
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,600
uh and and perhaps uh ask us to take a

2274
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,679
step back from the advertising use cases

2275
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:24,719
um

2276
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:27,040
and recognize that uh this this pattern

2277
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,400
that we're seeing across the industry

2278
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,480
across different problems domains uh for

2279
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,640
collecting these aggregates be it in

2280
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,800
you know telemetry for browsers or

2281
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,760
exposure notification for covid or even

2282
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,280
you know bandwidth measurements in the

2283
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,560
case of tor

2284
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,040
is very very common um

2285
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,679
and i think it's certainly true that we

2286
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:47,320
have uh confidence in

2287
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,040
[Music]

2288
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,719
the general shape of the problem that is

2289
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:53,360
to say we we want to we have we need to

2290
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,360
collect these aggregate statistics to

2291
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,920
answer certain questions um

2292
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:58,640
and

2293
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,040
it's uh

2294
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,560
whether or not you know this is harmful

2295
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,400
helpful for the purposes of web

2296
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,600
advertisements and conversion

2297
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,159
measurements in a privacy processing way

2298
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:10,560
i think is a good question to ask

2299
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,400
but that does not i don't think that

2300
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,840
takes away from

2301
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,679
the the very valid use cases that were

2302
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:18,480
also presented here

2303
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,440
that

2304
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,159
could certainly be improved by a more

2305
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:24,480
privacy preserving protocol so

2306
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,880
um i i'm

2307
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,040
very strongly supportive of this work

2308
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,960
it cuts across so many different problem

2309
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,679
domains and use cases and

2310
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:35,920
it's kind of inevitable

2311
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,520
that you know it'd be standardized

2312
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:40,719
somewhere given how important it is so

2313
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:42,639
that's what i want to say thank you

2314
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:43,760
thanks

2315
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,440
um so we've closed the queue in the

2316
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,560
interest of making certain we have

2317
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,000
enough time to discuss the proposed

2318
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,480
charter uh although uh

2319
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:53,760
let's go ahead and move on decker here

2320
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,920
yeah so i would make a number of points

2321
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,639
um so so first i think um you know uh

2322
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:00,320
ted's point um yeah i mean this is a

2323
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,320
toolbox um that's got that that has a

2324
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,480
variety of tools and i think that that

2325
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,920
you know that the one we think about

2326
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,440
this is that the ppm protocol is the

2327
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,280
toolbox and the feed apps the tools um

2328
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:10,639
and so the idea is not it's not it

2329
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:12,719
doesn't define any particular um you

2330
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:15,679
know measurement measurement um you know

2331
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:18,000
thing is to define is to define a set of

2332
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,120
mechanisms which can be used for taking

2333
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,480
different kinds of measurement and then

2334
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:21,760
you know individual applications they

2335
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,600
layer on top of those tools um so that

2336
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,840
would be true both in terms of the you

2337
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,840
know which b dash exists and it'll also

2338
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,719
be true in terms of like how um how you

2339
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,080
build applications on top of the top of

2340
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,520
the vdf because like you know like i

2341
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,719
mean one thing about this is like you've

2342
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:36,159
got a thing that basically doesn't i can

2343
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:38,639
collect counts right and but like what

2344
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:39,760
do you do with those counts is an

2345
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,199
important question um and one that we

2346
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:43,920
don't pretended to define um

2347
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,360
the um

2348
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,159
you know

2349
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:47,920
it's uh um

2350
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,320
uh i i do see some over indexing on the

2351
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,159
on the i'd use case here as well um you

2352
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:54,639
know uh um you know there are a lot of

2353
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:56,800
use cases they're not ads um and in

2354
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,159
particular like there's nothing ad

2355
01:21:58,159 --> 01:22:00,239
specific to any of this um all the ad

2356
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:01,440
specific work

2357
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,360
which exists or somewhere else in in

2358
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,679
past cg um so i mean this is about

2359
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:06,560
building a set of fulfillment

2360
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,480
measurements um and as a really one

2361
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,159
application measurement with that said i

2362
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,000
do think that um you know this question

2363
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,239
about like you know um about this is for

2364
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:15,840
letting good people do do good things i

2365
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:16,880
think though there's two points about

2366
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,560
that one is that there are a lot of

2367
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:21,040
applications where i as wes says good

2368
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,960
people want to take measurements and

2369
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,719
want to be able to like bind themselves

2370
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:26,560
so they can't cheat you um as it can't

2371
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:27,520
be collected the day they don't want to

2372
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,600
have so that's application case one i

2373
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:32,239
think application case two is um that

2374
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,000
there's been a lot of like attempts to

2375
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,400
look at what it would take to like you

2376
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,000
know reproduce partially out ecosystem

2377
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,600
with better privacy because like i think

2378
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:40,800
we'll agree as they're not going to go

2379
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,280
anytime soon and one of the pushbacks

2380
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,360
that one gets when one says doing that

2381
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,280
is it will have a negative impact on the

2382
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,400
ecosystem

2383
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:51,040
as a whole and like you know i'm not um

2384
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,600
you know um i think you know firefox is

2385
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,719
already quite a bunch of anti-tracking

2386
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:56,159
technologies so like i'm not like all in

2387
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:57,040
on that but i think there's a real

2388
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,719
concern people have and so the idea is

2389
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:01,120
not that when we simply offer you know

2390
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,960
these alternative technologies and then

2391
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,719
people use them and they're part of

2392
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:06,159
cookies the idea is that the idea is

2393
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:07,440
that you'll be offered alternative and

2394
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:08,639
that one would

2395
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:10,000
eventually have to deprecate the

2396
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,159
existing privacy-based technologies

2397
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,360
right

2398
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,280
thanks ecker um

2399
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,280
charlie

2400
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,960
yeah i also wanted to uh respond to wes

2401
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,400
and some of the comments in the chat

2402
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,400
just mostly the plus one what ecker said

2403
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,760
but yeah i'm

2404
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,600
uh on the on the google end we're

2405
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,440
definitely looking at

2406
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,280
uh

2407
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,239
like helping helping this this

2408
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:38,880
uh tracking problem on the web with kind

2409
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,480
of a two-pronged approach like one is

2410
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,320
having a well-lit path where we can

2411
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,400
recover use cases in a way that we know

2412
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,440
is is privacy preserving uh something

2413
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,159
like ppm could fit into this story

2414
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:55,920
and once we have kind of a uh

2415
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,560
a a foundation where some of the use

2416
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,719
cases that we think are are important to

2417
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:03,360
maintain the ecosystem are there

2418
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:07,280
then we can go ahead and uh remove kind

2419
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,800
of the bad stuff

2420
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,199
that we think is bad for user privacy so

2421
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:12,960
this question of like oh only the good

2422
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,320
guys will do it and the bad guys will

2423
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,239
use this other stuff like here i think

2424
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:19,040
the platform can really mediate this and

2425
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,960
if we think that the platform provides a

2426
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,520
good enough foundation then we can we

2427
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,239
can remove the stuff that we think is is

2428
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:28,159
bad for user privacy and this is like

2429
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:30,800
our our strategy that we're trying to do

2430
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,320
uh on chrome

2431
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,080
where you know we're investing all this

2432
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,920
time trying to come up with new browser

2433
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,600
primitives um and also we have like a

2434
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,520
timeline where we want to

2435
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,159
uh disable third-party cookies um and

2436
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:47,760
deprecate them uh so yeah we're we're

2437
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,520
i i think i think this is like a

2438
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,840
reasonable point but it's you know it's

2439
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,760
something that we're we're we're looking

2440
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:57,360
into as like a long-term strategy

2441
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,920
thank you very much charlie um i do want

2442
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,239
to give wendy an opportunity to to come

2443
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:04,239
back in if we think we've uh solved the

2444
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:07,519
audio issues um

2445
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:13,638
all right

2446
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,639
okay um so let's go ahead and move on to

2447
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:27,120
the charter then

2448
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,880
i have it uh

2449
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,400
up here in front of us we've broken into

2450
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,600
two sections

2451
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:32,719
um

2452
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:34,480
it's probably not terribly useful for me

2453
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,080
to try to read through it directly as

2454
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,840
it's on your screens

2455
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,120
but we want to go ahead and take some

2456
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,719
comments here i see our area director

2457
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:41,840
has stepped up

2458
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,800
sorted out and told us to move on

2459
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,199
i'm i'm sorry we missed the first part

2460
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:48,880
of what you said there roman

2461
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:49,679
ah

2462
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:51,920
wendy said that she is not going to be

2463
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,760
able to get her audio working and told

2464
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,760
us to move on but she appreciates the

2465
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,520
opportunity for the slot

2466
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,120
right thank you

2467
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,400
um

2468
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,120
so this is the current proposed charter

2469
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:06,400
or at least the first half of it

2470
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,000
i want to go ahead and open the floor to

2471
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,320
comments on the formulation that we have

2472
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:13,320
here

2473
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,440
and recognizing that people are still

2474
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,800
reading i'm going to give it a bit of

2475
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,800
time

2476
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,560
okay i'm going to go ahead and skip on

2477
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:17,760
to the second half of the charter

2478
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:21,120
which is where a lot of the media's

2479
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,239
specifically the second paragraph talks

2480
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:25,440
about exactly what the working group

2481
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,678
will be doing

2482
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,280
florence

2483
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,920
um thank you um so thanks for all the

2484
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:40,880
presentations it's been really

2485
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:43,440
interesting um so most presentations

2486
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,600
today were about use cases

2487
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,080
um but there's nothing about that in the

2488
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,480
charter i don't think although i can

2489
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,000
only see the second side now

2490
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,760
um or i don't think currently in the

2491
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,840
draft um

2492
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,080
i think that would be a useful thing to

2493
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:01,679
kind of document somewhere um

2494
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:05,440
all right thanks ecker

2495
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,360
i think we're up for that i guess um you

2496
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,800
know i think the the one thing we're

2497
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:09,840
trying to do with the use case is

2498
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,520
motivational um because i think like the

2499
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,960
these are generic techniques but i think

2500
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,400
be for i think i'd be more than happy to

2501
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,159
think to like write down like what like

2502
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:17,120
i'm not going to visualize you

2503
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,159
understand why you want to collect

2504
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:20,159
making a statistic and just to say

2505
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:21,760
something um siobhan should ask in the

2506
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,520
chat is there's room for like for like

2507
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,560
multiple

2508
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,159
um for like for like multiple

2509
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:27,920
instantiations of the same basic task i

2510
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,120
think absolutely something for instance

2511
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,480
if there's a there's a better mechanism

2512
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,239
for for collecting heavy hitters than

2513
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:33,760
than hits which is relatively expensive

2514
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,280
that would like something like that i

2515
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,760
think room for um i think you know um

2516
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,600
you know uh uh

2517
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,600
like i'd certainly be interested like

2518
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,280
like i think i want to build something

2519
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:44,639
where like as new photography gets

2520
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:45,840
adults we can add it and i'm going to

2521
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,000
build something where we have multiple

2522
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,360
mechanisms that like support the same

2523
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:51,600
basic thing um i think you know the only

2524
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,440
the only question i i i want to make

2525
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,320
sure it's like you know if we have

2526
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,600
something radically different it's all

2527
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,880
like some light weight it doesn't match

2528
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:57,920
up then we have to ask would be better

2529
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,760
to make a new a new protocol or better

2530
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,520
to fit it in but like i'm i'm like

2531
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:05,199
definitely pro fitting they do things

2532
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,719
thanks siobhan

2533
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:13,199
okay yeah i just wanted to see that um

2534
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:15,600
that's that's encouraging i just want to

2535
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,199
make sure that like the currently the

2536
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:19,199
charter i think would kind of rule out

2537
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:20,639
some of the ideas

2538
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:22,639
um alternatives to achieve the same

2539
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:24,719
goals so i think the charter would need

2540
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:27,760
some tweaking

2541
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:34,480
just specifically which aspect of it

2542
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,360
um i think if you go to the previous one

2543
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,679
previous slide sorry

2544
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:43,440
um i think

2545
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,360
like splitting measurements between

2546
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,880
multiple non-including servers like i

2547
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:47,679
think

2548
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:48,800
um

2549
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,199
that is like a class of

2550
01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:54,000
for techniques for

2551
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,760
achieving the scope of privacy

2552
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,280
preserving measurements but i think you

2553
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:00,639
could do it in other ways as well

2554
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:02,560
and i see there's some support to

2555
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,840
rewrite text

2556
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,400
and i'm happy to send a pr

2557
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,400
thank you for the clarification

2558
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,679
okay um jim

2559
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,080
i think the charter needs to say

2560
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,639
something about use cases and threat

2561
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:20,719
models i don't have any formal words for

2562
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:22,400
that at this point

2563
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:23,840
but i do think that's the important

2564
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,239
thing to capture here because

2565
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:28,080
if we're going to be developing multiple

2566
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:29,760
solutions as ted was alluding to

2567
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,199
everyone there might be different threat

2568
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:32,719
models that apply to them rather than

2569
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,719
the single overarching one and i think

2570
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:35,760
it would be good to make sure that

2571
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,440
information is clearly captured when

2572
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,440
things have developed and obviously that

2573
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:42,719
needs to fit into the charter cheers

2574
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:44,080
thank you

2575
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:47,080
eric

2576
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:51,040
on a similar line actually uh

2577
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:51,920
there was

2578
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,120
uh

2579
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,520
comments in the chat earlier about sort

2580
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,880
of different scene attacks and simple

2581
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,600
attacks and comments that differential

2582
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,520
privacy would be required and that the

2583
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,040
um

2584
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,280
the vdfs have um

2585
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:08,800
you know sort of had the scope for that

2586
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,000
is it

2587
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,560
meaningful to like say that these will

2588
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,560
support privacy

2589
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,120
respecting incorporation values

2590
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:20,320
um without having some definition of

2591
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:21,760
what we mean by

2592
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,440
a a

2593
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,040
private value

2594
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:27,760
or should that be here or should that be

2595
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:31,840
at the at the vdf level

2596
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:38,719
all right thanks

2597
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:41,760
charlie

2598
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,719
yeah i just wanted to uh

2599
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:47,040
i guess drill in a little deeper in the

2600
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,280
charter of like what aggregation

2601
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:51,520
actually means and it might be good to

2602
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:52,400
have

2603
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,159
maybe like a uh

2604
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:57,520
a definition there i see like with the

2605
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:58,719
server can't learn the value of

2606
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:00,880
individual measurements which maybe that

2607
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:03,440
suffices to say as long as that's the

2608
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,199
case you can't uh

2609
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:07,040
you can't have aggregate measurements

2610
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,639
but some of the use cases that we're

2611
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:10,960
considering like you know are not are

2612
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,520
don't very neatly fall into this realm

2613
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:14,880
of like you're learning in aggregate

2614
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:15,679
like

2615
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:16,480
you know

2616
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,880
you're if you learn like a private ml

2617
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,040
model that you can verify is you know

2618
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,480
differentially private or something like

2619
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,840
that would we consider that an aggregate

2620
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:28,800
like maybe maybe not um but it would be

2621
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,440
it would be great if there's you know

2622
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,600
at least from our perspective i think it

2623
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,679
would be great if things like uh ml

2624
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:38,080
models fit within this scope of the

2625
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,639
charter

2626
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:42,800
all right thanks

2627
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,280
andrew

2628
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:49,600
uh yeah just uh adding to the the early

2629
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,360
point uh i completely agree with the

2630
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:54,560
idea of adding in the use cases but just

2631
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,880
as echo appointments come up in the chat

2632
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,000
um

2633
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,639
i think also consider adding uh abuse

2634
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:04,719
cases and ideally mitigations uh as well

2635
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:05,520
um

2636
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,040
which might help alleviate some of the

2637
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,520
concerns about some of the dark

2638
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:13,520
practices in this general area thanks

2639
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:14,960
thank you

2640
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,360
watson

2641
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,800
watson i'm relaying a message from wendy

2642
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:23,920
in the chat

2643
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:26,080
uh she said she wrote i'm just gonna

2644
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,400
first voice support from w3c for this

2645
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,560
work as there's working incubation that

2646
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,800
could use it

2647
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,880
ah thank you

2648
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,719
steven

2649
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:38,080
yeah just under the abuse cases use

2650
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,920
cases thing i think

2651
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:42,000
given that this i think is probably

2652
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,120
pretty

2653
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:46,080
good technology that could be used well

2654
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,679
i'm not too worried about documenting

2655
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:49,040
use cases and that could be a bit of a

2656
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,120
time sink but given that this good

2657
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:52,800
technology could be abused i think

2658
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,880
effort spent in that direction would be

2659
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,480
much more valuable

2660
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,159
uh particularly if we find ways of

2661
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:01,440
mitigating abuses that we see

2662
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,560
okay thanks

2663
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,800
nick

2664
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:16,719
nick30cdt and

2665
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:18,800
thanks for presenting all this everyone

2666
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:21,360
on the charter i had uh

2667
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:25,120
two questions or concerns for now um

2668
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,679
one i think we're talking about uh abuse

2669
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:29,040
and and things like that but i also

2670
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:30,719
think there's a lot of the privacy that

2671
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:33,360
depends on

2672
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:34,960
assumptions about

2673
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:39,199
non-collusion or about how the

2674
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:42,159
client is going to find the different

2675
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:44,480
servers or or configure them and i'm a

2676
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,440
little bit worried that that's all

2677
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,600
getting marked out of scope

2678
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,840
in in the hope that like

2679
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,760
uh maybe we can just ignore that problem

2680
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,880
or someone else will fix it i i'm i

2681
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,960
guess i think we should be discussing it

2682
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,480
if we're going to put a lot of effort

2683
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,880
into

2684
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,159
into the work of the protocol that

2685
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:04,639
depends on those things um

2686
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:06,719
the other concern is about the name i

2687
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:08,239
think maybe it's come up a little bit

2688
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:12,080
already in the chat um i i think priv is

2689
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:14,880
is both very confusing does not describe

2690
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,360
the work that's happening about uh

2691
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,840
privacy preserving measurement um and

2692
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,600
actively misleading that this is the

2693
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,679
group doing everything about privacy or

2694
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:25,360
incorporation of values sounds like a

2695
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:26,639
very general

2696
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:28,080
concept that i would support but that

2697
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,159
this charter is not related to so i

2698
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:31,280
think it's

2699
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:35,119
actively misleading we should change it

2700
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:37,040
all right thank you

2701
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,400
so

2702
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,560
nick i'm going to ask that you send

2703
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,800
some concrete suggestions for your first

2704
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,320
bullet point to the list if you have

2705
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,639
some some time to do so

2706
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:48,239
thanks

2707
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:49,679
sure

2708
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:52,239
uh chris

2709
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,560
let's plus one to that like i i think it

2710
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:01,440
it priv does seem overly blo broad um

2711
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,280
but also i wanted to address okay i want

2712
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,119
to talk about the abuse

2713
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:06,560
use cases people are talking about in

2714
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,480
chat so

2715
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,480
uh one of the things that was brought up

2716
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,480
is like what about clients like trying

2717
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,560
to like corrupt the computation by

2718
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,239
sending focus inputs or something like

2719
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:18,400
that so that form of abuse is something

2720
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,800
that we're explicitly trying to rule out

2721
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:25,280
so um in the in the so like a vdf is is

2722
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,639
verifiable in the sense that um invalid

2723
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:32,080
inputs can be detected and removed from

2724
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:37,000
the um output of of the computation

2725
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:39,840
all right thanks so just for

2726
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,760
clarification uh and i this is addressed

2727
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,199
that stephen um when we're talking about

2728
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:44,800
abuse cases is that the kind of abuse

2729
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,000
you're talking about are you talking

2730
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,679
about like abuse of the actual data

2731
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:50,320
being collected

2732
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:51,440
so

2733
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,679
again pardon my ignorance it's vast but

2734
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:56,080
uh so for example if this tech this this

2735
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,400
technology could be used to measure

2736
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,400
things into small in aggregates that are

2737
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:04,560
too small and that become exposing or if

2738
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,320
if some application had some kind of

2739
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,840
opt-in mechanism and then it was

2740
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,320
possible to change what gets measured in

2741
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,400
ways that are damaging for users those i

2742
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,400
think would be kind of abuses that are a

2743
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,440
bit

2744
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,119
you know a bit less concrete than the

2745
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:19,600
example given um

2746
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:20,800
you know

2747
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:21,679
all right

2748
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:23,119
it's i was just i was hearing what i

2749
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:24,480
thought were two senses of abuse and

2750
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,560
that appears to be the case so thank you

2751
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:27,840
claire but

2752
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,520
yeah yeah but i'm not i'm explicitly not

2753
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:30,880
asking that we try and fix everything

2754
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,320
because it might might not all be fixed

2755
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:33,920
and fixable but if we can think about it

2756
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,000
in detail and propose what mitigations

2757
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,920
are possible then i think that that

2758
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:40,639
would be good

2759
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:44,719
thank you very much uh yuri

2760
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:47,520
thank you um so plus one on the name

2761
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:50,400
confusion issue uh plus one on talking

2762
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:53,040
about abuse cases and i i think that's

2763
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,119
mostly by the you know whoever is doing

2764
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,040
the measurements not not so much about

2765
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:58,000
the

2766
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,280
abuse by by the user users should still

2767
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:02,400
be able to

2768
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:04,480
produce the data that they want to

2769
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:06,719
produce as long as it's sort of within

2770
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:08,080
bounds

2771
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:11,040
um the other thing is that i i think

2772
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,719
maybe there's some room for

2773
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:15,760
a discussion of opt-in opt-out type of

2774
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,600
solutions and if we

2775
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,440
learn from some other

2776
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,760
protocol cases like first in quick

2777
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,360
there's the spin bit

2778
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,360
where there's an arrangement that some

2779
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,040
fraction of the users are automatically

2780
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,960
always excluded from

2781
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:31,119
from spinning um in order to create this

2782
01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:32,719
set of users that don't

2783
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:34,639
do a particular action and

2784
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:36,080
similar techniques might actually apply

2785
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,639
here that you automatically exclude some

2786
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:40,400
set of users

2787
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,320
um and then you sort of create this

2788
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:43,679
opportunity to

2789
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:46,239
not do this and users can opt out

2790
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:49,280
without being targeted as of doubters

2791
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:50,800
and so i think that that kind of thing

2792
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:53,119
would be important um i don't have the

2793
01:38:53,119 --> 01:38:55,440
specific language for the charter or

2794
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,520
maybe something about um

2795
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,080
you know enabling opt-in and opt-out or

2796
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:02,639
realistic opt-in and opt-out

2797
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:05,119
possibilities thank you

2798
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:06,639
thanks

2799
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:09,040
hecker

2800
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,239
generally uh just the opt-in thing of

2801
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:13,520
generally these are these are

2802
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:15,360
configuration points of some kind and

2803
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,119
and clients um

2804
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:18,639
um you know uh

2805
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:19,520
um

2806
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,440
but you know the question of exactly how

2807
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:22,960
how users decide whether that got

2808
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:24,560
actually engaged is like is like not

2809
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,080
generally saying we wear a commercial

2810
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,920
itf um

2811
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:30,719
the um uh the poison is making are

2812
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:32,480
absolutely correct um

2813
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,960
like um you know uh there's like a whole

2814
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:36,320
pile of material that has to be done

2815
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:39,199
about uh ensuring that the system the

2816
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:40,800
the system is in does not allow for

2817
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,880
abuse by by the collector or by or by

2818
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,639
the various aggregators um and that's

2819
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:47,119
like a that's like a big topic that um

2820
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:48,159
that like absolutely have to make sure

2821
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:49,760
we hit properly um there's some work

2822
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:50,960
already in the document about it but

2823
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:53,119
like it's it's a grease insufficient so

2824
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:55,679
i think i would um uh uh this is

2825
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:56,960
somebody's just some text but i think

2826
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:58,719
absolutely having um

2827
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:00,639
uh uh um

2828
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:01,760
uh uh

2829
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:03,360
like some tech

2830
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:04,639
like i think having something in texas

2831
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:06,480
have we had to work on you know um

2832
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:07,760
actually like addressing those topics

2833
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:10,400
would be really important

2834
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,280
okay

2835
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:14,080
um

2836
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:16,719
all right martin

2837
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:21,679
just to just a yary's point a lot of the

2838
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:24,239
systems that

2839
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:26,719
are being described here allow people to

2840
01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:28,719
to opt out of the system without

2841
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:31,199
apparently opting out they can generate

2842
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:33,600
the inputs to the system that appear to

2843
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,600
all intents and purposes as valid inputs

2844
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,679
to the system but they're not actually

2845
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:39,920
contributing any any values to the

2846
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:40,880
system

2847
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:42,400
and that's actually a useful property

2848
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:45,440
that is exploited in various ways

2849
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,080
so um i think that that capability

2850
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,440
exists

2851
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,280
i'm not sure that we need to put those

2852
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:53,840
sorts of things into a charter

2853
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:56,239
i do think that we need to include some

2854
01:40:56,239 --> 01:40:57,440
of the

2855
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:59,119
um i think we need to include something

2856
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:01,679
generic about abuse there is something

2857
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:03,920
very specific about abuse in here about

2858
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:06,239
proofs of validity but um

2859
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:08,320
i've spent quite a lot of time thinking

2860
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,320
about things like civil attacks on

2861
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,000
various manifestations of these sorts of

2862
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,600
protocols and and those would be

2863
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,199
interesting things to

2864
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:17,440
to have at least

2865
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:20,719
in the auspices of the group

2866
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:29,760
so slightly different thread that i

2867
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:32,159
meant to ask a while ago

2868
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:34,320
has there been any thought put on what

2869
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,560
type of ecosystem we really want to

2870
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:38,960
develop with this technology

2871
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:40,960
let's consider the fact that collectors

2872
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,199
need to take data from

2873
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:46,560
helpers and leaders essentially and are

2874
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:49,040
we expecting a small number of helpers

2875
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:50,880
and leaders that will be accepted by

2876
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,960
particular collectors or

2877
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:55,760
you know can i and steven stand up our

2878
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:57,760
own helpers and leaders and expect

2879
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:00,159
everything to accept data that we submit

2880
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:01,920
to it because the two of us agree that

2881
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,679
we trust each other but

2882
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:05,440
uh but the collectors you know are the

2883
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,040
collectors only going to accept data

2884
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,440
from certain places and so we end up

2885
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:10,800
with either a very small very

2886
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,280
centralized ecosystem or

2887
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:14,880
or you know a much more flexible

2888
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:17,280
framework

2889
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,920
sierra

2890
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,159
yes so just a quick response to martin

2891
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:28,239
so that's that's really good news um and

2892
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:30,400
i wasn't looking for documenting any of

2893
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,840
that uh

2894
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,920
detail in in the charter perhaps the

2895
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:35,679
high level bit about

2896
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:37,280
being effective

2897
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:39,440
opt-out mechanisms could be in the

2898
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:41,679
charter thank you

2899
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:42,719
thanks

2900
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:45,040
ecker

2901
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:47,440
answer

2902
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:48,719
this question um i think there's a bunch

2903
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:51,360
of like compatible models um i think the

2904
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:52,560
important thing to remember is that the

2905
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,480
person who i'm going back to the right

2906
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,880
model i had i i put up earlier right

2907
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:59,760
that um the the collector has to trust

2908
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:02,480
um the to help the aggregators but the

2909
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,000
clients also trust the aggregators

2910
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:04,880
because the click because aggregators

2911
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,360
responsible for the client's privacy and

2912
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:08,960
so as a practical matter i would expect

2913
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:12,000
i would anticipate that you know um

2914
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,639
that that that you know there'll be a

2915
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:17,520
a a non like you know a non-gigantic

2916
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:19,040
number of collector of different

2917
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:21,040
aggregators because fundamentally you're

2918
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:22,560
you're trusting them to behave correctly

2919
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,159
right so you just you know what you and

2920
01:43:24,159 --> 01:43:25,760
steven probably has worked up except for

2921
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:27,199
like maybe you know maybe i'd be willing

2922
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:30,159
to death um um but um because people

2923
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:31,600
probably rely on relying on the

2924
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:33,520
rotations of the collectors uh oh sorry

2925
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:34,800
the aggregators but i mean this is

2926
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,080
compatible with like an arbitrarily

2927
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:37,920
large number um i would expect to see

2928
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,520
really two models that we talked about

2929
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:42,320
um one of which is um you know people

2930
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,480
who operate just as just designators and

2931
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:45,840
are basically their job is to ensure the

2932
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,199
safety system and then people who

2933
01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:48,400
operate sort of like a more global

2934
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:50,000
system where it's like you know i like

2935
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,600
if you see amplitube it's like you know

2936
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:52,880
look i am like data collection as a

2937
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:56,080
service and like you know i i i i

2938
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:57,280
contract with several several different

2939
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:58,800
variators and that's how i provide the

2940
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,719
system in a box so i put this to those

2941
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:02,960
two models but um there's nothing really

2942
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:04,159
centralized here there's nothing there's

2943
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:05,840
like no there's no reason you know like

2944
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:07,600
every you know

2945
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:08,400
like there are plenty of like

2946
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,400
trustworthy entities in the world and um

2947
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:11,679
and so there's nothing that basically

2948
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:14,159
requires like that like a good the

2949
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:16,400
collector a work with it same set of

2950
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:20,360
aggregators clutter b

2951
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,960
uh chris

2952
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:30,159
bump what eckerd just said but also uh

2953
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:32,239
also kind of point out that something

2954
01:44:32,239 --> 01:44:33,920
that we've been working on in the

2955
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:35,199
protocol

2956
01:44:35,199 --> 01:44:36,159
is

2957
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:38,320
lowering the bar of entry to running

2958
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,880
this this system as much as we can so

2959
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:43,440
there's a sort of asymmetry between

2960
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:46,239
leader and helper so the leader is uh

2961
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:48,960
you know and and this could change um

2962
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:50,800
uh depending on what p what people's

2963
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,480
needs turn out to be

2964
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,639
but what we have been thinking about so

2965
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:57,040
far is the helper should be very very

2966
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:00,000
cheap to run and operate um and a leader

2967
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,600
is inherently more expensive because

2968
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:04,800
it's getting uh measurements directly

2969
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:07,119
from clients it has to store them for

2970
01:45:07,119 --> 01:45:09,280
some amount of time

2971
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:12,960
before they can begin processing them

2972
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,480
how much you have to store and how long

2973
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,320
you have to store it depends on the vda

2974
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:18,159
if you're running

2975
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:19,600
so but

2976
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,280
i think this is one of our goals and i

2977
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:22,230
think this is um

2978
01:45:22,230 --> 01:45:23,360
[Music]

2979
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:25,440
important thing to keep in mind

2980
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,280
regardless of like how the ecosystem

2981
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:29,840
pans out we want it to make we want to

2982
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:31,760
make the bar bar to entry as low as

2983
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,560
possible i think

2984
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,960
all right thank you very much

2985
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:38,239
um

2986
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:39,600
so at this point we'd like to go ahead

2987
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,679
and move on to some questions to inform

2988
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:44,400
the the area directors in the isg about

2989
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,480
community interest for this

2990
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:48,480
i'm going to go ahead and bring up polls

2991
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,159
for each of these

2992
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:52,320
but also at certain points we're going

2993
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:55,119
to ask that if you are not in support of

2994
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:56,320
forming the working group that you go

2995
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:58,880
ahead and put yourself in the queue

2996
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:02,639
so for the first question

2997
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,679
i'm going to ask

2998
01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:09,280
who supports a working group

2999
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,600
with this charter

3000
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,280
and this is modulo any changes that

3001
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:14,960
we've discussed today or come up in the

3002
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:16,159
mailing list

3003
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:19,559
shortly afterwards

3004
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:34,639
and again if you if you don't support

3005
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:37,679
the charter and have not yet spoken we

3006
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:41,840
urge you to join the microphone queue

3007
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,560
okay we seem to have

3008
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:08,400
slowed down so thank you very much for

3009
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,199
the input on that

3010
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:18,239
the next question we're going to ask is

3011
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:20,239
do we think

3012
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:22,480
do you have something to say alyssa

3013
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:24,159
well maybe we should take them one at a

3014
01:47:24,159 --> 01:47:26,560
time so we can hear from

3015
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:27,920
uh

3016
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:30,239
from the folks who did not raise their

3017
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:34,080
hand or explicitly left their hand down

3018
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:35,920
yes i i don't see anyone in the queue

3019
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:38,159
though

3020
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:41,760
okay i just want to make sure it was

3021
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:43,520
clear to people that now is the time to

3022
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,360
to do that if you have something to say

3023
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:46,400
about it

3024
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:47,440
yes

3025
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:50,320
thanks

3026
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:52,560
okay we can move to the next one

3027
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,320
thanks

3028
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,719
so for our second poll um do we think

3029
01:47:56,719 --> 01:47:58,480
the problem statement is clear well

3030
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:03,480
scoped solvable and useful to solve

3031
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:08,159
uh ted go ahead

3032
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:10,080
is this also a module of the discussion

3033
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,360
in the chat because there was a good bit

3034
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:14,400
of it that really did help

3035
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:16,880
uh i would imagine yes i have been

3036
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:19,040
following the chat myself um

3037
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:20,480
but i would hope that any ceiling points

3038
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:21,840
for that would also be brought to the

3039
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,480
mailing list

3040
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:28,000
sorry i'm looking at

3041
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:33,920
the i mean the answer to that is yes i

3042
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,639
mean the work that the charter itself uh

3043
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:38,639
is going to require some edits we've had

3044
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:41,199
some good kind of feedback here so

3045
01:48:41,199 --> 01:48:43,119
consider the chat and the and the

3046
01:48:43,119 --> 01:48:46,119
presentations

3047
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:08,080
so again if you have you have concerns

3048
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:10,400
about the the scoping here

3049
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,560
and are not yet spoken on them

3050
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:14,000
please add yourself to the microphone

3051
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,119
queue

3052
01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:16,639
so we can understand better your

3053
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:19,639
position

3054
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:48,560
nick go ahead please

3055
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:53,040
um

3056
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:55,520
just uh

3057
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,760
okay probably yeah okay doing polls like

3058
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,639
this is is tricky because we're uh

3059
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:03,920
chatting about possible variations i i

3060
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:06,320
agree but um i think we have this like

3061
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:08,719
very open question about our use cases

3062
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:10,639
and abuse case is going to be put into

3063
01:50:10,639 --> 01:50:12,960
the charter or are they going to be a

3064
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:15,679
work item um

3065
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:17,440
and

3066
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:19,440
and until

3067
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:21,440
until some of that is settled until we

3068
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,679
actually are going to define them then i

3069
01:50:23,679 --> 01:50:25,440
think that

3070
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:27,599
it's it's harder to conclude that the

3071
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:30,320
problem statement is is uh completely

3072
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:32,400
clear if we're not actually agreed on

3073
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:36,080
the use and abuses

3074
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:36,840
thank

3075
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:40,560
you okay robin

3076
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,400
and again a personal statement not on

3077
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:49,440
behalf of isoc um

3078
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:51,760
i think the discussion in the chat about

3079
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:54,159
even the name of the group and most of

3080
01:50:54,159 --> 01:50:56,239
the proposed names did not have the word

3081
01:50:56,239 --> 01:50:58,239
value in values

3082
01:50:58,239 --> 01:50:59,040
uh

3083
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:00,239
raises

3084
01:51:00,239 --> 01:51:02,400
questions about the the scope and intent

3085
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,000
of the group that are fundamental enough

3086
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,480
that question two is very difficult to

3087
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:09,360
answer as nick said

3088
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:12,480
ah okay thank you

3089
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:20,320
all right so ecker go ahead

3090
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,000
people seem to be like a little worked

3091
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,199
up about the name i just want to say

3092
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:25,119
like like what happened with the name is

3093
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:26,800
like we were calling this ppm privacy

3094
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,080
reference measurement people was too

3095
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,560
close to ippm i like got

3096
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:32,159
punchy and like trying to figure out how

3097
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:34,560
to say priv so like like really like

3098
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:35,840
there's like like like that's what's

3099
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:37,199
going on here so like if you want to

3100
01:51:37,199 --> 01:51:38,880
like that likes it's just something else

3101
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:40,400
because like like the

3102
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:41,119
the

3103
01:51:41,119 --> 01:51:42,560
like every every letter in there was

3104
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:44,400
like constructed to make it say priv not

3105
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:48,159
for any actual reason other than that

3106
01:51:48,159 --> 01:51:50,559
thank you

3107
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:53,280
okay and then the final two questions

3108
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:55,520
that we're going to have um

3109
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:57,520
typically we would have raised of hands

3110
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:00,159
of this in a physical room um

3111
01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:02,239
because we do like to keep track of who

3112
01:52:02,239 --> 01:52:04,080
exactly answered yes but

3113
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:05,599
to do that effectively here we're going

3114
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:07,599
to ask people in the chat

3115
01:52:07,599 --> 01:52:09,599
if you are willing to review documents

3116
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:10,880
associated with this working group

3117
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:14,920
please respond with review

3118
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:30,719
okay so i've seen uh on the order of 20

3119
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:32,880
people respond so far

3120
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,400
this is a

3121
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,000
very strong signal

3122
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,760
um and secondly uh who here plans to be

3123
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:42,320
an editor for related documents please

3124
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:45,840
respond with edit in the chat

3125
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:02,960
all right

3126
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:05,040
great well thank you very much um that

3127
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:06,400
takes us to the end of the things we

3128
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:08,159
wanted to discuss for this buff i think

3129
01:53:08,159 --> 01:53:10,320
this has been very useful and i want to

3130
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:12,159
give a few moments over to our area

3131
01:53:12,159 --> 01:53:13,199
director

3132
01:53:13,199 --> 01:53:15,678
to speak

3133
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,560
hi everyone i'd like hi everyone i'd

3134
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:22,480
like to repeat uh i think we've had a

3135
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:24,000
successful buff and i want to thank

3136
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,159
everyone for kind of all their input i

3137
01:53:26,159 --> 01:53:28,960
think the chat was just as lively uh as

3138
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:32,000
as the mic line if not more i mean

3139
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
generally what i heard was there is a

3140
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,480
critical mass of interest in working in

3141
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:38,239
this kind of particular problem

3142
01:53:38,239 --> 01:53:40,880
there was repeated the tension i heard

3143
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:43,119
around this idea of you know are we okay

3144
01:53:43,119 --> 01:53:46,159
working on ad tech and the ad use cases

3145
01:53:46,159 --> 01:53:47,679
you know at the same time recognizing

3146
01:53:47,679 --> 01:53:49,920
that that is the reality on the ground

3147
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:52,159
and that there would be wider

3148
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:54,560
applicability of this tech much larger

3149
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:56,320
of these protocols much larger than that

3150
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:58,480
particular kind of use case i think in

3151
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:00,320
the charter discussion we're not ready

3152
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,320
to go with this particular charter there

3153
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:03,760
were a number of

3154
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:05,440
really kind of helpful suggestions about

3155
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:07,119
how to polish that and we'll double

3156
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:08,880
check and kind of confirm that so

3157
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:10,880
specific things i heard reading off my

3158
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:13,280
list is things like let's generalize the

3159
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:14,719
charter text to make sure we're

3160
01:54:14,719 --> 01:54:16,800
sufficiently flexible so we can swap

3161
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:18,560
approaches so it's not just pre-owned

3162
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:20,480
the heavy hitters we need to make sure

3163
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:23,040
that how we define aggregation doesn't

3164
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:25,199
restrict uh you know other kind of

3165
01:54:25,199 --> 01:54:27,920
alternatives we talked about the need

3166
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:30,159
for work items to document the abuse

3167
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:32,080
cases and talk about the threat models

3168
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:34,239
against all the portions of the

3169
01:54:34,239 --> 01:54:36,639
architecture and then we had quite a lot

3170
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:38,239
of conversations that we need to tune

3171
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:39,840
the working group name i don't know what

3172
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:42,239
the solution is uh but that we would

3173
01:54:42,239 --> 01:54:43,760
like a change there

3174
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:46,320
and so i think the proponents seem open

3175
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:48,639
to to making kind of those changes and

3176
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:50,400
that will those changes will be made and

3177
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:51,599
then we'll bring that back for our

3178
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:54,000
confirmation but otherwise i think we do

3179
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,920
have a critical mass and we should we

3180
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:58,080
should kind of polish this uh to con

3181
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:00,480
consensus and so we can move forward

3182
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:03,638
thank you

3183
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:05,520
thank you very much for everyone

3184
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,040

3185
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:09,040
attended buff

3186

oh yes thank you very much peter

3191
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:23,520
us all together and leading us through a

3192
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:26,239
good conversation

3193
01:55:27,119 --> 01:55:28,960
all right thanks all
