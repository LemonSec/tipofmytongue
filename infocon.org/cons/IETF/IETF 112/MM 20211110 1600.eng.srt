1
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,440
so

2
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,399
we'll give another one minute and we get

3
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,399
started

4
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,320
sort of sound should we get started

5
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,360
i think so

6
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,600
all right

7
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,920
okay welcome everyone you're in the itf

8
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,240
112 dmm working group session

9
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,960
myself shrek navally and my co-chair

10
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,240
satoru

11
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,000
is here

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,880
okay

13
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,799
few things before we get started

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
so if you by attending this meeting

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,239
you're generally agreeing to

16
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,239
follow the etf rules and other

17
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,599
considerations

18
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,840
so these are

19
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,760
the this slide is about the ipr

20
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,480
considerations

21
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,480
and

22
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,840
note well

23
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,959
again

24
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,959
as i said by attending this meeting you

25
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,080
have to

26
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,319
you're confirming that you'll you'll

27
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,920
follow the idea of rules and regulations

28
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,359
these are listed in this uh

29
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,920
guides

30
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,599
a few things

31
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,360
for note taker pablo has agreed to be

32
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,440
the note taker pablo thank you so much

33
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,239
and a quick update on the working group

34
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,360
documents we have currently three

35
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,319
documents that are on the working group

36
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,680
which were adopted as working of

37
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,280
documents

38
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,599
one is the user plane protocol and

39
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,519
architecture analysis

40
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,440
and the segment routing for segment

41
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,319
routing ipv6 for mobile user play

42
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,480
and mobility aware transport network

43
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,879
slicing for 5j

44
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,480
so

45
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,800
a quick update i have not seen uh we

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,400
have not seen much progress on the first

47
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
one between the last meeting and uh this

48
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,920
meeting

49
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,080
uh

50
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,720
so i think

51
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,798
we need we need a new revision

52
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,560
to see where we are

53
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,000
right but right now

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,680
at this point not much progress on this

55
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,879
document

56
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,519
on segment routing for ipv6 we issued a

57
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,879
last call

58
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,440
but there have been few concerns there

59
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,840
have been active discussions

60
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,680
for

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,280
there are a number of comments like you

62
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,920
know i think a few things after the

63
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,280
working group

64
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,840
called close we did not you know send

65
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,640
any text any email on on the outcome of

66
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,080
the call

67
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,280
we thought

68
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,640
because there were a few comments we

69
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,799
thought we let the authors and

70
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,760
those reviewers settle those you know

71
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,360
you know discuss offline and uh converge

72
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,478
on

73
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,519
on on what what the changes should be

74
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,279
so as we speak

75
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,280
the authors other son and others are in

76
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,600
actively in touch with with the

77
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,040
reviewers

78
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,120
joel we know is

79
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,360
one of the reviewer who gave some

80
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,680
specific comments right

81
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,479
our plan is

82
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,520
to really you know make sure the authors

83
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,759
and the reviewers you know agree upon

84
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,960
something in the next you know one month

85
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,479
one month month

86
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,759
and

87
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,120
do a quick

88
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,440
last call again in january

89
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,120
that's the plan

90
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,400
so but right now to give an update the

91
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,479
last working of the lc from the last

92
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,560
thing did not you know we did not feel

93
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,320
we are ready to

94
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,080
take it forward right we there are few

95
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,280
concerns

96
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,639
there is uh

97
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,160
most of the issues are addressed but

98
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,320
still there are few issues we want those

99
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,240
issues to be addressed

100
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,680
as part of the update today the authors

101
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,199
are going to you know talk about the

102
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,120
specific issues you know what are the

103
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,160
blocking comments which are not they'll

104
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,960
let them present give the status on that

105
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,759
i have also spoken to or a area director

106
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,080
eric on this document

107
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,479
so he's also you know

108
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,000
watching the threads

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
carefully so we'll

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,520
but or as i said our plan is to truly

111
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,960
you know make sure all the issues are

112
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,000
resolved

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,320
and we absolutely want to move forward

114
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,880
in january that's that's the plan

115
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,199
now on the next document mobility about

116
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,160
transport network slicing uh this this

117
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,919
is today we again we have presentation

118
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,240
this was adopted recently

119
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,360
so at this point you know we don't have

120
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,280
much to talk about this but

121
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,520
but i think we do want some discussions

122
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,639
in the mailing list on this document

123
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,639
but we'll hear more from john on this on

124
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,080
the progress of this

125
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,680
document

126
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,440
next submission is that there's a new

127
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,280
submission

128
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,680
between the last and iedf meeting and

129
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,120
this one

130
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,720
this is the srv6 mobile user plan

131
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,240
architecture

132
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,120
so there's an individual submission

133
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,360
it's no discussions yet today we are

134
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,600
going to hear from the authors as you

135
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,199
know what they want to

136
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,800
you know on the proposal

137
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,759
with that i think uh i'll pause for a

138
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,080
second and see if there any other

139
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,800
so the agenda for today is like mainly

140
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,600
you know three presentations

141
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,360
uh one from john

142
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,759
from pablo another from satoru so two

143
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,360
working documents and third one the

144
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,199
individual id

145
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,520
so there is one other document that is

146
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
missing as i said the first the other

147
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,919
working document you know the authors

148
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,400
haven't asked for a slot yet we are

149
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,599
going to you know reach out to the

150
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,039
authors and see you know what's going on

151
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,880
on that document

152
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,360
but uh but this is the status

153
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,960
as of today

154
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,240
now

155
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,479
i'll pause here

156
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,120
and see if there any comments otherwise

157
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,240
we'll go with the presentations

158
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,680
all right

159
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,840
i believe

160
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,880
nobody in the queue i'll uh let our

161
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,039

can you

180
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,960
john can you make the request again

181
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,840
please

182
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,919
okay you should have it now sorry

183
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,680
go

184
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,399
yes we can see your slides

185
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,200
oh this is who's sharing oh

186
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,120
by the way shay can you hear me or uh

187
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,399
john you're are you sharing the right

188
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,190
slides

189
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,359
[Music]

190
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,120
you know maybe i'm not

191
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,000
you're sharing if i what i see is a srv6

192
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,800
mobile user plane architecture for

193
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,480
for foreign that's what i see don't even

194
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,920
have that open so

195
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,640
that's strange yeah

196
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,120
sort of any comments what is

197
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,519
what do you guys see inside my screen

198
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,760
who is sharing

199
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,880
all right if that's easier

200
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,680
is that better yeah

201
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,519
i can't figure this out

202
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,839
uh well i've asked for uh permission to

203
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,279
share the screen okay yeah i keep saying

204
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,360
grant grant but i'm not is anybody you

205
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,279
see i'm we are not sharing anything we

206
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,000
can see the srv6 mobile user plane

207
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,480
architecture for dmm slides at the

208
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,320
moment

209
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,760
we are not sharing i'm not sharing

210
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,000
anything so can you try from your side

211
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,320
john you may need to stop sharing first

212
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,519
and then

213
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,519
because you had requested share you may

214
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,519
need to stop sharing the other and then

215
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,800
request

216
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,440
share your content directly

217
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,760
i think that john has a

218
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,600
different

219
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,240
desktop

220
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,160
my

221
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,320
screen yes yes

222
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,000
let me put it in the presentation you

223
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,800
see plenty of windows yeah okay

224
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,720
okay this is good please please continue

225
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,240
okay

226
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,720
good morning and oh good evening to you

227
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,839
all and sorry about the

228
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,600
you know time to take up

229
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,040
to set this up

230
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,880
uh but thanks for attending all of this

231
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,040
and let me let me start with um

232
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,360
saying what what we're doing in this

233
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,360
draft in terms of the updates

234
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,399
um

235
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,600
this these are mostly updates uh based

236
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,640
on comments that we've got um in the

237
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,160
during the adoption call and also from

238
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,320
feedback from related aspects in for

239
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,480
example the routing working group and so

240
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,200
on

241
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,040
um so i've organized it into

242
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,880
four areas

243
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,120
one is a very simple clarification of

244
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,920
that

245
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,279
architecture section the second one is a

246
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,880
little more substantial it's talking

247
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,480
about the

248
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,200
transport endpoint and its relation to

249
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,920
the 3gbp

250
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,680
28541 endpoints

251
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,680
the third one is related mainly to

252
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,399
comments that we got during and before

253
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,120
the

254
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,440
working group

255
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,160
so on so that's the third one and then

256
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,920
we have a few miscellaneous changes

257
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,440
that's uh

258
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,880
you know to make sure that we are

259
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
aligning with the t's working group

260
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,079
draft

261
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,000
those are not really i don't have any

262
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,839
slides to discuss but we've made changes

263
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,200
in the draft

264
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,600
so i'll go on to the first one and

265
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,200
clarify this is a very simple change so

266
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,639
i'll just walk through the diagram i

267
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,519
mean

268
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,519
or rather let me just say the change

269
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,560
that we made is in two section 2

270
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,880
to add that

271
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,600
the this architecture diagram and is

272
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,320
provided here for information

273
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,120
and

274
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,800
we're not making any changes to the

275
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,880
architecture per se it's exactly what's

276
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,800
in 3gpp the g

277
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,519
g node b d u and the cu on the radio

278
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,480
side

279
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,800
you can see over here

280
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,320
the

281
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,560
and and then the

282
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,000
the f1 u which is the equal to the user

283
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,839
plane for

284
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,360
um the intro gpp the g note bcu and the

285
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,959
upf all bounded via the n3 or the n9

286
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,079
connections

287
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,320
all of that is exactly what is in 3gb

288
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,480
will be making your changes to it

289
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,839
what we're

290
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,920
putting in this diagram is a

291
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
clarification on how we're going to use

292
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,519
it in terms of

293
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,279
handling the slicing across these f1u or

294
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,959
n3 and n9

295
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,720
and i think that's the clarification we

296
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,959
provided

297
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,360
going on to the second change this is a

298
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,040
little more detail so i'll walk through

299
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,519
it as in as much as

300
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,720
we can

301
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,800
um so

302
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,399
this uh this change is uh associating

303
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,279
the text in our document with uh some of

304
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,560
the

305
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,600
um

306
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,040
the details in 28541 which is a network

307
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,760
resource model uh management system

308
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,639
network resource model and 3gpp

309
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,880
so i've copied the

310
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,040
the

311
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,120
a small diagram from

312
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,720
28541 which describes the transport

313
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,440
endpoints as logic interface ids and

314
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,120
there's a list of them

315
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,399
and how it relates to the points

316
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,199
in this draft is that you know there are

317
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,120
these

318
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,600
user plane network functions which could

319
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,240
be the gene node b cu i mean you know

320
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,680
bdu

321
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,199
or the upf

322
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,240
um

323
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,480
and

324
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,760
[Music]

325
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,000
this

326
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,399
interface id is what is then used

327
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,160
for

328
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,279
forwarding

329
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,199
or setting up the

330
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,880
uh classifying and setting up the slice

331
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,440
and that is clarified in three areas in

332
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,600
the document there's in the abstract

333
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,800
wave

334
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
uh added some text to that

335
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,519
in the introduction section it refers to

336
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,440
the 28541

337
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,040
and then later on in section 205 of mtnc

338
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,959
id in the data packet

339
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,839
we've again clarified how this is being

340
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,160
used

341
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,959
so if there's any questions on this i

342
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,519
can take it or i'll move on to the next

343
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,839
point

344
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,680
so on the mti ncid for traffic class and

345
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,680
tenant i mean this is

346
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,519
there was some discussion on this there

347
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,240
was there were some questions on

348
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,040
you know how this is related to path and

349
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,399
aspects like that

350
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,720
this this was even before the i think

351
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,399
working group reduction we had made some

352
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,360
changes but uh in in this one the

353
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,480
authors

354
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,380
have worked to

355
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,639
[Music]

356
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,959
really remove all of the

357
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,519
aspects related to tying it to a path

358
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,680
and really what we've

359
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,800
what we now have are traffic classes and

360
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,000
tenants

361
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,440
and

362
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,600
you can see here that

363
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,279
that i mean i've just copied the text

364
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,279
from two with the changes

365
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,959
we've introduced the

366
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,519
notion of the tenants in this and if

367
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,360
there are and the notion that there are

368
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,880
if there are

369
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,040
uh t traffic classes and see

370
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,959
tenants then

371
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,199
yeah it's a function of t by c in a

372
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,360
fully meshed networks and

373
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,320
that

374
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,480
there is enough space to represent that

375
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,160
if you use an identifier of 16 bits

376
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,320
also we removed all the text associating

377
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
a transport slice idea to a path in the

378
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,399
network

379
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,839
um

380
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,240
those are the

381
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,519
so

382
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,519
if i may ask a clarifying question here

383
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,480
right

384
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,320
so the slice

385
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,320
now it's no longer about two end points

386
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,800
a logical you know a logical path

387
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,880
between two end points but you're saying

388
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,839
a

389
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,320
it it's a set of you know nodes on the

390
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,519
transport path

391
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,839
of the change

392
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,319
yeah of the slice is between the two end

393
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,119
points as we clarify here

394
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,240
uh the point is that the identity i mean

395
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,880
associating that identity is with

396
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,280
respect to a tenant

397
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,599
that's using it um so i think this

398
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,599
aligns i mean this aligns more with

399
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,760
what's been happening in the idf

400
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,959
and

401
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,240
does that answer your question or

402
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,400
yeah

403
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,880
[Music]

404
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,760
so

405
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,640
in this context is is what in the idf

406
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,679
context you know is

407
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,360
the the entity that's the controlling

408
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,000
the transport path or is it

409
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,080
can you clarify on that sorry i somehow

410
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,919
missed the first part you know what is

411
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,080
the entity that

412
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,919
the current in this context right you

413
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,679
know where do you define that

414
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,120
maybe i'll use just one of these

415
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,320
the tenant in this case is the one that

416
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,440
is

417
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,440
um

418
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,520
is requesting these services

419
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,120
so you if you have multiple um tenants

420
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,679
then they

421
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,160
you know they would have different um i

422
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,919
uh slice identifiers

423
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,080
okay

424
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,080
right

425
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,120
and so in other words if it is uh to put

426
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,840
the other part uh you know that was

427
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,400
more tricky and that was there before

428
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,960
and was tying it to a path

429
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,720
so if it's the same tenant across

430
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,039
different paths it may still use the

431
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,679
same identifier and it can be resolved

432
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,440
by using the combination of an

433
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,919
identifier and where this is originating

434
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,559
or destined for

435
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,840
i i hope that clarifies that

436
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,799
yeah

437
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,880
okay thank you so

438
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,320
thanks um

439
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,799
um i think this was the these two are

440
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,799
perhaps the most substantial changes in

441
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,039
the text of the others are relatively

442
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,480
minor

443
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,520
so that's actually all that we have for

444
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,160
this draft

445
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,480
um yeah i think that's all

446
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,320
any comments or

447
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,480
suggestions to update we'd be happy to

448
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,559
take them now or on the working on the

449
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,120
mailing list

450
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,360
yeah so thank you john uh any questions

451
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,360
comments

452
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,440
there is uh nobody in the queue so so

453
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,679
john or you know are we requiring any

454
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,240
changes on the n4 interface for this or

455
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,679
yeah can you

456
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,679
right you don't no we're not requiring

457
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,280
any changes in the n4 so to i'll use

458
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,360
this figure again to clarify that

459
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,240
um so what's happening is

460
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,600
so this 28 541 is some interface in the

461
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,320
management system which will

462
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,679
populate the

463
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,679
these endpoints

464
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,559
uh so you know it may be vlan mpls

465
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,799
segment udp port so they're all

466
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,360
identified in this draft and that will

467
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,679
be associated uh in in this uh you know

468
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,960
endpoint

469
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
then

470
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,039
you know how that is mapped

471
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,200
um

472
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,320
is uh

473
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,000
is via this

474
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,679
interface i mean how how this is

475
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,960
populated

476
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,880
so based on where this is destined uh or

477
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,120
originating from and the other

478
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,760
classification it will use this mapping

479
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,720
that is

480
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,440
in here this endpoint transport mapping

481
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,559
and

482
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,360
and that will be used to classify these

483
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,840
the slice and other information in in

484
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,799
this transport network so to the short

485
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,640
answer to your question is there is no

486
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,000
change

487
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,280
to the

488
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,240
smf or the interface between the smf and

489
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,000
the upf at all

490
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,360
okay good to hear that john so i think

491
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,919
just to clarify on the overall scope we

492
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,400
are not truly defining

493
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,880
a on the transport side we are not

494
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,120
introducing the concept of a slice right

495
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,960
but it's just more of a mapping we are

496
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,559
giving an identifier to a particular

497
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,120
transport slice we assume that transport

498
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,280
other working groups would create that

499
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,440
all what we are doing is we are doing an

500
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,520
asso we are associating that slice to a

501
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,919
session in the mobility absolutely is

502
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,080
that is that

503
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,840
that's a very

504
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,720
good abstraction

505
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,640
yeah because one of the concerns at the

506
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,559
time of adoption we did say that is like

507
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,240
you know we don't want to step on other

508
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,760
working groups

509
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,679
there is a gap here because transport

510
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,960
area is already working on bunch of

511
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
stuff in the mobility area we are doing

512
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,799
bunch of things in the session areas in

513
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,120
the session management it's just a

514
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,520
mapping of the two as long as the scope

515
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,600
is within you know stays within that we

516
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,960
are perfectly fine

517
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,280
and uh

518
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,440
thank you john eric eric was on

519
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,360
i believe is trying to say something

520
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,840
eric cline

521
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,200
i think you actually asked my question

522
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,320
it was about whether or not there were

523
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,880
any actual modifications required

524
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
to the uh to the elements to any element

525
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,960
that was implementing into or no no no

526
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,840
changes to endurance for

527
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,600
you know the only changes we can see is

528
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,240
that already in 28 541 these are

529
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,960
the vlan mpls and segment information

530
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,400
already there

531
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,919
i mean we're talking about as we

532
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,360
mentioned you know the association

533
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,720
between the

534
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,840
um

535
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,320
the way we populate a slice in the

536
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,840
transport network to that of the

537
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,039
the slice in the mobile network

538
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,120
so this is a mapping or an association

539
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,840
between them

540
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,760
i'll leave it to the the chairs i assume

541
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,679
you guys are following the other slice

542
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,000
work as you were saying sri and

543
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,360
other other working groups there's

544
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
there's a fair amount of other slice

545
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,799
things going on

546
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,960
and i know that there's a vtn id draft

547
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,120
in six man about trying to

548
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,720
have a network slice id so i don't know

549
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,240
if uh

550
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,000
yeah speak up i guess is what i'm saying

551
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,280
if you if you think there ought to be

552
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,200
some kind of a multi-working group

553
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,960
session where we talk about

554
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,640
slice things across

555
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,960
all the groups that are relevant

556
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,000
i don't know if that's a good idea or

557
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,400
not but

558
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,280
at some point we need to you know make

559
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,880
sure this aligns with the rest of the

560
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,679
work that's happening uh in other groups

561
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,960
eric i think the key thing is currently

562
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,720
this document what whatever this

563
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,640
document is doing is like you know it's

564
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,320
something unique which others are not

565
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,039
focusing here it's mostly about

566
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,039
the how we manage the you know how we

567
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,120
create an association between a session

568
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,200
and a transport slice i think

569
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,080
as long as we stay in that area

570
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,640
and the slices can be of you know other

571
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,080
groups can you know come out with

572
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,000
different idea identifiers and all of

573
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,760
that we should be able to you know we

574
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,600
are not creating a new id but we are

575
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,279
just using one of the id that other

576
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,360
group creates and we are binding it to a

577
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,600
session so if you stay in that i think

578
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,520
we are perfectly fine but

579
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,080
one thing john i think the draft need to

580
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,679
be a little bit you know

581
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,039
as to you know

582
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,200
cover you know reflect these points

583
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,799
currently it's all over the place but if

584
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,640
somebody reads it they may be confused

585
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,400
they might be thinking you guys are

586
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,039
defining a new slice and all of that so

587
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,200
i would suggest you and other other

588
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,360
authors please you know review you know

589
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,679
review the text again and make sure that

590
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,679
you know the the comments okay i think

591
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,000
uh we somewhat agree think as an

592
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,720
as

593
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,880
authors you know we didn't get the time

594
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,279
at this time to update it but i think we

595
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,440
feel the need that we should focus this

596
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
draft to deliver something

597
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,679
of value that can be used

598
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:54,720
in

599
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,400
you know setting up these mobile slices

600
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,840
and only that

601
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,559
um with respect to uh eric's comments

602
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,000
you know i think uh

603
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,480
not me but the other authors are

604
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,159
or some of the other authors are looking

605
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,159
at the tease work and we have tried to

606
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,240
align uh

607
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,840
the text in here

608
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,799
uh or even reference them

609
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,279
i'm not sure that any of us are tracking

610
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,679
the six man specifically for slicing

611
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,000
slices but uh we'll take that as an

612
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
action to look at

613
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,960
um but as tree mentioned i think uh you

614
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,120
know the focus here is

615
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,840
obviously to do the mapping and to a

616
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,679
mobile session

617
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:34,799
that uh

618
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,240
gets

619
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
you know gets uh established and

620
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,880
re-established as a user moves and so

621
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,720
that's sort of

622
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,720
more uh specific to the mobile

623
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,640
environment and we'll try to stick to

624
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,360
only that

625
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,120
okay

626
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,520
so on this i think one final comment on

627
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,679
this john i think if you can refer you

628
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,159
know make sure track all the other uh

629
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,080
work that's happening other groups

630
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,919
add some information informative forces

631
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,640
if it makes sense references right

632
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,039
and uh so that way we can make sure that

633
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,880
the identifiers that you're referring to

634
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,799
or you know we are not

635
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,200
ignoring any here rather you know it's

636
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,279
uh

637
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,520
we are neutral to any of the types right

638
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,320
i think that's that's

639
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,919
yeah to i think eric's last comment at

640
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,440
some point we may have to get this

641
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,279
reviewed by other working groups as well

642
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,840
john so i think we are not ready yet but

643
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,919
let's clean up and that's at some point

644
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,000
as ricky suggesting we may have to do

645
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,240
that sure i've taken these notes and

646
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,279
yeah i'll definitely

647
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,880
work with the other authors to update

648
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,039
this

649
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,960
thank you okay

650
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,240
uh i see uma uma please i see you in the

651
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,640
queue

652
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,640
i had one comment to what eric and you

653
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,400
are saying right so we are following the

654
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,159
peace working group what they are trying

655
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,880
to do and as during the working group

656
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,200
adoption we made sure that we referred

657
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,000
and we because there's a huge discussion

658
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,760
across the idea of like you know a

659
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,080
centralized piece for the technology

660
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,919
because there's a lot of discussion uh

661
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,000
before the buffs and all that happened

662
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
so we wanted to align we want to be the

663
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,559
same page with the technology at least

664
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,799
and also some of the things we mapped to

665
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,120
the t's stuff so we referred explicitly

666
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,480
during the working group adoption based

667
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,600
on the comments so apart from that uh as

668
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,760
the part of the neutral being neutral

669
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,679
yes we are neutral that's one of the

670
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,760
reason when in iedf 105 and eric said

671
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,000
that empty and cid we don't want to put

672
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,600
that into the data plane directly right

673
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,080
so because we need to go touch l2 layer

674
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,200
2 ipv4 ipv6 and sr and pls everything

675
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,279
that's why we took the neutral approach

676
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,159
mtncd we encoded it into the udp ports

677
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,919
but people

678
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,559
further once it's that information is

679
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,039
given to the ip networks then further

680
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,760
they can put encode vtn id is what eric

681
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,559
is mentioning in six man or they can do

682
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,880
all sorts of ideas in uh these whatever

683
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,960
they're trying to do they can do it but

684
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,919
for us end to end we are neutral uh

685
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,320
that's why we backtracked and we put uh

686
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,919
we didn't put empty ncd all over the

687
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,080
place in all data planes actually so

688
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,240
this is the ietf105 discussion captures

689
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,679
that so we're pretty neutral in this

690
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,919
here

691
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,200
thanks okay yeah thank you i was

692
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,240
yeah

693
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,840
i'll just repeat my offer if you think

694
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,600
that there's uh other if you're

695
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,200
satisfied with the current cross-working

696
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,080
group uh awareness and then great and if

697
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,760
not then let me know and i can try to

698
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,679
talk to two other ads and we can figure

699
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,360
out how to do

700
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,720
some multi-working group kind of a

701
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,760
session

702
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,080
sure one more one more question one more

703
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,679
thing for you i think this is uh one of

704
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,440
the routing areas pointed to me offline

705
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,559
messages

706
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,200
uh it was not linked to the individual

707
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,960
draft i think there's some ipr concerns

708
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,200
so i just requested an administrative

709
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,039

758
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,039
so as a brief reminder

759
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,760
so this document went into working group

760
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,679
last call

761
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,200
on april this year on revision 11.

762
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,600
we had a good participation with many

763
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,120
comments so really thank you to everyone

764
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,880
who has reviewed and and many thanks as

765
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,799
well for eric that uh

766
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,039
that actually also posted the working

767
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,960
group last call to spring as well

768
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,880
um and so during the working group last

769
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,039
call we have issued several updates so

770
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,039
actually we're on revision 17

771
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,320
um with

772
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,919
to address the comments from the

773
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,279
reviewers

774
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,360
um and there have been many editorial

775
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,600
points as well as technical comments

776
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,080
um which i think has been very positive

777
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,120
okay

778
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,200
there are still i believe

779
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,240
a couple of uh items that we should look

780
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,159
at before we conclude the adoption so

781
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,600
there is one email thread that i will

782
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,679
discuss later and another point on the

783
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,640
relationship of this work with other

784
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,240
items and so basically on the next

785
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,679
slides what i will do is i will try to

786
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,919
highlight these points

787
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:04,880
okay

788
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,919
um

789
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,640
so the the first comment and this is in

790
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,440
chronological order um so the the one of

791
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,760
the first relevant comments that we got

792
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,559
it was actually from joel harper and

793
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,640
it was related to the relationship of

794
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,200
this work with 3gbp

795
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,240
um i've put in there the email

796
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,360
link the url for the email from joel

797
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,679
but if i'm not mistaken i think that

798
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,679
joel's point is that he believes there

799
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,000
is a conflict in between three sections

800
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,679
of this draft

801
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,840
with a work that is being defined in

802
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,559
3gbp

803
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,960
the authors have quite a different point

804
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,559
of view because what we believe is that

805
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,559
we are defining the tool or the data

806
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,120
plane and this data plane can be used by

807
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,760
any other um entity or sdo such as for

808
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,919
example the 3gbp so basically we are not

809
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,399
trying to deprecate gdpu which is owned

810
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,640
by 3gbp

811
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,240
but joel is still

812
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,159
feels that there is a conflict and this

813
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,480
is one of the outstanding items that we

814
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,679
should discuss and that we should

815
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,000
resolve

816
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,039
there have been um a few more comments

817
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,600
so we got um quite a bunch of editorial

818
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,640
changes uh from jerk and

819
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,720
actually uh it was very nice that they

820
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,480
gave us the div so we actually applied

821
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,799
it and we also had discussion with john

822
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,039
on terminology particularly on the l2

823
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,679
adjacency which we also resolved

824
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,000
as rita also actually asked us whether

825
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,880
this draft should also cover the dx2 and

826
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,760
the f1u interface considerations

827
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,960
okay

828
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,640
so basically the way that we resolve

829
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,960
that is that is not covered in this

830
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,559
draft we believe it is out of the scope

831
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,159
of this draft but it is covered in the

832
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,240
draft murakami dmm user play message

833
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,279
encoding so we added a reference to that

834
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,840
draft

835
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,720
um and then there has been a quite an

836
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,440
extensive email exchange with jeff which

837
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,039
has been really good

838
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,000
um

839
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,240
and this has been editorial points and

840
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,760
clarifications throughout all of the

841
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,760
texts and

842
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,039
um

843
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,320
just point

844
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,079
the technical points he had a lot of

845
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,599
comments on the relationship in between

846
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,440
the traditional and the enhanced modes

847
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,040
and and whether they could be merged or

848
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,839
not

849
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,239
and we also had a lot of clarifications

850
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,679
on the scalability concerns scalability

851
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,159
concentrations that we on the draft

852
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,599
then there have been a lot of discussion

853
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,520
on the addressing

854
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,199
and actually this

855
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,040
is because in the examples that we use

856
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,280
throughout the draft we are using

857
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,320
other things like u1 tid which is not

858
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
a correct ipv6 address in my opinion so

859
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,320
we are trying to see how we tackle that

860
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,760
and maybe i think that the most

861
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,199
straightforward option would be that we

862
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,560
just use the

863
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,359
documentation ipv6 block

864
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,359
and then we we have an ongoing email

865
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,879
spread with jeff uh that is um

866
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,280
revolving quite a slowly on both of our

867
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,440
sites um but he's progressing quite good

868
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,440
um and i believe that jeff just sent his

869
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,119
last email one hour before this meeting

870
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,720
so i don't know what was the content of

871
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,240
email but we are making quite a good

872
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,680
progress with jeff

873
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,800
um

874
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,880
so all in all i think that um

875
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,119
so basically i think that we will be in

876
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,440
pretty good shape uh for all of the

877
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,119
comments i think the major point that

878
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,119
will be outstanding it will be the

879
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,800
comment from joel and the relationship

880
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,920
that this work has with 3gbp

881
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,160
the points from jeff still need to be

882
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,000
finalized we have not closed all of them

883
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,760
and once we have closed this and then

884
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
hopefully we can move forward with this

885
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,119
draft

886
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,560
so that's all many thanks to everyone

887
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,720
who has contributed when i see jeff on

888
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,079
the queue

889
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,560
yeah so pablo i think if you go back to

890
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,480
the previous two slides one of the

891
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,000
slides here

892
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,040
which one so yeah let's start here let's

893
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,960
stay here so

894
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,560
out of these four

895
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,079
you know comments like in our reviewer

896
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,920
comments which are blocking comments

897
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,680
versus which are like more editorial in

898
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,200
nature

899
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,920
so i i think the derrick john and srider

900
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,000
they have been already closed

901
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,200
um i think joel comment is

902
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,599
blocking well in the sense that it needs

903
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,320
to

904
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,720
we need to have discussion perhaps i

905
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,920
don't know if it's at working group

906
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,000
level or whether it should happen at a

907
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,359
higher level

908
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,200
um to see what is the relationship of

909
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,520
this work with 3gbp so i believe that

910
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,160
from this slide only joel's point is the

911
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,359
one that needs a special attention

912
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,119
okay but uh so

913
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,880
you know how do you you know what's the

914
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,560
what are the next steps like you know we

915
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,640
want to you know see some convergence on

916
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,760
this right

917
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,560
so

918
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,280
you know did you guys give up on this or

919
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,320
are you guys still talking

920
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,040
i think we need to have a further

921
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,200
discussion um i think it would be

922
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,359
interesting to get the point of view of

923
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,680
more working group participants or if

924
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,400
not

925
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,839
at least the point of view of the 80s

926
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,599
i think there are several options to

927
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,040
resolve this

928
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,320
um

929
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,560
but still i think we need to hear a bit

930
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,480
more voices

931
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,960
so well i believe joel joel is on the

932
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,920
joel from your point of view will you be

933
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,560
able to summarize your key blocking

934
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,079
comments and posted the working group

935
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,200
that way

936
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,320
you know because

937
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
if you guys are not able to resolve it

938
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,079
and like to get you know more broader

939
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,560
feedback and uh find some consensus

940
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,359
there

941
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,960
so will you be able to yeah yeah speaker

942
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,560
um i sent them to the list i i'll assume

943
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,160
that the archive pointer is the right

944
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,280
one

945
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,680
but i i'll restate them i mean satoru

946
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,480
asked to talk to me as an author i was i

947
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,200
did so i restated them there

948
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,000
the the this document has four

949
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
alternatives it spells out

950
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,920
three of them change the behavior of the

951
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,480
g node b and or the upf

952
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,040
that's the domain of 3gpp

953
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,560
one of them

954
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,720
says use srv6s tunnels to connect gtp

955
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,280
the genome b and upf

956
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,320
carrying the gtp etc and so forth as we

957
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,640
do with tunnels hey tunnels i got no

958
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,119
problem with that's absolutely valid you

959
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,079
want to describe that go ahead

960
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,720
but the other three cases

961
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,800
are changing interfaces that are

962
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,520
standardized by 3gpp

963
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,320
and

964
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,720
that is not the ietf's business

965
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,079
we expect folks to respect the ip

966
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,000
standardization we do not to change ipv6

967
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,880
not to change mpls we had a major fight

968
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,599
with itu-t to keep them from changing

969
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,000
the way mpls worked

970
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,119
so

971
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,119
if we expect other people to respect our

972
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,240
work

973
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,480
we owe it to them to respect

974
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,079
their work

975
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,320
and my understanding of our processes

976
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,839
are we don't go redefining other

977
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,520
people's architectures

978
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,079
dmm can define alternative architectures

979
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,839
completely not saying it's redefining

980
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,200
3gpp

981
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
different topic

982
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,960
if you want to define a whole mobility

983
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,200
architecture using

984
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,240
mobile

985
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,480
mobile ip we did that there's probably

986
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,800
room to refine it that's our business

987
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,240
but we can't go redefining 3gpp i've

988
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,200
been very clear on that with the ideas

989
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,640
with the authors with the working group

990
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,320
i don't know what to say beyond that

991
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,760
joel just one comment if i may

992
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,680
i understand your point however i

993
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,119
believe at the beginning of this

994
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,359
document we have particularly written in

995
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,520
the draft and i quote the user plane

996
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,359
describing this document does not depend

997
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,000
on any specific architecture

998
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,440
and so basically what we are meaning

999
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,040
with this text is that we are not

1000
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,839
redefining what 3gbp is doing we are not

1001
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,760
redefining 3gbp

1002
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,200
interfaces

1003
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,480
you say that but it isn't but then the

1004
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,119
document does redefine it

1005
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,680
saying it doesn't make it true

1006
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,240
the document redefines the behavior of

1007
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,680
genode b's and upfs as to how they send

1008
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,119
and receive ip packets

1009
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,240
that's

1010
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,680
changing three

1011
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,680
specifications

1012
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,680
so i got it uh joel uh pablo i think

1013
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,520
that's what you asked

1014
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,520
that's why i made sure i was here for

1015
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,599
this so you could so i could tell you

1016
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,079
where i'm coming from you guys you

1017
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,000
particularly as chair since satoru is a

1018
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,440
co-author

1019
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,440
have to deal with what do you want to do

1020
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,760
with it

1021
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,000
no i'll just you know i think the others

1022
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,280
in the queue but i'll just make one

1023
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,880
comment here uh

1024
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,319
yes in in principle i completely agree

1025
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,160
with your view joel

1026
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,040
we are

1027
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,800
our it's not our business to change the

1028
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,160
gbp architecture however we can define

1029
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,280
alternative interfaces like

1030
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,760
six and three srv6n9 these are all the

1031
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,599
options i think we had to absolutely

1032
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,760
make sure you know we are not saying you

1033
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,079
know 3gbp says something and iv idf says

1034
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,920
by then no no we do it differently

1035
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,000
that's absolutely not the intent and

1036
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,440
from what i understand even the authors

1037
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,200
are not saying that but let's see you

1038
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,880
know where the confusion is how to

1039
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,079
resolve that but uh but in principle i

1040
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,319
agree with your comments search or

1041
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,640
uh we'll let others speak up in the

1042
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,920
queue yeah

1043
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,079
it's all

1044
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,800
um so i show up as a childhood uh but i

1045
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,200
am the jeffrey who has been making the

1046
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,119
all those email exchanges with pablo um

1047
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,160
um

1048
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,960
so

1049
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,000
yeah hi um

1050
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,839
about the the uh relationship with 3gpp

1051
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,520
my thinking is that um

1052
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,480
if we are not uh changing the

1053
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,119
into for signaling

1054
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,160
and as long as from uh the rest of the

1055
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,960
3gb uh mobile system point of view

1056
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,960
that's uh the genome b and upfdr

1057
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,920
they are taking the m2 m4 signaling and

1058
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,200
uh

1059
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,000
and then and to set to send traffic

1060
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,280
um

1061
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,160
then as long as the the uh

1062
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,280
the boxes uh the gmlb or upf they can

1063
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,680
talk to each other or in a particular

1064
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,000
deployment scenario

1065
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,599
that should be fine

1066
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,800
that's why

1067
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,760
i while i share the concern with the

1068
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,920
competition with uh while stepping onto

1069
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,200
three

1070
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,560
toes i'm that's why i have

1071
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,160
even though i have that concern i'm

1072
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,040
still i've been still i still have been

1073
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,560
uh uh

1074
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,800
making all those comments to work on the

1075
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,680
technical and editorial improvements of

1076
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,880
the document

1077
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,079
so i think

1078
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,119
the important thing here is that

1079
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,920
we do not change 3gpp architecture we do

1080
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,160
not change 3gpp

1081
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,800
signaling and then for a particular

1082
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,640
operator if they wanted to to deploy uh

1083
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,240
srv6 tunnel uh uh as long as they can

1084
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,640
ensure the interoperability based on

1085
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,480
n2m4 signaling

1086
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,920
um that should be fine

1087
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,760
now going back to the uh

1088
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,560
technical and editorial or comments

1089
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,680
um

1090
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,079
there was two

1091
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,800
emails thread outstanding

1092
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,640
earlier i sent a response on one of the

1093
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,880
threads before the meeting there is

1094
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,760
another one i haven't replied yet

1095
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,920
i think we have resolved pretty much the

1096
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,440
major technical

1097
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,880
issues

1098
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,560
there are there is

1099
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,839
one

1100
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,880
issue remaining that i think it's good

1101
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,680
to

1102
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,119
uh to point out the option of uh

1103
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,280
doing the drop-in

1104
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,240
mode without using the special

1105
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,119
uh dropping end behavior

1106
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,040
i think we can still continue that

1107
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,240
discussion

1108
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,560
and then another major

1109
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,240
editorial point is that

1110
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,800
i still think it's

1111
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,079
good and it's better to use uh

1112
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,800
u1 colon current gid

1113
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,720
instead of using a

1114
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,079
uh

1115
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,400
the 2001

1116
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,319
blah blah blah that address

1117
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,760
because we are what we are doing here is

1118
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,880
indeed encoding the tid in the ipv6

1119
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,359
address it's better to

1120
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,160
to get to that point so that everybody

1121
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,680
understands what uh uh what it is

1122
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,720
a lot of confusion actually comes from

1123
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,960
the fact that we're not using the u1

1124
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,480
quantum quality id so moving away from

1125
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,760
that is actually make it worse

1126
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,800
so those are my comments here

1127
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,880
so first thing jeffrey you know

1128
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,920
i saw

1129
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,680
lots of you know postings from you i

1130
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,440
appreciate that we did a very thorough

1131
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,400
review

1132
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,720
this is really what is needed i

1133
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,960
absolutely you know thank you for

1134
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,200
it's uh very much appreciated and i

1135
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,280
think uh yeah please uh

1136
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,040
work with the authors and uh you know

1137
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,240
let's uh close the remaining open issues

1138
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,160
so that we can move forward now jeffrey

1139
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,760
all

1140
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:33,359
right just wanted to understand whether

1141
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:34,720
or not um

1142
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,400
the three examples that joel is

1143
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,319
concerned about uh

1144
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,119
are

1145
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,520
uh still normative uh it seems to me

1146
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,040
from the chat that uh they're still

1147
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,400
listed as being normative and i'm

1148
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,280
wondering why they need to be normative

1149
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,359
can they be an example of what somebody

1150
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,800
who wanted to do something different

1151
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,240
uh

1152
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,040
you know in an appendix would that be

1153
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,640
satisfactory i mean people who are going

1154
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,800
to do it are going to do it

1155
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,720
anyway does it need to be a normative

1156
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,119
part of the that ietf document

1157
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,560
i don't know if that ameliorates the

1158
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,119
situation

1159
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,440
eric i i had some discussion with

1160
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,160
sartorius on this maybe i'll let sort of

1161
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,160
sound pablo speak up on

1162
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,960
their current views

1163
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,800
so eric i think that the core of this

1164
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,560
document or really what should be a

1165
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,040
standardized is section

1166
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,640
six if i'm not mistaking that is where

1167
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,319
we are actually defining

1168
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,280
the srv6 segment endpoint behaviors

1169
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,000
uh that win responsibility the section

1170
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,079
five which it is explaining the

1171
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,040
deployment scenarios

1172
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,720
to me um

1173
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,359
honestly it is not normative i would say

1174
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:50,800
i mean to me the normative piece is the

1175
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,560
behaviors that is what we need to

1176
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,000
standardize

1177
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,160
um how an operator is going to deploy

1178
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,960
this um we are proposing three behaviors

1179
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,960
with three modes or four modes in the

1180
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,119
track but actually an operator might

1181
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,720
decide to do even something different

1182
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,680
from this

1183
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,920
um so to me as long as we standardize

1184
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,800
the behaviors we are good um

1185
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,800
section number five does not need to be

1186
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,920
normative am i

1187
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,160
so would it um i don't know if jill's

1188
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,839
still uh

1189
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,680
in this session or if he's moved on to

1190
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,839
other sessions but

1191
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:26,960
um would it would it suffice to uh

1192
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,520
to state clearly that the examples given

1193
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,960
are non-normative and they are

1194
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,359
explicitly for uh

1195
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,680
folks who want to deviate from the 3gp

1196
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,680
architecture in this way

1197
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,359
i agree that section six is what you

1198
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,000
want to publish but if um

1199
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,599
we can't find a way to get around some

1200
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:44,960
of the issues in section five then the

1201
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,559
whole of the document is held up right

1202
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:47,839
so

1203
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:51,040
uh maybe i'd have to say text to know

1204
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,880
i i there might be a path down there

1205
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,040
it doesn't seem likely but

1206
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,960
more unlikely things have come to pass

1207
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,920
so

1208
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,280
there may be a path like that

1209
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,720
all right well maybe i'll take it maybe

1210
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,160
i'll take a stab at sending some text

1211
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:08,960
then

1212
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,400
i guess

1213
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,160
how about that

1214
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,440
but my

1215
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,559
put my text where my mouth is

1216
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,880
uh any other comments i think yeah just

1217
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,559
moving on uh i think pablo if you can

1218
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,079
get another few more minutes on your

1219
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,000
other comments just please go back to

1220
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,800
other slides please

1221
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,520
so okay we talked about joel's comments

1222
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,119
we talked about jeffrey's comments the

1223
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,440
others you know swedish you know i think

1224
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,839
x2 and f1 you that's no long that's not

1225
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,200
in scope

1226
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,880
i agree with you right what else is

1227
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,400
remaining uh pablo

1228
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,880
so from this slide nothing else then the

1229
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,400
rest of the comments are the ones from

1230
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,680
jeff and i think jeff summarized quite

1231
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,839
well

1232
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,640
the other standing points

1233
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,760
very good so let's please work offline

1234
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,240
with all of these reviewers and please

1235
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,800
try to you know like i said i would like

1236
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,680
to see

1237
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,400
you know we want to issue again a short

1238
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,000
lc again in january so please help us

1239
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,640
make that happen

1240
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,839
okay thank you very much

1241
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,680
thank you pablo and all the authors

1242
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,240
appreciate it

1243
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:27,440
and

1244
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,480
one

1245
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,319
other final presentation last

1246
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:31,839
presentation it's a this is a new

1247
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:35,200
document that uh center is published

1248
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,319
so

1249
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:37,680
please

1250
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,960
thank you introduce the topic

1251
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,760
oh yeah i can hear you

1252
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,240
can i see my screen

1253
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,479
yes

1254
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,520
um

1255
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,839
this is saturday from softbank uh j hat

1256
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,440
off um

1257
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,200
hi today i present a service mobile

1258
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:28,199
[Music]

1259
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,520
from intel

1260
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,359
so um almost all contents be available

1261
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,839
on the draft i

1262
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:51,359
the first submit actually we explain the

1263
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:54,640
very uh

1264
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,680
did

1265
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,040
uh concept of the architecture uh by

1266
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,760
texas but the second submit

1267
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,839
zero one version today i submit i

1268
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:06,480
explain illustration

1269
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,559
so um

1270
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,640
sorry for the uh

1271
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,640
the submission right before the meeting

1272
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,119
but i think it'd be helpful to

1273
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:16,559
understand the

1274
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:19,440
the architecture how it works um

1275
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,280
today i

1276
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,359
present

1277
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,559
using powerpoint slide

1278
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:29,680
with the the picture

1279
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,640
so

1280
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,720
you can see the picture

1281
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,440
for the uh

1282
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,480
for example

1283
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,079
the deployment of the uh five 3gb 5g

1284
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,000
network

1285
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,160
using the uh

1286
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,839
upf uh base station general b here and

1287
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,880
the rdn on right

1288
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,240
on the right

1289
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,160
in between them

1290
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,559
the network exists to provide ip

1291
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,160
connectivity

1292
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,760
for the interface defined in the cpp

1293
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,720
you can see anything network here

1294
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,400
and n6 network here

1295
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,280
that's a typical uh picture

1296
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,720
to show this

1297
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,640
the cpp 5g user play architecture

1298
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,200
okay

1299
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,359
now um

1300
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,839
this is an example

1301
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:24,760
of how

1302
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,640
implementation

1303
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,400
for 5g user plane on sr under ray

1304
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,440
many people talk about

1305
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,839
segment routing how

1306
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:36,559
is

1307
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,400
underrated

1308
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,440
for the

1309
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,000
cpp mobile user plane

1310
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,839
so this is one

1311
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:48,160
example one operator can

1312
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,520
deploy

1313
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,119
a cpp

1314
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,800
network

1315
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,480
to proprietary connectivity

1316
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,960
do this

1317
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,800
so one vessel network uh

1318
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,119
consists of the many of the services

1319
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,280
node

1320
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,040
accommodate the above for example

1321
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,800
for instance ram

1322
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,920
and to

1323
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,599
connect

1324
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:18,960
access point

1325
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,319
general b

1326
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:24,079
and ncupf both

1327
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,640
to communicate with the base station

1328
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,480
and on the other side

1329
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,510
n6vp of both

1330
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,920
[Music]

1331
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,119
connected to the upf n6 interface then

1332
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,960
provide connectivity to dm

1333
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:42,960
through the

1334
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,599
n6d and both

1335
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,680
that's one of the

1336
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,640
examples how to deploy

1337
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,559
5g network on top of the cell network

1338
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,520
okay

1339
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,559
so

1340
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,839
when we see this picture we can imagine

1341
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,960
how the packet goes through

1342
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,920
so

1343
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,119
this way

1344
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,960
the packet

1345
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,119
goes through the

1346
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,880
base station access network

1347
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:18,800
from and to the upf then upf uh

1348
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,440
processor packet then for the packet to

1349
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,040
the

1350
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,440
israel network is our network for the

1351
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,640
packet to ddn

1352
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,839
and vice versa

1353
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,799
so one

1354
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:40,240
even the cpp network deploy one single

1355
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,520
cell network the packet be terminated

1356
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,280
once or twice

1357
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,319
at the point of the anchor

1358
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,400
that's one of the example

1359
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,359
of the deployment

1360
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:55,359
for 5g network on top of the cell

1361
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:56,640
network

1362
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,879
okay

1363
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,720
so now um

1364
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,280
here we are promoting srvcmup

1365
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,960
architecture

1366
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,520
in that architecture we can see the data

1367
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,559
path

1368
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,760
for five user plane

1369
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,400
nothing changed on the fcp architecture

1370
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,559
but the sl network can forward the

1371
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:21,839
packet

1372
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:26,799
goes through the n3 and a6 directory

1373
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,760
this is the

1374
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,760
one of the year's

1375
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,160
solution to provide optimized way how to

1376
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,319
optimize the paths

1377
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,799
for the plane

1378
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:41,440
to guarantee the

1379
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,559
minimum

1380
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:45,760
latency and

1381
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,680
other

1382
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,160
feature which is sigma drafting

1383
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,839
for traffic engine

1384
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:52,640
and

1385

1387
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:59,960
for the user plan path

1388
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,680
so this slide shows the service mobile

on left side

1391
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,520
you can see the control frame

1392
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,839
control plane is consists of the

1393
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,680
mep controller

1394
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:24,480
and mep gateway and mvpe

1395

pgp is a protocol that's

1396
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,400
adopted in this architecture document

1397
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,920
but no not limited to

1398
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,520
in the control plane side

1399
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,839
to discovery route exchange between the

1400

to gateway

1418
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,079
you can see the detail in the

1419
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,480
draft

1420
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,960
on right side

1421
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,839
the data plane cpp

1422
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,680
is for example

1423
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,040
um

1424
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,680
sr network have a gateway and a pe

1425
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,359
but um

1426
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:49,599
get other

1427
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:50,960
sr node

1428
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,079

to keep the scpp

1432
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,160
architecture as it did

1433
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,920
so in the mvp gateway this picture

1434
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,520
there's two

1435
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:16,559
buffs configured one is n3rom

1436
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:17,520
for

1437
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,559
the z node b the another

1438
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:21,760
dn

1439
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,200
to import the dn route

1440
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,200
on

1441
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,599
mepp side

1442
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:34,359
the p holds the above for n6dm

1443
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,319
that's the uh

1444
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:40,559
overview for the architecture on both of

control plane protocol adopt pgp but not

1447
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:49,760
limited to and data frame picture just

1448
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,200
for example

1449
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,760
four or five is using cpp

1450
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,799
term

1451
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:57,839
but not limited to

1452
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,400
so

1453
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,000
let's try to explain some use case

1454
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,760
which is a new content on the latest

1455
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,040
version

1456
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,880
described in the illustration section

1457
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,599
please find the detail in that

1458
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:19,799
the text in the draft

1459
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,720
i'll show the

1460
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,880
the picture to explain

1461
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,280
the illustration

1462
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,319
using this slide

1463
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,119
so the how the i service can be provide

1464
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,000
the optimized paths for

1465
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,559
each of the distributed cloud and make

1466
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:40,400
side

1467
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,640
that's the assumption for this use case

1468
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:48,000
so on the

1469
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,040
left side you can see the green mep

1470
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,920
gateway and pe

1471
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,640
the this sr node

1472
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:01,799
holds the above functionality of the mep

1473
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:03,040
the

1474
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,960
n3 round buff

1475
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,920
accommodates the argento b

1476
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,160
with the half

1477
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:15,040
the base slope b prefix

1478
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,400
another verb

1479
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,400
for n6dm

1480
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,240
to accommodate dn site which have the e3

1481
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,720
prefix

1482
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,720
genodb supports

1483
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,440
provides a connectivity to ue

1484
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,799
for prefix use ratio

1485
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:39,760
that's the condition of the access side

1486
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,520
of the mvpk3 and pe

1487

can communicate to each other

1547
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,559
it's not depends on the mep architecture

1548
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,960
it's just normal a service vpn

1549

future

1550
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,280
okay

1551
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,760
next slide uh this picture shows the

1552
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,240
equivalent network model using the cpp

1553
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,960
connector protector

1554
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,839
in

1555
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:47,039
the

1556
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,680
data architecture

1557
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,039
to make sure the the equivalent network

1558
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,920
for previous slide we have to deploy the

1559
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,839
two upf on each side

1560
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:04,720
in between the n69 exists

1561
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,240
the list

1562
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,720
upf

1563
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,440
accommodate the dn through the n6

1564
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,920
network

1565
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,839
on the other upf

1566
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,720
uh accommodate dn another dn through

1567
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,039
another dn60

1568
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,079
that's the equivalent network model to

1569
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:27,520
previous slide

1570
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,640
in cgpp model

1571
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:37,039
here you can see the use case second use

1572
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,000
case

1573
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,160
actually it's same in this case but the

1574
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,720
uh uh

1575
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:45,520
the

1576
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,680
h site is this

1577
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,280
another p e

1578
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,520
i mean so multiple uh dn side uh

1579
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:57,839
supported by multiple sr node

1580
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,200
in this case uh

1581
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,880
mep gateway doesn't need to import us

1582
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:11,039
ue route in the n16 above because it

1583
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,359
just only provides the uplink path in

1584
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:15,839
the above

1585
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,440
return path is the uh

1586
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,119
provided by

1587
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,599
a service mobilizer frame

1588
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:26,079
function

1589
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,680
not depends on the buff or n6dn

1590
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:37,839
the the configuration is almost same on

1591
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,599
mepp

1592
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:41,920
in so3

1593
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,440
but in this case

1594
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,799
s4 appear

1595
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:47,599
to

1596
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:49,440
accommodate the

1597
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,680
edge side dn

1598
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,399
e slash e

1599
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,119
for that configuration mvp control

1600
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:01,839
advertise the ue route

1601
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:02,640
to

1602
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,880
n6d and buff

1603
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,400
on s3 and l4 but not

1604
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,119
not needed to the

1605
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:13,599
s1

1606
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,680
buff

1607
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,240
mvp control also the bottle up route

1608
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,359
to gateway to be imported to the ns3

1609
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:27,759
number

1610
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,240
the route between the n6dn in each

1611
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,959
sr node

1612
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,799
imported and exported each other

1613
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:42,240
to make sure the

1614
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,720
uplink path

1615
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,000
let's show the uh another deployment

1616
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
case for to

1617
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,359
host the edge site

1618
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,520
the decider

1619
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,720
exists on the uh

1620
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,119
in additional is

1621
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,119
sr node

1622
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:08,799
that's different from the previous case

1623
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:10,720
in this case um

1624
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,720
there's no need to import ui route in

1625
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:16,480
mpp gateway so it's that may immediately

1626
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,200
deployment uh be

1627
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,640
simple and not to import much of the eu

1628
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,960
route

1629
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,119
into the above

1630
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:28,559
that's helpful for make sure the

1631
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:31,280
scalability

1632
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,839
so um equivalent network model using the

1633
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:38,240
chpp architecture model architecture

1634
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:42,038
picture um

1635
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,359
this

1636
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:46,480
use case also need two upf

1637
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,680
for each of the dnsi

1638
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,240
and in between upf

1639
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,799
and three network exists between z not b

1640
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:58,520
and upf on left side and right side

1641
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,079
[Music]

1642
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:03,359
to sr and 6 network which is to support

1643
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:04,240
the

1644
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,839
dm side

1645
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:09,520
double double and the setup is e

1646
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,240
from each of the upl

1647
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,839
that's the equivalent network model

1648
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:20,719
so um that's a brief explain how the

1649
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:23,040
service semipenet architecture

1650
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:27,040
works for example using a cpp network

1651
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,359
model

1652
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,719
this is not to intend to change any of

1653
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:34,479
the another seo

1654
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:37,520
specification architecture model

1655
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,839
just to

1656
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,679
respond to

1657
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:46,000
fulfill the requirement for the dmm

1658
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:48,719
using the

1659
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:50,719
segment routing

1660
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:52,640
b6

1661
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,000
from the

1662
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,839
mobile user plane aspect

1663
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:00,158
all of the uh

1664
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:02,238
the background and

1665
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:05,359
the what's the requirement are certified

1666
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:08,319
in dmm is already described in the

1667
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:10,080
introduction section

1668
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,520
in the drafts so please read it

1669
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,560
so after you read the document i really

1670
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,520
happy if you have any interest

1671
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,759
and

1672
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:24,080
if the working group

1673
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,920
in favor i'd like to ask the working

1674
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,719
world adoption

1675
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:32,719
that was my side my presentation

1676
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,520
thank you

1677
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,880
so

1678
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,439
couple of comments i think before i ask

1679
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:41,198
the working group

1680
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:42,719
so

1681
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:45,439
can we say that this scope is strictly

1682
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:47,439
on n6

1683
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:49,279
the steering is more from the data

1684
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:51,600
network is that did i get that is my

1685
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,198
understanding correct the steering is

1686
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:54,238
more

1687
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:56,320
on the n6

1688
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,600
rather than on the core network

1689
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,880
interfaces

1690
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,440
or n3 or

1691
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,950
i don't think uh

1692
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,880
[Music]

1693
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,600
we have a appropriate uh

1694
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,560
the term defined in cpp because it's not

1695
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,080
cpp architecture

1696
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:17,520
but this is the idea of architecture one

1697
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,640
of the right actors shall be defined

1698
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,679
for mobile user plane

1699
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,640
but um yes um the gtp is assumed to

1700
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,960
terminate on the gateway

1701
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,440
after that the uh

1702
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,239
the pack in the packet handled by

1703
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:39,280
isr network

1704
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,400
just to when the essential information

1705
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,760
come from the

1706
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:46,640
mobile

1707
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,280
mobility management system

1708
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,880
it

1709
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,679
totally depends on the how

1710
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:55,040
what's the

1711
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,050
operator what the other seo architecture

1712
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:00,159
[Music]

1713
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:01,920
integrates

1714
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,520
the this

1715
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,640
mep architecture

1716
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:12,678
the sap smep just provides the interface

1717
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,120
for the user frame packet user plane

1718
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,400
traffic

1719
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,199
to be handled

1720
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,520
okay

1721
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,640
so 3gpp does not recognize anything on

1722
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,320
the north of the

1723
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,480
of the upf 196 right they don't

1724
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,320
recognize any node right

1725
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,719
yeah at least nothing changed on cgp

1726
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:35,920
side

1727
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:36,719
yeah

1728
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:40,760
that's good that's good

1729
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,080
so there is the related two other

1730
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,719
documents the mfa document that i worked

1731
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,280
on for some reason i did not follow up

1732
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,960
on that right

1733
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,840
it's also about steering right it's like

1734
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,840
you know anchorless mobility how do you

1735
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,199
steer

1736
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:59,759
directly

1737
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,920
right

1738
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,920
that's one draft

1739
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,920
i think i'd like to ask the relation

1740
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,280
like the

1741
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,280
level of overlap with this and although

1742
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,440
marco is the draft we're all you know i

1743
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,880
we discussed on

1744
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,360
on defining something on n6 steering the

1745
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,920
idea of n6 steering which does not want

1746
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:18,719
to do

1747
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:19,920
they're very clear you will not

1748
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,679
recognize anything on on the north of

1749
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:23,040
upf right

1750
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,960
it perfectly falls in you know you know

1751
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,199
oscar but but those two documents the

1752
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:28,640
relation to this any comments of that

1753
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,640
sort of song

1754
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:31,760
yeah i

1755
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,360
uh i really like mfa id and i really

1756
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:38,880
like the uh mobility idea from marco um

1757
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,960
so the uh

1758
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,239
but um

1759
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,560
somehow the uh

1760
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,640
uh

1761
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,960
those two drops are uh haven't been

1762
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,840
maintained but

1763
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,040
while i

1764
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,199
i work on the service mobile user plan

1765
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:56,000
um

1766
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,600
deployed

1767
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,320
a service network

1768
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,040
in my uh employees

1769
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,960
network

1770
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,239
that's the

1771
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:09,040
my uh

1772
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,000
relation latest proposal

1773
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,600
to provide optimized password to

1774
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,920
uh fulfill the dmm requirement

1775
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:21,840
yeah

1776
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,760
so well i think the

1777
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:28,159
mfa uh supposed to use the fpc

1778
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:29,120
but

1779
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,760
also the this architecture

1780
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,120
can adopt ftc as a northbound of the mup

1781
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,120
controller

1782
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,840
but not too limited too

1783
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,159
nowadays we have a bunch of the

1784
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:44,000
candidate

1785
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,120
[Music]

1786
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,320
using the open source

1787
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,640
anything possible on

1788
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,679
grpc based

1789
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,320
transaction

1790
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,280
i think yeah you know fpc is one

1791
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,440
interface between the

1792
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,040
controller and the

1793
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,640
data plane element but

1794
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,159
yeah like you said there could be

1795
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:09,920
alternative interfaces

1796
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,239
i think yeah these work can be neutral

1797
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,360
to this

1798
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,719
uh yeah i think

1799
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:17,520
in my opinion this has a individual

1800
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,080
i see i think this has value but let's

1801
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:20,960
see

1802
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,440
what others think you know let's collect

1803
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,679
some feedback if anybody has read the

1804
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:27,040
document

1805
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,280
any questions comments this is again

1806
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,960
this is not a working document this is

1807
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,400
just a individual submission at this

1808
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,360
point

1809
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,159
but i think let's uh if anybody has any

1810
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:39,040
questions comments

1811
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,320
please speak up

1812
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:43,360
i see some uh people in the queue uh

1813
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,040
john

1814
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,000
let me see oops i'm missing sorry john

1815
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,560
please go ahead john hanno yeah john

1816
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,960
that's right

1817
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,159
no see

1818
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,239
are you meeting

1819
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,080
you meet you can't hear you john you're

1820
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,480
unmute

1821
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:07,199
john you're on mute hi can you hear me

1822
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:07,920
now

1823
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,560
yes yes i can hear you yeah sorry for

1824
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,320
that um

1825
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,000
i haven't read that document so

1826
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,120
clarify that

1827
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,040
but in the presentation i got the

1828
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,440
feeling that you're steering both and

1829
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,679
three and and six

1830
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:23,440
somehow you know because that's what

1831
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,560
makes it optimal so i mean even that's

1832
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,960
fine but uh my question is more like if

1833
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,480
if that is the case

1834
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,880
um what happens to the functions and the

1835
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,920
upf like charging or other things

1836
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,000
charging of course but also other access

1837
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,239
control aspects like uh

1838
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:42,080
you know i i saw that it was first

1839
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,719
single dnn uh but if there are multiple

1840
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:47,280
dnn some slicing or other cures

1841
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:50,159
enforcements all of that

1842
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,840
those are questions but i'm making the

1843
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,840
assumption that you're steering both the

1844
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,920
n3 and then six so if you clarify that

1845
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,159
first

1846
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,400
thank you uh yes um uh in the sleepy

1847
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,040
point of view uh it will be uh

1848
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:08,159
uh yes or no but but um

1849
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:10,159
let's

1850
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:13,440
mention that the

1851
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,600
other

1852
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,040
functionality of the

1853
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,920
the processed in the upf um currently

1854
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,640
our architecture is just to prove uh

1855
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:25,520
fulfill the dmm requirement okay

1856
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,960
at the basement

1857
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,520
okay so i'm really happy to work

1858
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,960
to

1859
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,400
support other functionality if uh

1860
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,440
any people interested

1861
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,440
i was thinking more like you know it may

1862
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,440
be a private network or something like

1863
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,760
that so it's a single day and then

1864
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,679
you know factory or whatever you know

1865
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:46,560
something

1866
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,800
of that sort but um

1867
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,640
and then the questions are about access

1868
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,199
control and other things like that

1869
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:55,199
uh uh is that

1870
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:57,040
going to be

1871
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,440
in some other access controller should

1872
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,719
be

1873
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:02,960
controlled on the control plane on

1874
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,040
session management side

1875
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:09,360
the imp network mvp network uh just

1876
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,920
follow the uh the decision what's the

1877
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,320
decision made in the mobility management

1878
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,280
system okay mep

1879
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,920
mobile user plan doesn't have any uh

1880
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,440
intent

1881
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,520
because just to provide the

1882
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:28,640
dmm requirement satisfied okay i think

1883
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,400
and also this picture shows only one dna

1884
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,159
but multiple sides

1885
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:36,880
you mean one single dna but the multiple

1886
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:40,080
d and d9 okay

1887
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,440
thank you

1888
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,360
that's what i i try to explain okay

1889
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,839
thank you

1890
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:47,440
okay

1891
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,840
thank you john i know

1892
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,440
long time

1893
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,760
hello everybody yeah i i haven't read a

1894
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,199
comment not played this hero

1895
01:17:56,199 --> 01:17:59,120
heroes and i noticed that we haven't

1896
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,760
provided taylor's questions uh

1897
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,400
i have a question about this uh

1898
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,560
decision information

1899
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,040
what you are mentioning there on chapter

1900
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,360
six uh with

1901
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,239
where

1902
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:14,159
you are getting the session information

1903
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:17,280
from the control gateways and

1904
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:20,239
in that interface as i have understood

1905
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:22,960
also from the responsible what you have

1906
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,679
in in the mailing list that you are

1907
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:28,000
applying routing protocols

1908
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,239
irrespective which routing protocol it

1909
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:30,960
is

1910
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,440
but particularly if you consider the

1911
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,480
example pgp protocol i'm curious about

1912
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,840
them

1913
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,159
with the routing of be sufficiently

1914
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:41,679
reactive to

1915
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:44,400
sn carrying session information because

1916
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,280
that's

1917
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:48,320
that change that that's quite rapidly

1918
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,679
it's not like a prefix

1919
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,199
more of transaction type of information

1920
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:59,840
as we have seen from any alternative

1921
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,280
and the second

1922
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:04,719
question related this reactiveness

1923
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:08,159
consideration is the scalability

1924
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:10,080
do you think that this

1925
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,760
using single ears is scaling enough to

1926
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,840
the scale of

1927
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,000
mobile network or would you need to have

1928
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
multiple

1929
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,120
um

1930
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,920
i couldn't catch what exactly uh what

1931
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,120
the

1932
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,280
your question is

1933
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,280
let me clarify this one

1934
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:34,320
yeah okay

1935
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:37,799
let's fight

1936
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,600
the point is

1937
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,040
you know because you're adding

1938
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,239
individual routes what hanu is saying

1939
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:46,239
will you be able to scale because when

1940
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:48,480
you do steering at a session level

1941
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:51,280
you're almost almost like a in one sense

1942
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,760
it's like a host route right

1943
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,760
but this is steering but i think uh

1944
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,679
honest question is will the system scale

1945
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:00,880
i know did i get that right

1946
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:05,199
and then how fast you are reacting for

1947
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:06,960
propagating the

1948
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,840
routing pipeline

1949
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,080
okay thank you very much um

1950
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,920
i have the same question to the

1951
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,040
5g interface svi because they adopt the

1952
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,080
arrest

1953
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:21,440
and the um

1954
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,199
the post and the callback uh how time uh

1955
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:28,000
how react uh

1956
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:28,800
uh

1957
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,040
immediately but um

1958
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,480
the

1959
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:36,080
the we uh actually not uh defined the

1960
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,560
actual uh transport protocol for the

1961
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,560
northbound api and mit controller as

1962
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:41,840
well as the

1963
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,600
southbound with the controller now we

1964
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,360
adopt the

1965
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,239
pgp but not limited to

1966
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:51,120
but

1967
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:52,960
at least the pcp

1968
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,760
i have to admit the vp running of the

1969
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,140
tcp tcp has a

1970
01:20:58,140 --> 01:20:59,520
[Music]

1971
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,080
headphone bottleneck uh i have to admit

1972
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,280
but um

1973
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,920
the best as well

1974
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,600
and also the nowadays vcp carries the uh

1975
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,440
millions out

1976
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,400
of inside but outside of the

1977
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,159
network

1978
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:18,320
so that's the

1979
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,199
i have no idea how to compare the

1980
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:23,840
scalability which uh session based

1981
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,840
routing based scale scale or

1982
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,480
not that's my answer this time sorry i

1983
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,400
haven't uh

1984
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:35,040
uh exact on number of

1985
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,920
number two answer to you right now

1986
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:40,080
okay maybe that's something to consider

1987
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,880
later on thank you thank you thanks

1988
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,639
hello i think that's a that's a good

1989
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:46,960
comment

1990
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,760
chucky uh can you hear me

1991
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,760
sorry yeah yes

1992
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:54,880
okay

1993
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,639
okay uh i have some questions uh i

1994
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:01,199
i didn't uh spend the whole time

1995
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:04,000
watching your your video but i went

1996
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,239
through your slide and in a couple of

1997
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:07,840
them you mentioned about the nine

1998
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,199
interfaces in in the interface

1999
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:13,520
but without specific without expecting

2000
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,840
anything about like vrf or those type of

2001
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:16,719
things

2002
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:18,960
so how are you going to handle like you

2003
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,520
have more than one upf with a 9

2004
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,760
interfacing toy

2005
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,600
his first question

2006
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,120
and then depending on that i have

2007
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,679
another question

2008
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:30,800
okay um

2009
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,480
okay thank you very much

2010
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:33,520
to

2011
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:37,280
to focus on the one single question uh

2012
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,840
and

2013
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,600
if i

2014
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,400
understand your question correctly i

2015
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,280
think uh

2016
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,199
we don't need

2017
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:51,520
to deploy no9

2018
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,400
in the in the sr network

2019
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,040
because the uh this case just

2020
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:00,480
one upf exists so there's no link to a

2021
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,199
deployment line but

2022
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:04,239
if we

2023
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:07,839
see the same

2024
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:11,120
capability to provide two

2025
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,639
uh site of the one single dm

2026
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:18,400
we need two ups that's our assumption so

2027
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,560
then we put a nine in the middle of the

2028
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:24,239
path of the upf 2up

2029
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,679
okay did i cancel correctly for each

2030
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:29,760
question yes but in that case are you

2031
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,600
going to configure

2032
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:36,239
also config the vis on the ni interface

2033
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,199
this case you don't need to configure

2034
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:44,159
the n9 but if you follow this

2035
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:46,080
configuration

2036
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:48,159
you may need to uh configure internet

2037
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:49,840
involved

2038
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:50,800
okay

2039
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,560
yeah that's uh

2040
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,719
that's not our architecture

2041
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:56,639
okay sure no problem this seems like uh

2042
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,800
the for the follow-on question

2043
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,639
regarding uh something being discussed

2044
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:04,239
in 3gpp essay 2 about the multicast part

2045
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,920
probably you have heard there is like

2046
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,239
mbupf that'll be introduced

2047
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:10,800
and then on one side using a knight

2048
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,679
about the upf at the other side n6 about

2049
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:15,120
the edd

2050
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,360
and then because of some limitation or

2051
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,840
restriction on the genome b side and so

2052
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,679
there might be point point or point

2053
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:23,120
multipoint

2054
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,600
so for the mbupf it's going to have a

2055
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,320
knight about the upf and then it has it

2056
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,560
can provide another n3 directly

2057
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,480
throughout the genome

2058
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,880
so basically from the mbupf you're going

2059
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:37,199
to have two passes

2060
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:38,080
um

2061
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,199
yeah i

2062
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,880
don't know

2063
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:41,920
um

2064
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,760
how it's going to fit in this

2065
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,080
architecture at least i haven't seen it

2066
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,800
from your slides

2067
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,920
thank you very much um

2068
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,880
thank you very much but actually uh

2069
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,560
we didn't care the

2070
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,440
multicast service right now

2071
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:01,600
i think the mba service

2072
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,400
is

2073
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,520
the new

2074
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,800
service appeared recently in the cpp

2075
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,880
uh it's even it was already existing 4g

2076
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,560
but i will

2077
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,320
study

2078
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,199
uh for that service but

2079
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:18,480
currently

2080
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,679
we didn't

2081
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:23,360
see that service in our architecture

2082
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,719
i have to be i have to admit

2083
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:28,239
okay sure

2084
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:30,000
so dingy is that you're referring to the

2085
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,560
empms architecture

2086
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,440
uh it says a new that being introduced

2087
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:40,400
uh in sa2 it's a like a 5g mbs so i

2088
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:43,520
think the the the work i think the uh i

2089
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,760
think the phase two has been done it's

2090
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,360
uh it's almost there

2091
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,719
so yeah

2092
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:50,880
yeah

2093
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,920
phase three for the release 18 probably

2094
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,360
all that being

2095
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:56,800
been planning right now being planned

2096
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,080
right now

2097
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,120
okay

2098
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,719
that no that's a that's a good comment i

2099
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:03,040
think uh author should review that good

2100
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:05,600
thank you very much

2101
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
jeffrey

2102
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:13,920
yes i could actually offer a guess uh

2103
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,320
answer for the unknown question that

2104
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,320
from from png

2105
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,400
to me that's uh

2106
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:24,159
in iitf terms that n9 uh the box that

2107
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:25,679
does n9

2108
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:26,960
mapping there

2109
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,360
could be uh viewed as uh

2110
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:32,320
in doing inter as option b

2111
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,159
where you just do label switching or

2112
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:37,120
here is a non-label solution but sr

2113
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:40,000
b6 mapping and

2114
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,800
an end behavior that

2115
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,360
mashima-san has already specified in the

2116
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:46,880
other drafts we were talking about

2117
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:47,920
earlier

2118
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,880
just a guess

2119
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,280
you introduce option b between the the

2120
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:56,800
upf and some pe router

2121
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,400
interiors option b does not require vrs

2122
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:01,760
right

2123
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:04,880
okay okay all right

2124
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,520
thank you jeffrey any other questions

2125
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,920
comments

2126
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,000
all right uh if there are no other

2127
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,280
comments

2128
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,440
i'll leave this topic here thank you

2129
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,800
saturday son

2130
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:23,440
i think again working please review this

2131
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:26,639
document i think post your comments if

2132
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:29,199
there is interest you know we'll discuss

2133
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:30,800
on the next steps

2134
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,440
but right now there's an id individual

2135
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,679
contribution but uh with no working

2136
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:38,239
group status

2137
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:39,920
uh any other

2138
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,920
before we we are done with all our

2139
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,440
presentations

2140
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:46,320
again uh as we we talked about number of

2141
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,480
things action items on the individual

2142
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,320
ids

2143
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,000
uh from authors and also from the

2144
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,480
working group uh after this meeting we

2145
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,320
are going to send the notes

2146
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:59,280
that publish captured

2147
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,360
uh we'll take it from there

2148
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:04,000
any other final comments eric from your

2149
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,239
side

2150
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:08,960
comments feedback

2151
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,120
anything you'd like to see

2152
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,000
um

2153
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,560
assuming you met this eric um yeah if

2154
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,560
you're like yeah yeah uh the radical i

2155
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,000
don't bother him unless there is an

2156
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,239
idiot

2157
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:21,120
um

2158
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,280
nothing for me uh i think uh i'll need

2159
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,440
to absorb this presentation i'm trying

2160
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,719
to understand

2161
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:29,360
how it uh does not create an alternate

2162
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:31,760
architecture um although i understand

2163
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:32,800
that that's the argument that's trying

2164
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,880
to be made

2165
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:35,920
so

2166
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,760
but um

2167
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,760
thank you for for all of the

2168
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,080
all the work

2169
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,800
with that

2170
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,120
we close this session thank you so much
