1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,000
i don't see anything yet

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,320

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,599
nope

4
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,880
check your permissions

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,680
it's not the permissions i'm trying to

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,680
uh

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,800
to actually

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,280
i manage the slides

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,000
ah there we go

10
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,600
they just took some time to process

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,640
and they're out of order

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,078
that should show up now

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,960
all right well

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,680
we're short a chair but uh

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,719

guess we'll get started

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,119
yes another problem so uh i anticipated

21
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,720
hello everybody

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,240
uh

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,640
this is our ietf

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,000
112

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,960
joint ops area and ops area working

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,840
group

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,880
meeting and we have some logistics

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,439
prepared for all of you uh just there's

29
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,479
a red

30
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,680
text here that tells you everything you

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,240
say and post and

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,200
utter here is being recorded

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,280
i hope you're okay with that

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,720
so if not well non-participation i think

35
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,240
is the only option next slide please

36
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,600
so we have the note well

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,240
i think this is rather well known if

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,880
you're not familiar with this

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,280
everything you say here

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,000
is agreed upon about the iitf process

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,360
and policies

42
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,200
uh please be aware that if you are

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,200
uttering anything that is about uh ipr

44
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,280
and and and some other controlled

45
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,040
content and ip here uh be aware that

46
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,280
that uh disclosing this here might

47
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,160
create a conflict so take care of that

48
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,879
uh we will record everything like the

49
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,080
chat and and uh the uh own or something

50
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,239
is happening here on my side the chat

51
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,800
and um

52
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,160
uh the

53
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,400
participants and everything and there's

54
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,920
a lot of links at the bottom of this

55
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,480
page now so especially i would like to

56
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,840
point out bcp 25 which is basically be

57
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,360
nice to each other which is also

58
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,640
complemented by bcp 54

59
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,080
how we should actually conduct that uh

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,879
next slide please

61
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,239
so this is the in addition uh recently

62
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,080
so uh um

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,599
my assumption is um some

64
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,920
discussions in the past three months

65
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,920
haven't been as polite as they could

66
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,519
have been

67
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,720
so uh

68
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,760
so i think we are striving towards a

69
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,360
constructive uh discussion and i think

70
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,239
that we all expect each other to behave

71
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,480
accordingly uh so there are some

72
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,640
professional standards here and i think

73
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,519
um i'm just stating the very obvious and

74
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,599
i haven't seen anything here that is uh

75
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,799
um

76
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,200
the question about that but uh this is

77
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,840
an addition to our our notes here right

78
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,799
today and please be aware of that

79
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,799
again and there's a copyright and the

80
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,000
patents guidance as a best practice if

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,080
you're not really sure how that works

82
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,599
please look that up

83
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,159
next time please

84
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,400
so uh uh yeah as this is uh all our

85
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,799
online meeting we are really hoping to

86
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,599
get back to the face-to-face and the i

87
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,159
don't know uh screaming in their faces

88
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,280
like uh at hand uh at the moment this is

89
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,120
not possible is there so we have a

90
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,279
jabber room um if you're if you're

91
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,798
familiar with java please make use of

92
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,279
that there's a participation guide how

93
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,120
to use the meat echo if you're not

94
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
familiar with that but apparently you're

95
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,600
here so until now i guess you've crossed

96
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,759
that threshold already if you're

97
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,600
experiencing problems with that there's

98
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
another link i think that's more

99
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,199
important that's about issues if you

100
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,960
find something really annoying here

101
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,080
please uh

102
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,800
raise an issue on this uh

103
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,560
link below here at the bottom of the

104
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,040
slides and otherwise when you're not

105
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,919
speaking uh that might be obvious uh try

106
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,960
to mute uh video i think is not a big of

107
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,600
a problem but if you don't want to be

108
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,199
in the center of the attention also

109
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,440
turn off your video because all of this

110
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,280
is recorded next slide please

111
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,800
yeah now it's us

112
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
our tyrann joined us so we have three

113
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,880
chairs here in the uh up say uh wg and

114
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,639
uh um we have uh i think prepared people

115
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,360
to take uh individuals to take minutes

116
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,919
and to read the java scribe so this is a

117
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,880
call to the group now

118
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,840
are there any designated minutes taker

119
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,520
for today

120
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,880
elliott

121
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,440
said he would do it i see him on and i

122
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,080
see things being typed into the the

123
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,759
notes so i guess

124
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,400
the answer is yes

125
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,039
excellent yes i prepared a skeleton uh

126
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,919
minutes so so insert something here is

127
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:46,720
my

128
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,360
my fault so i guess it's a small kind of

129
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,360
guidance um

130
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,039
yeah if anybody wants to follow this

131
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,840
meeting on the note side please uh

132
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
follow the notes link here in the the

133
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,080
slide deck it's also on the data tracker

134
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,400
of course and you're with us in the mid

135
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,440
echo so that's apparently clear uh next

136
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,840
slide please

137
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,280
okay so now in the past four months we

138
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,840
made uh yeah there was progress and this

139
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,560
is a busy group as uh most of you are

140
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,600
aware so we published a new rfc which is

141
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,039
uh 9105. i'm really happy to see tacx

142
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,080
plus

143
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,919
being something you can now read and

144
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,240
rely on thank you for

145
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,319
guiding that through the gateway

146
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,440
function that is isu and r48 i think

147
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,919
that took a while and congratulations to

148
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,800
authors and editors here so

149
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,199
on the other hand here we have something

150
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,280
that is already an irc editor q i think

151
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,759
uh that that's just uh now let's work

152
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,479
anymore so so your thumbs pressed that

153
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,039
there's nothing uh that is a threshold

154
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:55,840
there

155
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,639
we have something recently being moved

156
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,520
to uh isu publications

157
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,400
which the

158
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,680
telemetry id i'm hoping to see progress

159
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,000
there and but i'm not really concerned

160
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,039
and i can i'm happy to announce that i

161

takes a while to review

171
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,039
um

172
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,479
uh and i'm pleased the editor is working

173
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,599
with uh tom fetch also addressing some

174
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,000
comments as they go along so i i'm

175
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,879
hoping to complete my review of this by

176
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,960
the end of itf week

177
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,120
provided that the itf meeting is

178
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,840
suitably boring

179
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,919
which is

180
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,879
um i'm not commenting on this

181
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,720
so probably but uh yeah i i'm i don't

182
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,639
see any hard blockers there thank you

183
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,360
adrian for um taking your thorough time

184
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,479
for this as a shepherd i know that

185
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,520
not from the text box and

186
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,080
from mad the vpn the vpn common model is

187
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,719
also in the rfcq

188
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,720
is it though okay so that might be a

189
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,719
error on my part because i didn't see

190
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,679
the

191
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,080
editor queue for vpn in the track card

192
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,039
to be honest but okay

193
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,399
then we have two options for this so

194
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,799
thank you for uh adding that taran

195
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,200
and um so so where we are so this is a

196
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,680
busy pipeline as you can see uh we have

197
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,760
multiple stages all of them are

198
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,399
populated and utilized

199
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,959
and we recently uh

200
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,000
adopted two other ids

201
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,640
uh upon the licensing

202
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,800
content and about the

203
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,279
historical content that is pcapp and we

204
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,560
will have

205
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,519
um

206
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,080
specific time slots assigned to that uh

207
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,320
looking at the time i really have to go

208
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,160
far faster here

209
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,279
please go to the next line

210
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,440
so these are just agenda items so pretty

211
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,399
much you can see this is a recap of the

212
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,160
what we're doing here today we have uh

213
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,920
we're going with administrative first

214
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,000
this is like one minute left for me

215
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,320
basically and uh then we go through the

216
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,880
adopted items next slide please

217
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,080
again a lot of more adopted items and i

218
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,160
am not sure how elliot is going to do

219
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,200
this in two minutes but uh sure let's

220
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,480
try that out and then the next slides we

221
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,519
have the related work um there's also a

222
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,839
lot of packed agenda here the agenda

223
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,519
really had to be uh let's call it uh

224
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,120
orchestrated um there was a lot of

225
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,040
demand for time and i think it's it's

226
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,920
great to see all of this contributions

227
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,519
but we really have to make sure that

228
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,040
time next time please um is is taking

229
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,959
care of so as you can see we might uh

230
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,160
interrupt

231
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,760
uh when you are taking too long and

232
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,560
typically we we we'd like to have a good

233
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,160
discussion here but today i guess we

234
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,880
have to be more strict than usual so

235
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,160
sorry for that

236
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,480
in advance but sometimes we will just

237
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,160
interject and say

238
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,880
next presentation please so uh

239
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,760
there's in the end a a a ephemeral

240
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,560
number of minutes for warren rob to talk

241
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,839
about the uh office area agenda i think

242
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,399
they might uh um compress that a little

243
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,600
bit uh so uh do we have uh so we can

244
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,680
have an open mic in the end and wrong

245
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,360
yes so so the uh um just real quick um

246
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,320
the the ads have said that if they need

247
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,240
the time if anyone has something and

248
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,320
we'll remind you an hour into this if

249
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,399
anyone has something just put it in the

250
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,399
chat and we'll make sure there's time to

251
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,800
discuss that if not we can use some of

252
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,880
that 10 minutes to um

253
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,959
as buffer as needed

254
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,120
um that's that's what we we kind of

255
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,000
agreed to ahead of time

256
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,800
yeah cool exactly so so if you have

257
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,600
something uh addressing to the uh ops

258
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,519
area directly which is the joint meeting

259
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,079
of course but the joint means a little

260
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,440
bit lopsided thing to the upside wg

261
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,560
today so with no other words from my

262
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,959
side let's go to the first presentation

263
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,399
here and

264
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,920
i guess it's

265
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
take it away

266
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,200
very good can you hear me yeah

267
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,240
excellent

268
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,079
so let me give an update on those two

269
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,320
drafts that are serious assurance for

270
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
intent based networking both

271
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,800
architecture and young module on behalf

272
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,199
of

273
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,600
dan tangam

274
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,959
paolo

275
00:11:58,959 --> 00:11:59,920
uh

276
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,519
paolo

277
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,600
so next slide please

278
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,279
in a one slide

279
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,320
summary

280
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,480
what we want to do is when a service

281
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,800
degrades where is the fault and what are

282
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,959
the symptoms and we want to discover the

283
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,880
root cause but also the reverse

284
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,600
direction when a network component fails

285
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,320
which services are impacted

286
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,800
so let me go to the next slide

287
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,360
in order to buy you some time

288
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,600
this is a picture of a prototype that

289
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,160
was done some time ago

290
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,880
on this assurance graph let me tell you

291
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,440
that with the second prototype of this

292
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,360
now

293
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,720
so okay enough for the intro next slide

294
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,680
something that we added in version two

295
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,240
of the architecture draft is that we

296
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,639
made it clear that we have a dag

297
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,720
directed as a graph

298
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,560
by adding arrows to to the edges there

299
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,600
so

300
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,959
i think this is clear now

301
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,959
on the next slide

302
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,920
we received the the feedback and the

303
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,399
right feedback actually from elliot and

304
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,240
and and kiriti

305
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,959
telling that in some situation you might

306
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,800
have some circular

307
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
references circular dependencies into

308
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,639
your graph the example that was

309
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,200
mentioned was like okay specifically in

310
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,959
case of cloud

311
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,440
native cloud native applications right

312
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,680
so you might have containers and vm they

313
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,040
might depend on dhcp or dns

314
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,519
so we we thought about uh

315
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,600
thinking we thought about having a

316
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,639
simpler example so typically an engineer

317
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,519
a

318
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,839
is defining interface depends on the

319
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:44,959
link

320
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,560
but an engineer b is defining the link

321
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,800
depends on the interface whenever we

322
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,880
need to merge those two

323
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,199
smaller assurance graph well we will

324
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,880
have an issue there or circular

325
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,959
dependency

326
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,360
and that that's a problem so first thing

327
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,040
is that iliad

328
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,959
and kiriti were right it could happen

329
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,600
the the second thing is that they should

330
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,320
be avoided right and

331
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,399
the orchestrator

332
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,880
could and should detect those circular

333
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,399
dependencies

334
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,399
so we added an entire new section on

335
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,079
that concept

336
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,320
and on the next slide we propose a graph

337
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,560
transformation proposal

338
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,279
where if you see on the left hand side

339
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,000
the c d e and f

340
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,240
is what's called a strongly connected

341
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,480
component

342
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,760
and

343
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,720
we could rearrange the graph

344
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,160
by having like an extra top

345
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,240
service here

346
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,600
and uh

347
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,320
d e c d e f will depend on the top so

348
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,279
from

349
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,440
a point of view so from the top of the

350
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,279
graph we would have the same set of

351
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,360
dependencies

352
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,440
and the same node

353
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,800
for

354
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,480
c d e and f

355
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,639
so this is not part of a standard this

356
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,199
is a proposal to mention that whenever

357
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,360
the orchestrator detects

358
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,839
the circular circular dependencies he

359
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,000
should not allow that and there is a way

360
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
to uh

361
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
to to uh

362
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,240
to change the graph to accommodate the

363
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,199
problem

364
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,000
on the next slide

365
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,040
the yang module was untouched

366
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,759
we discovered an issue in the previous

367
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,519
itf but

368
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,920
based on the prototype no more issues

369
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,920
this is completely unchanged

370
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,839
so what's left to be done in the next

371
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,600
slide

372
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,480
the

373
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,959
one open issue we have in mind is to

374
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,639
align the

375
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,160
the technology was the two nmrg draft

376
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,399
specifically the one about the concept

377
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,079
and definition of intent based

378
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,519
networking

379
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,360
those drafts are finalized

380
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,600
now

381
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,519
so we were good on that front so there's

382
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,120
something we're going to do

383
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,920
and i see a lot is in the in the line

384
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,720
let me go for the last slide and then uh

385
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,279
get elliot's feedback

386
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,079
so i'm sure that you guys the chairs are

387
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,600
going to ask right but what is the

388
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,759
situation next steps so

389
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,160
first points let me report on the

390
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,880
non-results of the non-hackathon meeting

391
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,639
that we were not having

392
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,079
but we were

393
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,360
thinking about having

394
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,399
a hackathon about the how to combine the

395
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,279
house of different subservices and how

396
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,079
to compute the status of the service

397
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,720
so typically whenever we got like an

398
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,440
mbls vpn it could be hub and spoke or it

399
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,279
could be fully meshed

400
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,079
so what do you report as a

401
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,639
combined health in those two different

402
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,920
scenarios

403
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,160
well it's not that obvious basically the

404
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,640
answer is it depends so

405
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,520
i'm stressing this because we we still

406
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,199
believe it's something important that we

407
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,799
want to do and it might be part of the

408
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,959
next hackathon

409
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,760
the next thing is that it's great to

410
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,400
think about okay i report a symptom

411
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,520
okay like the interface is flapping

412
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,079
right but if we're sending yet another

413
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,880
type of syslog message with plain

414
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,400
english text

415
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,880
we're not going to solve the issue of

416
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,880
closed loop automation because we're

417
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,799
back to square one we need to do a

418
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,720
graphing slot message

419
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,960
now i'm not sure if those two would be

420
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,120
part of the same draft or a different

421
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,360
one or even solidized

422
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,200
but these are things that we

423
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,039
that we're thinking of

424
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,559
now to answer the question that the

425
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,720
chairs might be asking

426
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,000
okay so uh what is the status i believe

427
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,799
that by the next ietf if no more issues

428
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,640
are discovered it would be time to last

429
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,840
call those two drafts

430
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,440
and

431
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,919
i'm done so

432
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,120
eight more minutes to go

433
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,760
any questions or feedback i see one from

434
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,000
from elliot

435
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,600
thanks thanks very much benoit uh

436
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,440
i think the strap remains incredibly

437
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,880
important um actually

438
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,240
really incredibly so i just i can't i

439
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
can't emphasize it enough um thanks for

440
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,120
the changes um just in terms of the

441
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,679
graph transformations i think one of the

442
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,720
things that would be very useful would

443
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,960
i'm not sure if the draft has it yet

444
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,640
would be to show what those

445
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,000
transformations mean operationally um

446
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,919
in terms of giving maybe an example or

447
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,200
two and

448
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,440
um we talked about dns maybe maybe

449
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,280
follow through with the dns example as

450
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,760
to what that means

451
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,720
um

452
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,600
search for you said very good we could

453
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,440
do that i

454
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,280
maybe i need to have a brief call with

455
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,080
you because hopefully information will

456
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,559
not mean anything from an operational

457
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,840
point of view

458
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,640
except maybe in the mind of the engineer

459
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,840
a and b

460
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,320
that in the future might have to design

461
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,120
their their graph differently but can we

462
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,799
have a five minutes discussion and to

463
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,400
make sure i get your point and get the

464
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,039
the right text in there

465
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,280
yeah that's just a just to make i'll be

466
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,919
really clear right the graph represents

467
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,400
where the services are situated and so

468
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,480
if you reorganize the graph you're

469
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,600
reorganizing where those services reside

470
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,400
and so all i'm saying is um and we can

471
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,919
follow through on an example as to what

472
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,280
that means and i'm happy to have a call

473
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,919
with you always

474
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,280
okay perfect

475
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
so where the grad representative service

476
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,720
resides

477
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,080
not in all

478
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,520
situations

479
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,080
it also shows the dependencies for

480
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,240
successful service

481
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,679
so you know if you say i need to have

482
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,000
connectivity between a and b and c and d

483
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,240
etc just

484
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
organizing this

485
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,400
those dependencies will still give you

486
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,559
the same requirements

487
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,960
but let's discuss it i want to make sure

488
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,000
i catch your point completely

489
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,679
okay thank you

490
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,919
thank you

491
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,600
i had a maybe a related question as a as

492
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,039
a just an individual contributor um on

493
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:29,919
your

494
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,559
level of indirection as michael put it

495
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,960
how is that programmatically determined

496
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,720
how do you decide

497
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,600
what needs to be inserted is that

498
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,960
top level

499
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,080
service to remove the

500
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,840
to remove the loop or remove the

501
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,120
circular dependency

502
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,120
and if you're talking benoit looks like

503
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
you are you're muted i can't hear you at

504
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,440
least right so sorry my bad so if you go

505
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,880
back a couple of cases a couple of

506
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,440
slides back you're asking how do i know

507
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,240
that i need to introduce this top

508
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,200
sub service here which is how do you

509
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,320
how do you know and and how what is it

510
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,600
how do you like what

511
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
what do you

512
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,640
yeah

513
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,760
concretely what is it

514
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,520
very good so uh

515
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,080
let me let me add some more text to it

516
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,520
uh

517
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,600
now this is just a proposal on how to

518
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,919
solve it but i agree with you uh what i

519
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,159
call an empty shelf in there should be

520
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,400
more specified

521
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,480
i'll take that nighttime to solve this

522
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,520
one

523
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,840
thanks

524
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,480
yeah this is saying uh as a contributor

525
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,080
also um this is a composite service

526
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,280
problem right

527
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,640
so uh uh identification of uh

528
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,840
subservices and and composition

529
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,159
of sub-services seems to be uh

530
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,120
of

531
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,600
essentially here so so that is something

532
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,559
that should be uh uh transparent around

533
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,440
uh all the consumers of this information

534
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,320
and you're going to do telemetry and and

535
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,559
and i think it's very important to have

536
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,720
a uh believable

537
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,559
and and and sustainable trustworthy

538
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,039
assertion about what these services are

539
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,720
and how they are composed but that might

540
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,600
be a a orthogonal problem but maybe

541
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,240
maybe think about that

542
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,880
okay i will let's not forget we made

543
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,240
this framework

544
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,960
open so that let's see multiple

545
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,320
controllers

546
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,360
with multiple part of the graphs

547
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,600
then they could just combine these

548
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,080
and if all of them depends on you know

549
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,600
dns or dhcp this is the same one

550
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,840
so it's actually a feature that you

551
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,720
could combine graph from different

552
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,000
sources

553
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,840
and i understand what you meant thank

554
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,000
you

555
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,240
and uh elliot you are still in the line

556
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,600
uh are you there deliberately

557
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,960
okay robert

558
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,440
sorry rob sorry

559
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,919
this is as a contributor

560
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,080
i guess i'm speaking it's just one i

561
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,520
haven't read the latest version of draft

562
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,520
benoit but i've noticed in terms of

563
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,840
removing the circuit dependencies rather

564
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,400
than forcing the graph to change did you

565
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,280
consider the option of just having some

566
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,159
uh rules effectively to break that the

567
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,799
circular chain

568
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,400
so rather than changing the graph you

569
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,960
could put in some or some annotation to

570
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,720
say at this point i want to break that

571
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
chain but keep the graph the same but

572
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,080
does that not make sense what you're

573
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,640
trying to do

574
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,240
right so

575
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,000
that's something that we couldn't

576
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,919
enforce telling you shall not

577
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,760
add the dependency

578
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,200
regular dependencies and engineer a or b

579
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,480
or whoever

580
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,640
just behave we could always do that

581
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,600
right so the first thing is to detect it

582
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,440
to see if in practice we've got many of

583
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,000
those currencies right if we go back to

584
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,880
the uh the previous slide uh it might be

585
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,039
just a question of educating engineer a

586
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,080
and b

587
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,159
so that they design

588
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,159
their their theirs their part of the

589
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,480
service they're the same way

590
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,440
so yes we could have rules this could be

591
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,679
in the draft this could be you know you

592
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,159
shall not accept regular dependencies

593
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,039
uh sure

594
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,760
so my suggestion was actually slightly

595
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,000
different was maybe

596
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,600
and again i haven't looked at it maybe

597
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,960
you want to allow the circular

598
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,440
dependencies but put a mitigation in the

599
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,120
processing so that they're not an issue

600
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,279
to have some other way to say actually

601
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,880
at this point if you get to a circular

602
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,799
dependency with the the changes the

603
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,640
events have been propagated you then

604
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,400
break the chain at this point or

605
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,159
something like that

606
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,520
i was wondering you considered that

607
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
rather than forcing the dependency not

608
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,400
to be there it's just a thought

609
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,240
okay thank you i'll

610
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,279
i'll see what i could do in a draft

611
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,360
um some of these things been while now

612
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,919
back as a chair might be uh useful to

613
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,480
bring to the list to because in your

614
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,600
your um

615
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,440
next steps you you want to bring it to

616
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,600
last call some of these would be good

617
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,760
extra discussion items

618
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,679
to to get

619
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,559
more people thinking and talking about

620
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,760
the sane architecture

621
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,360
that makes sense sure

622
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,159
okay then we got one minute uh left here

623
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,880
so we can move on to the next item if

624
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,240
there are no other

625
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,799
comments or questions

626
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,600
excellent

627
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,559
i see the deck is being shared

628
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,760
uh

629
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,400
maybe it got a little

630
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,159
a little out of order ah i see it

631
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,840
there we go

632
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,039
perfect michael uh

633
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,120
now it's your turn

634
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,840
and i get my my timer reset i really

635
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,559
like the timer it's really nice okay uh

636
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,320
so i'm here to talk about uh final

637
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,039
throws of this document on mud and iot

638
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,120
and dns uh we talked about it last time

639
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,440
at ietf 111 as well

640
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,039
i'm just going to mention that that very

641
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,880
briefly there is a different document on

642
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,600
acceptable urls and my belief is that

643
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,840
it's completely ready to go forward and

644
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,679
i think the chairs agreed and that's why

645
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,760
there's no presentation on it today next

646
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,400
slide please

647
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
um next slide please i just said that no

648
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,840
real change from one one one

649
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,159
okay um and we had a conversation and i

650
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,919
went actually back to watch the video to

651
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,240
remember what happened and i tried to to

652
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,960
reengage uh a thread on the working

653
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,400
group about this

654
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,600
um

655
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,559
and so my take is that from the feedback

656
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,880
is that we just need to not do this that

657
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,679
that the biggest problem here is iot

658
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,080
devices that do dns requests that may

659
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,240
not that may receive

660
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,480
geographically specific answers that may

661
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,000
not be the same answer that the mud

662
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
controller gets and therefore the access

663
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,840
control lists would not be set up by

664
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,919
niem uh correctly

665
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,480
um so when we discussed this last time

666
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,159
elliott came to the mic and said he

667
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,840
thought that it was solvable

668
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,960
um i'm

669
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,559
i'm not sure uh that that's the case um

670
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,559
i'd like to have more of a conversation

671
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,360
uh on the list to figure out whether we

672
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,520
can say anything at all other than uh

673
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,720
don't do that

674
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,039
um and that's really the only open issue

675
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,520
i did open it finally as an issue uh on

676
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,279
the in the github

677
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,640
um

678
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,159
and uh

679
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,679
next slide i think that's the last

680
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,919
that's it

681
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,760
so i would i would really love to have a

682
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,120
little bit more conversation in our

683
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
three minutes here as to what's actually

684
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,000
uh

685
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
whether we can say anything in the end

686
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,039
um

687
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,960
and the the

688
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,279
the major thing that i want to emphasize

689
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,440
is that while there might be mud

690
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,720
environments

691
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,080
and mud controllers that are very

692
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,320
sophisticated that have integrated dns

693
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,880
controllers and this kind of stuff

694
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,720
where it's possible

695
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,279
the question is for a manufacturer is

696
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,039
can he rely on that

697
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,640
and i think that's the conversation that

698
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,360
we need to have is is what what what was

699
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,000
there go ahead elliot

700
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,440
i'm not sure how strongly we're

701
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,360
disagreeing but i think it's worth

702
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,120
elaborating that just a bit into the

703
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,480
draft and then um you know i think as we

704
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,480
do it will kink out

705
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,640
the the sort of issues that you and i

706
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,720
were discussing and i'm happy to i don't

707
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,240
want to engage in it directly here but

708
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,200
i'm happy to to do that on the list

709
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,600
okay so there is a message where i about

710
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,279
three or four weeks ago where i tried to

711
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,120
bring that up again

712
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,279
and i'll reply again to that message and

713
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,960
maybe we can have a bit of a larger

714
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,799
conversation about what kind of text you

715
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,039
think we can put in because i think this

716
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,480
is essentially

717
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,279
um a question of

718
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,080
uh

719
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,360
if you do this then this is the

720
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,880
consequences i think that's what we have

721
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,039
to write down perhaps in the draft

722
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,799
um and

723
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,240
the question is to whether we want to

724
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,520
make normative

725
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,279
uh um

726
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,120
normative changes to the mud controller

727
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,120
in this draft is i think

728
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,520
uh an open question and i'm happy to do

729
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,840
that but i'm just not sure that

730
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,840
it's meaningful at this point uh to do

731
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,440
that

732
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,840
anyone else want to make a comment

733
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,240
no okay so i'm next as well so uh you

734
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,440
want to bring up the next set of slides

735
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,840
changing that to the uh uh

736
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,760
p-cap

737
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,320
presentation thank you michael there we

738
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,520
go all right now you'll know it's a

739
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,799
different presenter because i have a

740
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,120
different hat

741
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,840
there we go

742
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,039
um and uh matches my shirt today um okay

743
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,039
so we went through uh working next slide

744
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,279
please

745
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,480
uh we went through an adoption call in

746
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,159
october for these

747
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,240
uh documents there's two documents one

748
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,559
is pcapp one is pcapng

749
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,720
i'm a little bit confused as to which

750
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,520
one was adopted and which one was not

751
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,320
i

752
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,559
think it's really a document set i'm not

753
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,880
sure you can adopt one without the other

754
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,559
um

755
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,279
or it makes sense um and that's really

756
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,960
what this co this presentation is

757
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,360
conversation is about uh we had a

758
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,200
proposal in the thread about the

759
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,559
conversation about having a third

760
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,760
document

761
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,679
which would just create the link type

762
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,039
registry

763
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,559
um and to do that in a in some new

764
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,320
document um

765
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,440
so i guess i don't have a strong

766
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,519
objection to that um

767
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,679
there's about 280

768
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,880
existing uh link types registered and

769
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,960
they need to go into the iana registry

770
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,000
somehow

771
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,120
um

772
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,360
one

773
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,039
there's many different ways we could do

774
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,080
this

775
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,000
i believe that the document creates the

776
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,640
registry uh should initialize it

777
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,600
um and had a conversation some months

778
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,840
ago with ayanna about how they would

779
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,159
like to ideally receive them and they

780
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,159
said they'd be happy to have xml

781
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,360
attached and uh it it's pretty much

782
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,960
pretty much we could do that easily to

783
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,880
make their life easier

784
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,200
um if you did have a third document that

785
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,720
did this and that would remove the

786
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,559
requirement that the pcap document go

787
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,720
through a ietf process because the

788
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,840
registry we want to create

789
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,399
needs to be created by an ietf document

790
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,480
it cannot be created by an independent

791
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,120
submission stream document

792
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,600
if you remove that then the historical

793
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,519
pcap could go via ise or could go via 80

794
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,640
sponsor

795
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,679
um

796
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:04,559
i

797
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,640
i don't particularly think it's easier

798
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,960
harder for any other particular way at

799
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,080
least from my point of view it's not um

800
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,880
but the the goal really is that pk pcap

801
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,279
ng would be on standards track uh for

802
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,399
that um and if the working group decided

803
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,240
that pcapp should go directly to

804
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,399
historical actually i think that would

805
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,559
represent the reality okay is that it's

806
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,360
out there it's happened it's just uh not

807
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,200
there next slide please and hank go

808
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,960
ahead

809
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,120
yeah so what i think what we just uh

810
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,880
agreed upon in the working group and

811
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,559
this is saying as a chair

812
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,960
um is that yeah pcapp should be uh uh

813
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,360
polished and go direct into historical i

814
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,200
think that is the plan

815
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,519
and and sometimes the messages though

816
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,399
don't convey that message very well but

817
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,200
uh i think that was its initial goal i

818
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,880
think that is what we're targeting here

819
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,640
for from uh

820
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,720
jazz point of view um i i uh tentatively

821
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,039
agree with the notion that p cap ng

822
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,279
is kind of attached to that

823
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,760
but uh that's a different kind of work

824
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,399
so uh um i think uh the only problem

825
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,360
here was a procedure one uh that uh

826
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,120
people who were discussing this a year

827
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,320
ago

828
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,080
did not raise their voice uh in the

829
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,760
adoption call

830
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,840
so i think that's a logistical problem

831
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,600
not a intentional problem so i assume

832
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,080
optimistically that that there is

833
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,720
actually enough support but when we do

834
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,399
the procedures

835
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,159
i think people have to follow the

836
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,880
procedure so uh that's i think the only

837
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,720
reason why this did not cross the

838
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,600
threshold yet and uh and we can we can

839
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,880
reconciliate that here by by by by

840
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,279
highlighting yeah if you really want to

841
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,799
do the the uh um future work that might

842
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,760
be annoying

843
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,320
even for c or anything like that yeah

844
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,720
just voice your opinion and then then

845
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,960
we're good but that did not happen on

846
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,080
the list and unfortunately

847
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,280
procedure-wise that is not enough

848
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,320
elliot asks in the chat why not put the

849
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,760
link type registry into pcapng

850
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,639
and that's certainly possible um it does

851
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,639
mean that the pcap document would

852
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,079
reference it

853
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,760
um and

854
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,960
uh

855
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,359
uh that's fine there it's unlikely that

856
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,719
they're going to proceed through the rfc

857
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,960
editor queue uh separately

858
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,079
um

859
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,679
so i don't have a problem with doing

860
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,918
that um if that's what the working group

861
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,719
would prefer um i think that a third

862
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,119
document for third document's sake is

863
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,879
you know it's a good it's a good cs

864
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,639
layer of indirection to do but i think

865
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,918
it's a bad

866
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,639
optimizing uh

867
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,199
ietf resources point of view to do

868
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,359
so if if you want to put link cap link

869
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,440
type it into pcapng

870
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,359
uh we can do that that's okay

871
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,839
yeah this option should be simply put on

872
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,160
the list and i think there's not a big

873
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,640
uh con this is not a contentious topic

874
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,720
it just is a topic of uh what what

875
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,200
what's what's the what's the solution on

876
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,440
on where to go it's like two options

877
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,839
maybe do the pizza upon this question to

878
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:20,240
the list and then we go from there

879
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,440
okay wonderful thank you very much

880
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,040
yeah moving on

881
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,200
i hope that beau is on the

882
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
on the queue or

883
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,439
jin

884
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,720
can you hear me

885
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,720
yeah that works oh oh that's good

886
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,920
uh thanks uh hello everyone uh

887
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,920
this is paul and i'm going to present

888
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,440
uh the updates on this uh network and

889
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,440
vpn service performance monitoring draft

890
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,079
slide please

891
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,720
uh

892
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,640
here is some quick

893
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,079
summary of the status of this draft

894
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,000
since last ietf meeting we haven't

895
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,400
updated this draft

896
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,920
since we

897
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,720
the most the authors

898
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,839
are also the authors their three in them

899
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,720
and they're two of them and

900
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,640
they are very

901
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,839
occupied by these two drafts uh working

902
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,839
group last call

903
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,280
and and this draft is uh

904
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,599
the purpose of this draft is to uh

905
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,160
compliments uh layer three and then m

906
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,400
and two and they're two of them and

907
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,160
uh after

908
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,359
uh

909
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,640
in a figure uh we show that this

910
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,680
uh this model is to used

911
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,079
uh together with their three in them and

912
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,520
they're two of them

913
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,119
after provisioning using that two models

914
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,640
uh this model

915
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,800
can use to collect

916
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,200
status of this vpn uh performance

917
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,720
monitoring

918
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,119
and then exposed to the service

919
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,599
orchestration and the modeling approach

920
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,680
of this draft

921
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,640
uh is to augment uh ietf network and

922
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,320
topology model

923
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,800
uh in in this case the

924
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,599
the the network and vpn performance

925
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,839
monitoring can be associated and to uh

926
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:48,880
and then

927
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,839
that helps the

928
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:52,960
the two

929
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,320
uh understand

930
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,440
why the uh vpn performance monitor

931
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,320
better related with uh vpn uh with the

932
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,040
network um

933
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,640
uh status

934
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,400
so here we

935
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,880
right now we uh in the github we only

936
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,040
have one open issue and uh that's uh

937
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,680
the next uh please go into the next one

938
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,839
then i'm talking about this open issue

939
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,560
uh yes

940
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,440
this issue is uh

941
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,480
is from last ietf meeting

942
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,599
and joe made the comments on uh

943
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,520
why we uh

944
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,359
defined the performance monitoring

945
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,200
source to use a string other than

946
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,800
uh other type

947
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,040
it proposed to use identity type so we

948
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,240
after investigation we think uh

949
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,800
and also at that time

950
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,079
there is some other

951
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,599
suggestion to use some list

952
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,280
as the this performance monitor saw so

953
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,520
uh

954
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,240
the authors

955
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,960
had some discussion and they proposed to

956
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,640
use identity

957
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,200
to define the different performance

958
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,720
monitoring uh

959
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,440
approaches that uh the the controller

960
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,520
can use to collect the

961
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,599
performance metrics

962
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,119
so uh

963
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,119
here in the draft

964
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,280
we mentioned we could use bgpls

965
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,000
or some other om

966
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,680
methods to

967
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,520
get this uh

968
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,359
monitor information

969
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,280
and so

970
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,560
we propose to use identity to

971
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,880
to define this type

972
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,920
and next step please

973
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,200
so

974
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,640
so in uh we propose to use uh identity

975
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,680
to define this pm source tab

976
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,839
we define a base

977
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:10,000
uh type then we uh use uh like we define

978
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,960
some

979
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,200
typical

980
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,720
method to

981
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,680
to get this metrics like uh pgpls t-vamp

982
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,839
and uh what dot

983
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:26,079
1731 like uh each for the

984
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,040
layer three uh vpn the two-way pin and

985
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,160
also from the network like bgpls is from

986
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,720
to collect to collect network

987
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,839
uh performance

988
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:38,400
matrix

989
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,680
so

990
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,480
next slide please

991
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,480
oh

992
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,920
it seems i can uh yes this one uh

993
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,119
there's a

994
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,079
discussion uh with the the authors the

995
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,640
authors uh thought that

996
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,680
under uh right now the term uh network

997
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,760
only shows the

998
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,079
termination point uh performance

999
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,839
statistics

1000
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,359
but

1001
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,920
we should also add some vpn

1002
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,839
network access although uh specific

1003
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,359
counters to

1004
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,599
to see uh what's the difference with

1005
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,319
these two uh like uh

1006
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,400
to know

1007
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,599
like

1008
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,599
uh how the termination

1009
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,480
metrics and how the

1010
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,359
per vp network access uh statistics so

1011
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,160
we

1012
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,200
propose to add a vpn access

1013
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,359
statistic list

1014
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:51,599
so i show here uh some new notes we are

1015
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,160
proposing to add

1016
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,119
in in this way we will add some

1017
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,800
specific

1018
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,119
statistics

1019
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,000
and in the figure i i show the uh what's

1020
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,640
the relationship with this weapon access

1021
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,879
network access and termination point

1022
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:15,000
next slide please

1023
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,920
and this is another issue about the

1024
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,680
link specific

1025
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,839
metrics

1026
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,440
information that right now we only have

1027
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,000
for the logical link or the

1028
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,200
uh like uh the link uh in uh layer two

1029
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,000
or layer three uh network link

1030
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,920
then uh

1031
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,200
the uh mad uh proposed that

1032
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,599
we may add some class

1033
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,160
id specific uh counters

1034
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,880
to to show different uh

1035
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,880
metrics uh

1036
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,000
even uh they are in the same logical

1037
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,280
link for network link so

1038
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,800
here uh this is another uh issue we want

1039
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,880
to uh we think it's uh useful to

1040
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,480
to solve

1041
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,839
so next slide please

1042
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,079
uh here is also uh and some uh proposal

1043
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,680
to to change

1044
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,119
to uh

1045
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,599
the cont to change the container right

1046
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,760
now it's a a

1047
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,520
container and we we think we may change

1048
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,040
to it list

1049
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,480
and use class id as a key

1050
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,920
so that

1051
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,119
for each link they can show different

1052
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,280
class ids performance monitor statistics

1053
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,119
so

1054
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,000
next slide please

1055
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,839
right now uh this is all the uh open

1056
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,520
issues but uh

1057
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,880
since we also uh got some comments from

1058
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,520
the mailing list that greg uh proposed

1059
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,400
that

1060
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,280
uh please go back to to this

1061
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,119
previous slides

1062
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,280
a little bit yeah

1063
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,280
grad also made the comments on this

1064
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,839
delay statistics of this

1065
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,040
link performance monitoring statistics

1066
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,599
he thought that the direction definition

1067
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,560
is quite confusing because uh this link

1068
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,440
uh

1069
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,920
it's uh it's supposed to be unit

1070
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,319
direction but uh we we

1071
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:35,520
we define direction seems quite uh

1072
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,480
quite confusing because uh

1073
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,200
because in our definition it shows its

1074
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,480
uh

1075
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,319
will be a one-way or two-way uh

1076
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,800
for this direction

1077
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,400
configuration so

1078
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,400
i thought that uh this is quite

1079
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,480
confusing because unit direction only

1080
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,720
shows this is a can

1081
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,319
can only have one-way uh delay so he

1082
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,839
proposed we

1083
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,359
we change uh change this direction to

1084
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,960
some source but

1085
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,079
we already have some pm source defined

1086
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,280
for this link specific one so

1087
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,319
we are thinking we are so we are

1088
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,119
proposed to remove this direction to

1089
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,000
to make it clear

1090
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,920
okay uh next night piece

1091
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,960
so that's all the issue pending issue

1092
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,040
and we we are

1093
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,319
planning to solve this pen after meeting

1094
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,760
so

1095
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,280
we'd like to hear

1096
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,599
other comments from working group

1097
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,520
and to see

1098
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,480
if you have an any other suggestion on

1099
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,119
this modeling i think we have time for

1100
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,359
just one question and elliott is in the

1101
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,040
queue so elliott

1102
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,359
yeah hi sorry for taking up the the

1103
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,440
question slots so much if we could go

1104
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,520
back to slide five for just one moment

1105
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,960
this is just a point of clarification um

1106
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,240
is the the new um

1107
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,480
are the new elements under vpn networks

1108
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,800
uh access statistics are those meant to

1109
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,560
be aggregates

1110
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,800
of uh the of the pm uh

1111
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,560
uh statistics

1112
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,599
or art or or am i or am i misunderst or

1113
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,720
is it the content inside the vpn or

1114
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,359
i'm not quite sure what what is meant by

1115
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,359
those objects can you say just two more

1116
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,400
words or two more sentences on that

1117
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,160
okay actually this vpn uh network

1118
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,440
access definition they are from layer 2

1119
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,240
or

1120
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,480
nm and layer 3 and m

1121
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,880
and here uh because it's

1122
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,079
only showed in vpn uh overlay uh

1123
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,520
topology

1124
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,359
and but

1125
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:50,800
actually uh

1126
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,599
since the one termination point may

1127
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,240
be related with multiple vpn services

1128
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,000
so

1129
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,440
the authors think that we may

1130
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,880
show some vpn access specific one

1131
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,560
counters because they they could be

1132
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,839
different

1133
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,240
there could be some physical one

1134
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,960
represented by termination points

1135
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,240
counters

1136
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,359
but we could have some like vpn could

1137
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,160
use sub-interface

1138
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,440
in that way they have their own counters

1139
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,240
so

1140
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,200
can i answer your question

1141
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,079
uh sort of i would just say um

1142
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,319
in the interest of time that it should

1143
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,640
be really clear where the statistic

1144
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,720
where the counters what the counters are

1145
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,200
counting in terms of the ascii art and i

1146
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,040
think that would probably help that's

1147
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,880
not something we normally do but i think

1148
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,240
in this case because there's so much

1149
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,599
virtualization

1150
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,920
you might want to just give an example

1151
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,920
of where those counters actually are and

1152
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,839
what they're counting

1153
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,720
okay we can add an example to

1154
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,880
make it more clear

1155
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,400
thank you bo and and thanks for your

1156
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,880
presentation

1157
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,440
yeah thanks and elliot uh you sacrificed

1158
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,880
maybe some of your time but we will

1159
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,079
accommodate you two minutes

1160
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,800
um on discovering retrieving software

1161
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,520
transparency

1162
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,839
okay so so many times somebody had a

1163
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,440
timer this is a draft from scott and

1164
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,280
myself that we adopted a little while

1165
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,880
ago uh next slide please um

1166
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,599
the uh this is all about uh what

1167
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,920
software is on a system and what

1168
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,440
vulnerabilities does the software have

1169
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,200
next slide please

1170
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,640
we talked about this all the same time

1171
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,240
there is an entire architecture around

1172
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,400
this but this extension

1173
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,800
is mostly around the upper left side in

1174
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,559
terms of how

1175
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,880
we learn where an s-bomb is in a

1176
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,880
deployment and so it's an extension to

1177
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,760
mud

1178
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,760
um to to basically point to uh where and

1179
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,599
where one could get an spdx file a

1180
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,760
cyclone dx file or a csaf file for that

1181
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,800
matter

1182
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,800
it's format neutral next slide please

1183
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,040
okay so we've done the yang doctors

1184
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,319
review what we've done is we've removed

1185
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:13,920
the ability to have csaf local

1186
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,720
information that's because

1187
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,559
vulnerabilities are generally announced

1188
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,319
elsewhere that and not generally on the

1189
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,000
device itself

1190
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,640
um and so

1191
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,359
that's the the only change really in in

1192
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,040
terms of substance

1193
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,440
um and it's worth discussion on the list

1194
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,960
i'm not sure if i have a next slide but

1195
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,800
maybe next slide

1196
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,160
um

1197
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,160
yeah discuss so the only thing is i

1198
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,240
think we need some more of the reviews

1199
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,079
before we go to working group last call

1200
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,160
which i was hoping to do i'd like to see

1201
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,319
a little bit more implementation on the

1202
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,720
part of the open c2 people and i'm

1203
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,079
talking to them

1204
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,000
uh already and then we're discussing

1205
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
this in other contexts as well so i

1206
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,520
think there needs to be probably one

1207
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,599
more update but the reviews should

1208
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,319
continue so security review uh an apps

1209
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,319
review for dot well known still needs to

1210
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,760
be done and the chairs i would

1211
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,599
appreciate if you guys could facilitate

1212
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:04,960
that

1213
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,800
okay this is i guess a chair uh thank

1214
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,760
you for your update i think we will

1215
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,359
press the appropriate buttons there

1216
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,400
to give you a review in parallel to the

1217
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,680
ongoing tasks thank you

1218
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,720
which moves us to the end of the adopted

1219
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,839
work and we can go on to the life cycle

1220
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,480
management operations item

1221
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,280
folding up next

1222
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,078
oh sorry

1223
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,000
thank you it's uh marisol palmeiro here

1224
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,680
um

1225
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,160
working in cisco cisco systems i'm based

1226
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,800
in madrid bienvenidos uh

1227
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,200
uh is the part of

1228
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,200
um

1229
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,319
we are really uh happy uh to present and

1230
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:59,760
introduce this draft uh we submitted

1231
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,960
this uh

1232
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,520
draft in august this year and now we

1233
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,319
have been publishing a revision two

1234
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,559
together with frank brockners slender

1235
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:09,760
kumar

1236
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,240
switovandari camilo cardona

1237
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,400
and with that we can go to the next

1238
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,720
slide

1239
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,920
data model for life cycle management and

1240
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,280
operations

1241
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,880
and the purpose and what we envision is

1242
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,040
to facilitate life cycle management and

1243
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,079
operations of an asset

1244
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,040
in order to enhance and improve

1245
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,839
the ability to quantify user experience

1246
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:38,880
and with that i want to reiterate what

1247
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,720
we mean with an asset

1248
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,520
and when we refer to an asset it is not

1249
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,000
only referring to a hardware

1250
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,319
physical device but considering as well

1251
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,720
any viral instance of a software

1252
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:55,119
including applications system or service

1253
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,720
also when referring to life cycle

1254
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,680
management and operations we would like

1255
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,400
to we want to cover on the draft the

1256
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,599
different states since we

1257
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,040
as users could select

1258
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,760
this asset that we have been defining

1259
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,480
and

1260
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,000
there are different options right

1261
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,200
depending on the features and the

1262
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,280
capabilities that that specific asset

1263
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,400
can offer

1264
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,359
there is a selection process on it

1265
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:25,359
you can buy you need to place

1266
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,599
to do the placement of the asset and the

1267
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,839
installation with this

1268
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:33,119
we are getting into that life cycle

1269
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,520
you need to license the asset and even

1270
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,040
the feature

1271
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,520
you will need to select with features or

1272
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,880
capabilities

1273
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,079
of your

1274
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,480
network device or software application

1275
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,800
you need to enable you will need to

1276
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,760
start measuring and here will come

1277
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,520
more on operations

1278
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,480
data

1279
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,680
you start start using that specific

1280
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,118
feature and you will start

1281
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,839
working on the operations it might be

1282
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,760
false it might be performance issues

1283
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,760
that you will need to open

1284
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,760
support case management or incident

1285
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,280
management incidents with your support

1286
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,000
escalation team or from your third party

1287
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,440
vendor as an user and

1288
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,000
just to close the lifecycle management

1289
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,800
you

1290
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,040
might need as well to renew and update

1291
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,280
those assets at a certain point right to

1292
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,920
make sure that you can continue

1293
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,240
working with that specific

1294
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,440
assets in the best way

1295
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,760
with that we can go to the next slides

1296
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,040
where i will

1297
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,319
i would like to highlight on the

1298
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,559
motivation right and the problem

1299
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,640
statements on the data model for lmo

1300
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:52,880
today we have a good number of standards

1301
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,119
looking at operations that will allow us

1302
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:57,920
to have a good reference and metrics

1303
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,559
understanding how our networks are

1304
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:01,839
behaving

1305
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,880
measuring performance capacity and even

1306
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,200
detecting faults all this is the work of

1307
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,880
our network and engineers but we don't

1308
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,000
have to forget

1309
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,880
that we could collect other metrics that

1310
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,400
might not be that relevant to the

1311
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,480
day-to-day but will help to analyze

1312
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,440
proactively our networks as well

1313
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,960
and um with this we have new roles uh as

1314
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,200
well that come into the pictures data

1315
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,000
science teams business leaders project

1316
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,920
managers and architects and even

1317
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,720
developers right that could benefit for

1318
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,760
some

1319
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,520
business data that are not really

1320
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,319
related to the operations and this is

1321
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,240
one of the main

1322
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,480
objectives of this

1323
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,760
definition

1324
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,960
of

1325
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,839
lmo and the data model defined for for

1326
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,559
lmo i want to reference the work done by

1327
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,119
even atlas and frank brockners that they

1328
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:04,079
presented into itf in the in march 2019

1329
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,480
and you have the reference there where

1330
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,200
they were addressing the linkage between

1331
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:09,850
networking

1332
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:11,119
[Music]

1333
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:15,599
data applications data and business data

1334
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,559
with that we can go to the next slide

1335
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,680
where we are highlighting the uh

1336
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,240
in this draft we are covering a few use

1337
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,520
cases we understand that it might be for

1338
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,680
much more and we could address much more

1339
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,079
use cases but this is an example of the

1340
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,599
motivation to

1341
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:34,640
get to

1342
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,319
write this draft

1343
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,079
if

1344
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:41,040
we have been adding the revision and two

1345
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,880
assets in use

1346
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,760
but

1347
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,880
if you allow me to refer

1348
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,040
just to the risk mitigation check as an

1349
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,000
example

1350
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,400
proactively depending on the features

1351
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,040
and

1352
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,799
capabilities that are running in a

1353
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,240
certain assets

1354
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,240
you can proactively

1355
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,119
understand uh based on on the hardware

1356
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:02,720
and software that is running as well on

1357
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,400
your uh

1358
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,880
different uh networking devices of

1359
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,599
software applications what could be a

1360
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,799
risk right that it could benefit to

1361
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:15,440
run better those networks

1362
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,160
and this is an example of how this

1363
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,078
motivation check might be implemented

1364
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,839
going to the next slides and

1365
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:27,440
just trying to

1366
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,559
go to the

1367
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,960
next steps as well but we have been

1368
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,480
identifying four main data sets

1369
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,960
uh with different attributes on it

1370
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:42,160
highlighting assets as a main centric

1371
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,400
point of our draft

1372
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,200
but also covering licensing's licenses

1373
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,440
usage as part of the features and

1374
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,720
capabilities

1375
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,280
of of that asset and

1376
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,200
incident that might be linked to an

1377
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,520
asset or even to a feature that we

1378
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:01,599
upgraded as well in the revision co2

1379
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,359
and finished

1380
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,760
with the next slide

1381
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,240
our asks and next steps we welcome and

1382
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,240
appreciate feedback for for the from the

1383
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,680
working group

1384
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,480
and

1385
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,480
at the moment we are

1386
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,440
looking how to improve the attributes

1387
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,799
that we have been

1388
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:21,839
defining in the young modules

1389
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,720
evolving some of those attributes like

1390
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,720
it could be assets in use

1391
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,920
address

1392
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,200
how

1393
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,200
we identify from the management point of

1394
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,680
view and asset with that mark an ip

1395
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,520
address we have been introducing new

1396
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,960
attributes for it

1397
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,839
considering additional attributes to

1398
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,319
cover concepts like

1399
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:44,160
combo

1400
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,160
options for features and assets within

1401
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,400
licensing and also we have been

1402
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,400
addressing in version 0.2 and we have

1403
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,480
still to reiterate on that how to

1404
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,119
identify an organization and the

1405
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:57,599
hierarchy for it

1406
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,599
with that i know i have only three

1407
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:01,119
minutes for questions but i open the

1408
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:05,480
floor for questions thank you very much

1409
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:18,559
so uh

1410
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,720
i i believe in the past this draft make

1411
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,440
love sense i still believe this makes a

1412
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,040
lot of sense that could be very

1413
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,920
important in the future obviously

1414
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,760
one small detail about

1415
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,480
the naming convention uh it's not really

1416
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,599
about life cycle management and because

1417
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,440
everything is collecting information

1418
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,040
right all the things in your young

1419
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,280
modules is read only

1420
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,880
i've not been thinking about good name

1421
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,400
it's not too important but just

1422
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,839
something to observe and even your

1423
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:48,400
abstract mentioned collects

1424
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,640
now in the industry this is the third

1425
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,799
point in history is that

1426
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,359
we start to see many inventories

1427
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,960
right so you could get things from the

1428
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,720
network elements you could get things

1429
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,559
from the young catalog and joe and i

1430
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:02,000
wrote a draft on you know how to

1431
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,440
retrieve

1432
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,200
how to

1433
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,359
even mention what is a platform what is

1434
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:11,040
an os etc we start to have capabilities

1435
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,559
discovery in the context of telemetry

1436
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,400
you'll see a draft about

1437
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,599
a data manifest uh later in the session

1438
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,119
so we start to see more and more of

1439
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:23,760
these inventory high-level information

1440
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,200
that are network-wide more

1441
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,440
business-oriented so really want to make

1442
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,280
sure that we align

1443
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,440
on the definition of all these right

1444
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,640
because

1445
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,520
if this drive becomes very important it

1446
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,720
will be a success if it's multi-vendor

1447
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,200
right because in the end most networks

1448
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,440
are just multi-vendor so this is

1449
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,119
something that you have to work on and

1450
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,280
there are things that scare me in their

1451
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,680
like licensing right trying to get

1452
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,240
multi-vendor and licensing model in

1453
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,680
there it's like it's a tough one

1454
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,960
so happy to

1455
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,880
to help you on this one

1456
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,640
perfect thank you benoit and really

1457
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,520
appreciate i i i the comments that you

1458
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,920
made you were right right on the naming

1459
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,640
we were discussing internally how to

1460
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,839
get to an a good name and uh we are not

1461
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:14,480
close to change that if if it's required

1462
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,160
internally within cisco we call it

1463
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,440
differently

1464
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,599
but uh yeah i really appreciate on the

1465
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,359
comments as well to align with other

1466
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:23,040
drafts we have been already doing an

1467
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,920
exercise with elliot on

1468
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,400
considering his bomb and yeah it would

1469
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,960
be really good to align

1470
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,640
and make it multi-vendor this is our

1471
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,160
purpose as well

1472
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:34,960
yeah

1473
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,599
to consider that

1474
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:41,839
marisol you have quite a few um

1475
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:45,520
steps here and benoit touched on uh a

1476
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,319
couple of others um these are would be

1477
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,799
great things to bring to the list and

1478
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:53,200
discuss as you you look to make these

1479
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,400
decisions

1480
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,440
um again assuming you want to take this

1481
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,240
draft further in ops awg having that

1482
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,440
those conversations and engaging the the

1483
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,799
broader operations and vendor interests

1484
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:08,720
would be extremely useful and i think

1485
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,119
you've got some good items here i'm

1486
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:13,200
particularly interested in the last one

1487
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,319
but we're out of time so i would like to

1488
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:17,920
hear more about what you're thinking

1489
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,760
there and and hear about it in the

1490
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,559
public forum

1491
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,680
perfect point taken

1492
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,640
yo

1493
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,960
i will make for sure follow up on the

1494
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,000
forum

1495
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,799
on the questions

1496
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:36,319
thank you very much

1497
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,200
okay we have kenneth i believe up next

and

1499
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,118
i think these are the slides

1500
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:55,839
ken i just saw you

1501
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,640
and you went away

1502
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,880
there he is

1503
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,119
take it away

1504
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,240
well

1505
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,200
he went away again

1506
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,319
we can't hear you if you're talking ken

1507
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,440
while uh

1508
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,160
ken gets set up here um remember if you

1509
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,440
have any items for ops area the open mic

1510
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,760
please just let us know in the chat so

1511
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,359
we can

1512
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:40,880
know to budget that time

1513
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,079
we're kind of on schedule but

1514
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:45,920
we're having some technical difficulties

1515
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,960
it seems if need be we can

1516
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,119
we can push you ken and if you're having

1517
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,359
trouble we can move to uh

1518
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:55,440
the next speaker i don't know let me see

1519
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,880
if there's anything happening in the

1520
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,160
chat

1521
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:02,038
i don't see anything

1522
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:08,640
let's um

1523
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,280
let's move to uh

1524
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,160
the

1525
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,480
inband flow learning i don't know sorry

1526
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,720
we'll back to you benoit we'll go to uh

1527
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,280
manifest for streaming telemetry which

1528
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,319
is next because dan needs to move to the

1529
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:27,680
um the end and ken will come back to you

1530
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,200
right after benoit's presentation here

1531
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,920
just so we can keep things moving so i

1532
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,079
need manifest something

1533
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,640
there we go

1534
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,920
so benoit and ken will hopefully you'll

1535
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,680
be sorted out and we'll come back to you

1536
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,960
very good

1537
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,240
let me just put my food away

1538
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,359
okay data manifesto streaming telemetry

1539
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:56,720
so that's a draft on behalf of jean

1540
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,520
my colleague diego lopez telefonica and

1541
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,599
thomas graf swisscom

1542
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:04,079
which uh who i believe are in the call

1543
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:06,079
so if i see anything wrong feel free to

1544
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:07,200
correct me

1545
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,078
next slide please

1546
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,359
okay so uh

1547
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:16,000
what is the issue we start to

1548
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,240
have an industry money

1549
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,520
capability discovery from routers even

1550
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,559
the per node recovery discoveries

1551
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:27,280
like the first two drafts are in there

1552
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,400
to uh

1553
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,559
you know tell you what you could do with

1554
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:32,799
uh streaming telemetry

1555
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:34,640
the third one tells you

1556
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,280
what you could be doing with uh

1557
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,440
you know whether a per node as the

1558
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,640
quality of unchanged or not

1559
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,760
what is the current or the minimum

1560
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,280
cadence you could get anything like this

1561
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,119
the big question that we're asking now

1562
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:53,440
is

1563
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,760
what is actually how is this actually

1564
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,960
metered under what circumstances

1565
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,160
right

1566
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,598
so if you go to the next slide

1567
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:07,359
let's say that you've got in your data

1568
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:09,280
collection system which is by the way

1569
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,640
generic term

1570
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,720
it could be the collector the controller

1571
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,960
the orchestrator a big data lake and

1572
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,440
you've got the value 42.

1573
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,039
what does it mean

1574
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:22,000
the bare minimum is that for this object

1575
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,520
which is stored

1576
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,520
in xml or json is to get the

1577
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,839
corresponding yang object to get some

1578
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:30,160
sort of semantic behind it

1579
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,160
but is this sufficient

1580
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,079
uh we don't think so

1581
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:37,680
because if you receive the value 42 and

1582
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,119
a single value

1583
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:41,440
can you assume that you receive this as

1584
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,440
unchanged

1585
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,599
maybe not maybe it was simply the only

1586
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,799
value that you are receiving

1587
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,799
or if you receive a collection period

1588
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:52,400
and in your time series you see the

1589
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,680
value

1590
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,559
second 6 11 17

1591
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:57,839
whatever

1592
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,400
what was the initial cadence that you

1593
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,200
were actually requesting

1594
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,000
what was the cadence that you received

1595
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,160
maybe because the device is busy maybe

1596
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,319
because it's under stress maybe because

1597
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:12,880
it's unsupported

1598
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,000
whatever

1599
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,400
even the the router os

1600
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,880
like you receive 42 but from two

1601
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,400
different routers

1602
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,680
an old one with an old os with a bug

1603
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,640
a new one with a new os without a bug

1604
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,960
so it's key if you want to interpret the

1605
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:29,920
data

1606
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,799
it's key to get the context

1607
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:36,160
so if you go to the next slide

1608
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,760
the proposal is to get like two young

1609
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,240
modules

1610
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,599
the first one would be one about

1611
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,920
the platform manifests

1612
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,839
and the second one being the data

1613
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,599
manifests i'm going to cover what it

1614
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:53,599
means but just to make the link with

1615
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:56,000
what i said too to marisol in the

1616
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,920
previous session is that we start to see

1617
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,000
many of those type of inventory or

1618
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,400
context information

1619
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,440
so this information about the context

1620
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,400
must be streamed with the data

1621
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,400
and store along with the collecting data

1622
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,799
so if you stream the data somewhere else

1623
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:14,640
like in the end maybe in a big data lake

1624
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,119
for further analysis

1625
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:20,559
the context must follow

1626
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:21,599
now

1627
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:24,400
this must be and we just i just showed

1628
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,640
in the previous uh

1629
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,599
slides the instant draft which is right

1630
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:31,760
now in the rfc editor queue which is a

1631
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,319
draft that gives you a file based on the

1632
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:36,480
yang format and this is the way that

1633
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,000
this information should be stored

1634
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,480
so if we if we go to the next slide

1635
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,039
so two young modules

1636
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:50,160
one is the platform manifest

1637
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,640
so typically what is the hardware model

1638
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,119
what is the os type what is the version

1639
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:57,680
and with the old draft that joe clark

1640
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,920
and i wrote which is the yang module

1641
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,839
behind the yang catalog

1642
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:04,160
we have identified we have

1643
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,160
we attempted to model those values

1644
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,559
and since those values are used in the

1645
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:11,760
catalog

1646
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,760
and there are people introducing you

1647
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,599
know with a file called platform

1648
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:18,080
metadata they're introducing information

1649
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,399
about those device we could be reusing

1650
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:22,000
it

1651
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,439
now

1652
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:25,600
we also want to send

1653
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,080
uh or to link

1654
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,238
the information about the available yang

1655
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:32,719
modules but also deviation

1656
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,040
that are on that device

1657
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,439
again if i take the example of router 1

1658
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:40,479
old and router 2 new without the bug

1659
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:43,040
maybe the deviations are different

1660
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,279
so that's also something that we need to

1661
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:47,439
interpret the data

1662
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:48,719
when would you change its platform

1663
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:49,920
manifest

1664
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,839
when there is a change in the platform

1665
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,319
typically a reboot

1666
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,920
a new os something like that

1667
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,399
in the next slide

1668
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,479
slide you would see

1669
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:05,359
the pian3 of all the

1670
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:06,880
the information

1671
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,120
the first curly bracket

1672
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,600
comes from the yang model behind the

1673
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,120
yang catalog

1674
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,839
and the second one comes we just reuse

1675
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:18,799
the yang library

1676
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:20,960
module okay

1677
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,920
in the next slide

1678
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,600
we speak about the data manifests

1679
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,759
so in there we we want to show person

1680
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:33,520
surpass

1681
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,080
the information whether polling or

1682
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,040
change is used remember if i receive the

1683
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,759
single value of 42 what does it mean

1684
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,920
whether suppressed we don't see is used

1685
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,799
meaning that it's a feature where

1686
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:49,040
if you're going to send the same value

1687
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,279
well actually don't send it the value

1688
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:53,920
has not changed it's still 42

1689
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,679
but it's still important to understand

1690
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:57,600
if you're having polling with super

1691
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,840
presidency or change

1692
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,000
the requested collection period and what

1693
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,840
is the current one

1694
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,440
maybe because it's not supported maybe

1695
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,199
because the routers are stressed

1696
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:08,719
whatever

1697
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:11,760
and we update this data manifest

1698
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,320
whenever the collection condition

1699
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,040
changes you've got a new subscription or

1700
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,880
a different collection or something

1701
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,000
change

1702
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,480
now we speak a lot about ai and machine

1703
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,159
learning so if you want to analyze the

1704
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:26,159
data it's important to get all the

1705
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:27,679
context

1706
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:31,520
so in the next slide

1707
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,719
we see the pian3

1708
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:35,600
uh

1709
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,640
for the information of the data manifest

1710
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,560
sensor pass requested period current

1711
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:43,120
period unchanged presidency and we might

1712
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:46,480
be having more in the future

1713
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,360
okay in the

1714
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,080
next slide

1715
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,760
so this is the basic idea i've been

1716
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,199
showing you so far

1717
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:57,199
what are the improvements that we've

1718
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:59,280
been identifying

1719
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,520
clearly identify how data manifest

1720
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,120
should be collected

1721
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,960
well telemetry makes sense right you

1722
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,679
just push this along with the data but

1723
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:10,080
do you want to acknowledge it do we want

1724
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,960
to set on a regular basis is this per

1725
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,280
subscription id or person surpass

1726
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,480
and we also want to to include a source

1727
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,239
of data

1728
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:23,760
well if it comes from the router we

1729
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,679
might trust it if it comes from the

1730
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:28,560
young catalog maybe if it comes from a

1731
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,280
controller maybe but there is some some

1732
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,040
some importance to flag where it's

1733
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,600
coming from

1734
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,800
and on next slide

1735
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,280
we still have some open question

1736
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,560
so feel free to discuss that on the

1737
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,159
mailing list or wherever

1738
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:46,159
how to map data manifest the corrected

1739
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:49,600
data let's say you are in influx db

1740
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:53,120
how would you tag some specific

1741
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,679
objects with a time series telling well

1742
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,159
the data manifest is the first one or

1743
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:00,320
the second one

1744
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,400
so the other question if i stream from a

1745
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,120
line card do i need to send the like

1746
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,600
information

1747
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,600
and maybe a one which is maybe

1748
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,920
foot or fart let's say do we want to

1749
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,480
handle data manifest for non-telemetry

1750
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,879
value

1751
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:23,600
so uh in conclusion in the last slide

1752
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,920
we propose to normalize the way

1753
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,520
contextual information about data

1754
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,920
collection is stored

1755
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,080
it should be safe with the data moved

1756
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,800
with the data and would allow us as a

1757
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,760
later

1758
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,320
reusability or later

1759
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,159
contact information

1760
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:42,080
to sorry let me rephrase that it will

1761
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,640
allow us later not to use the context to

1762
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,040
interpret the data

1763
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,280
so there is

1764
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:52,880
github which updated in the data tracker

1765
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,679
so feel free to give me your feedback on

1766
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:56,960
this

1767
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,920
thank you that's it for me

1768
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,360
we have elliot and rob and hey oh my we

1769
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,800
have a lot we're not going to be able to

1770
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,040
take everyone but let's uh elliot let's

1771
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,800
start with you

1772
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,880
what i've talked enough i'll skip me go

1773
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,440
to the next guy

1774
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,000
actually i've put my question in the

1775
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,320
chat so then i can see it there my quick

1776
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,400
comment is have the platform manifest

1777
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,560
have you considered using yang packages

1778
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,560
as a way of describing

1779
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,400
um what the yang modules are supported

1780
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:29,760
which gives you hierarchical

1781
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,600
capabilities but i can discuss something

1782
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,199
on the list describe it if that's

1783
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:34,400
helpful

1784
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:38,239
very quickly that's a great idea yes

1785
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:42,080
thank you so this is a chair um so so we

1786
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,719
we have this uh there's this s-bomb

1787
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:47,199
effort and and now you are trying to do

1788
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:50,080
manifests that are literally the the

1789
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,400
contents and the provenances of the

1790
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,520
things you want to uh uh run

1791
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,080
is there overlap

1792
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,640
that was my point to marisol uh in the

1793
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,480
precession that we start to see all

1794
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,640
these type of inventory

1795
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,440
and we would need to harmonize all this

1796
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:10,080
okay so that should be an a dedicated

1797
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,440
effort and i i would happy to uh to

1798
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,600
contribute to to organizing that thank

1799
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,679
you

1800
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:21,199
frank is that a quick question if not uh

1801
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:23,120
might need to take it to the list yeah

1802
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,199
it's a quick one um i think that's to

1803
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:26,719
the earlier comment i think it would

1804
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,960
make sense to go and delineate pure

1805
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,600
inventory type things

1806
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,520
um that you have in the draft from

1807
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,280
things that are again about runtime

1808
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,560
information

1809
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,280
uh because um collection cadence actual

1810
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,040
collection cadence in those settings are

1811
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,719
again about operational runtime

1812
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:44,000
information and we might want to go and

1813
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,920
treat them differently

1814
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,600
because also the accuracy of what you

1815
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,120
can retrieve from an operational

1816
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,199
perspective collection cadence been a

1817
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:54,239
really a big can of warmth

1818
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,320
as opposed to things that are kind of

1819
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,800
static like hardware id uh router

1820
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,800
version and the likes and i would agree

1821
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,719
that i think we want to go and merge

1822
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:05,520
certain pieces with murray salzburg

1823
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,760
thank you

1824
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,480
i obviously agree with your statement

1825
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,600
that there are two different types of

1826
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,920
data

1827
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,679
thank you very much benoit seems like

1828
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,080
there's great conversation to be had on

1829
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,679
this work and

1830
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,320
ken says he's

1831
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,280
back

1832
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:31,280
um now i'm trying to ah there it is

1833
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:33,840
okay i can hear you

1834
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,280
great um

1835
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,120
so i am gonna discuss a little bit about

1836
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,199
what we're doing in its and how we're

1837
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:41,760
using snmp and the reason we need to

1838
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,800
update it to 1.3 for tls

1839
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,520
so next slide

1840
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,480
so within the

1841
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,640
its community intelligent transport

1842
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,920
systems we are using this as a primary

1843
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,239
standard for exchanging information with

1844
01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:00,880
our field devices both back to central

1845
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,360
and with other field devices

1846
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,679
classic examples are what you see here

1847
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:07,520
with signal information being controlled

1848
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,760
back and forth obviously we need this to

1849
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:13,840
be very secure next slide

1850
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,719
so the

1851
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:18,640
cisa among others

1852
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,600
definitely recommend using snmpv3

1853
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,520
over uh basically dtls according to rfc

1854
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,159
6353

1855
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:31,199
that all makes sense as of oh two years

1856
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:34,000
ago and then there were some problems

1857
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,600
with 1.2

1858
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,199
so they've updated those standards now

1859
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,040
to 1.3

1860
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,360
what we're looking for is basically an

1861
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,679
update of 6353

1862
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:46,320
to clarify exactly how we

1863
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:47,440
implement

1864
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,080
snmp over tls

1865
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:54,000
1.3 now or dtls 1.3 either one

1866
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,400
next slide

1867
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,560
so with that

1868
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,520
the its community

1869
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,920
realized that no active effort was being

1870
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,719
undertaken in the ietf right now

1871
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:08,400
so we looked at different things we

1872
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,800
looked at changing protocols completely

1873
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,800
we recognize that

1874
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,199
among a lot of people snmp is kind of

1875
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:16,560
out of favor now

1876
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,719
uh but nonetheless when we looked at

1877
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,360
different options the its community

1878
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,280
decided that

1879
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,360
it is much better for us to stay with

1880
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,320
snmp given our investment today

1881
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,760
given its features uh it does what we

1882
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,040
need it to do

1883
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:36,560
so the plan is to stick with snmp

1884
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,159
and ideally

1885
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:41,840
create the update to 1.3 within the ietf

1886
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,440
and that's one of the reasons that i've

1887
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,000
been asked to come present to you today

1888
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
we have put together a draft and we

1889
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,920
would like to have that draft adopted by

1890
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,679
the ietf

1891
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:53,280
uh and we're very interested in working

1892
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,239
with you

1893
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:55,120
um

1894
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,040
the alternative is it would probably be

1895
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,480
developed as our own

1896
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,159
internal standard but it makes a lot

1897
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:02,719
more sense to work through the ietf

1898
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:05,280
next slide

1899
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:07,600
so um

1900
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,520
just as a quick summary of the changes

1901
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,920
that are needed the driving changes i

1902
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,199
alluded to

1903
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:16,239
is updating 1.3

1904
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:20,239
tls 1.3 uses a

1905
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:23,760
2 octet identifier for the cyber suite

1906
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,800
now

1907
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,800
sorry cipher suite now

1908
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,239
rather than

1909
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:30,960
a one octet for the hash algorithm and

1910
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,600
another one octet for the encryption

1911
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,040
algorithm

1912
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,360
that changes the fingerprint that's

1913
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,520
recorded within the

1914
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:42,560
rfc 6353 mids

1915
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,280
and that creates some ambiguities of how

1916
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,199
all of that should be handled a couple

1917
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:49,280
different ways to resolve this

1918
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,040
we're not really too concerned which

1919
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,560
approach we use

1920
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,760
benefits and challenges either way

1921
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,000
but that's one issue to be resolved and

1922
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,360
and that's really the driving issue

1923
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,040
there are other clarifications that

1924
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,199
should be made such as updating

1925
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:07,360
references clarifying authentication

1926
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:11,120
privacy are always provided next slide

1927
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,600
and then some more subjective changes

1928
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,840
uh such as whether we use zero rtt and

1929
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:18,960
other issues

1930
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,199
so if we've identified all of those in

1931
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:24,080
our draft we've made proposals

1932
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,000
but we're willing to negotiate any of

1933
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,120
these the key is reaching consensus so

1934
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,040
that all implementations do it the same

1935
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,080
way

1936
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,960
and next slide

1937
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,280
so uh

1938
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,120
that really brings us down to three

1939
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,679
major questions the first of which is

1940
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:42,640
you know

1941
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,280
we presented this actually at the last

1942
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,239
ietf meeting to the security dispatch

1943
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:49,600
group

1944
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,440
they liked the idea

1945
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,719
they ended up

1946
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:54,880
pushing this over to the uh to this

1947
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,760
working group as its natural home

1948
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,960
uh so

1949
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,880
does yapzog wish to adopt this work

1950
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,800
and then if we assuming that we do do

1951
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,760
that

1952
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,600
then how do we best address the

1953
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,360
fingerprint issue

1954
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,520
do we revise the mib which ends up being

1955
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,400
a fairly significant revision or do we

1956
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,960
just simply require iana to maintain one

1957
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,000
hot hash identifier which might

1958
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
otherwise go away and create problems

1959
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,239
the other big issue is the document

1960
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:29,840
format do we make this an update to rfc

1961
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,440
6353

1962
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,639
do we obsolete that document and replace

1963
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:37,760
it with our new one or do we create a

1964
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,159
new parallel document and they both

1965
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:43,040
can potentially exist in the future

1966
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,560
those are all things that we can discuss

1967
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,239
via the reflector but i'm happy to

1968
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:49,040
accept comments

1969
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,600
yes hey uh thanks thanks ken for the for

1970
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,760
this presentation um

1971
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,920
i just have a question for you

1972
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:04,960
which is

1973
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,239
how

1974
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:10,800
well fielded do you believe rfc 6353 is

1975
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,040
in its

1976
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:18,000
somewhat limited right now

1977
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,080
uh it is

1978
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,679
um

1979
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:24,719
our security is not where it needs to be

1980
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:29,360
uh there is a major effort within the

1981
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:30,719
federal highway administration to

1982
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,560
improve our security

1983
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:36,320
and this is a part of that effort

1984
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,719
okay yeah if um

1985
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:41,280
i think that goes to what we do with the

1986
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,960
document format just

1987
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,600
from my purposes i think uh we should

1988
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,880
stop playing ping pong with this

1989
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,400
document if

1990
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,159
um

1991
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:50,960
if

1992
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,760
it seems reasonable to get us to tls 1.3

1993
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,000
it's not a small effort we just went

1994
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,199
through this with with an emu for eep

1995
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:00,719
it takes a little bit of work you're

1996
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:02,000
doing the work

1997
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,679
uh you seem to have a community of

1998
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:04,800
interest

1999
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,440
to do the work you know assuming

2000
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,239
that

2001
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:10,880
uh other participants are willing to

2002
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,199
step up and say yeah i'll implement then

2003
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:14,880
i think we should adopt

2004
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,400
um but

2005
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,719
i also think this work needs to be

2006
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:21,760
really closely brought back to

2007
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,440
the tls working group just so that they

2008
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,199
know what's going on because

2009
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:28,239
ops area doesn't have tls expertise the

2010
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:30,960
tls working group has tls expertise so

2011
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,560
you know without getting into inside

2012
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:33,920
baseball

2013
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:36,719
in terms of the work being done like i'd

2014
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:38,400
say yeah as long as people are willing

2015
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,520
to implement

2016
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,199
we work on the logistics to make sure

2017
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:43,520
that the tls experts are paying

2018
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,000
attention

2019
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:50,199
yep that sounds great

2020
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,840
got a few minutes left any other

2021
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,040
questions for kenneth

2022
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,199
rob

2023
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,520
um i'm just going to make a comment uh i

2024
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,960
don't know this is with lady hat on not

2025
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,040
really but i do think it's important

2026
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,520
that the itf should do this work um in

2027
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,360
the sense that i think it's important

2028
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,840
that we keep our protocol secure so i

2029
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,440
think it's a matter of finding what the

2030
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,239
best path through that is

2031
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:19,360
in terms of one of the questions here

2032
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,360
about updating or obsoleting i think

2033
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:23,280
that that depends on the size of the

2034
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:26,000
changes if it could be done sensibly as

2035
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,159
an update that might be

2036
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:31,679
um might be a better choice potentially

2037
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:34,400
but that can be worked out

2038
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,120
i think that has been brought up

2039
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,840
on the list already when kenneth raised

2040
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,600
this and um

2041
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,239
with the chair hat on uh i think it is

2042
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:46,080
worth bringing up

2043
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:48,320
the question of adoption i agree with

2044
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,920
elliot's comment that

2045
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:50,880
uh

2046
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,880
the ping-ponging probably isn't needed

2047
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,480
anymore we've got

2048
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:55,760
snmp

2049
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,719
expertise here and and if we can get the

2050
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:01,280
collaboration with tls and the working

2051
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,120
group wants to work on this we can

2052
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,360
certainly raise the question and see

2053
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,440
where to go from there and and rob i

2054
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,440
agree with you i i think the more

2055
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,120
tactical type change

2056
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,199
would be beneficial

2057
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:17,400
but that's going to need to be evaluated

2058
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,920
i don't see anyone else l.a unless

2059
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,760
you're in the queue to ask another

2060
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,760
question

2061
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:28,560
nope

2062
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,560
uh well kind of thank you very much uh

2063
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,960
we'll take the action to raise the the

2064
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,840
question of adoption uh to see what uh

2065
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,360
what the working group wants to do with

2066
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,040
this work since you've

2067
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,920
clearly put initial effort into it and

2068
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,320
see where we go from there all right

2069
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,880
thanks a lot

2070
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,360
so next we've got

2071
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:58,320
in-band flow learning

2072
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:02,239
uh let's see what's this one

2073
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,320
yeah i think

2074
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:24,000
it

2075
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,760
may just be me minshu but i cannot hear

2076
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,199
you at all

2077
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:31,120
unfortunately it's not just you it's

2078
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,560
also me

2079
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,679
you're very chopped up

2080
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:39,320
here again

2081
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,639
see

2082
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,159
i was presenting is it minzu

2083
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:57,199
yep

2084
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:59,759
yeah okay

2085
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:05,760
i'm

2086
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:06,719
moving

2087
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:09,440
from train number five okay

2088
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:13,040
um thank you chair so on behalf of other

2089
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,760
authors i'm going to present this draft

2090
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,960
of problem statement and requirement for

2091
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,360
in-band flow learning

2092
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,280
so this product is also

2093
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:28,080
proposed in ippm wt and and

2094
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,840
the authors discussed

2095
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,920
um we think it's more

2096
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,719
uh related to the operation and

2097
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:36,400
management functions

2098
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,520
um

2099
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:41,040
for flow performance monitoring so um

2100
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,440
today we present here to

2101
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,960
uh

2102
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:47,440
hope to achieve more suggestions

2103
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,320
okay

2104
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,840
so next time please

2105
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,400
so the objective of this contribution

2106
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,520
um is first to analyze the challenges of

2107
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:02,000
in-band flow learning identifications

2108
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,719
for the flow performance measurement in

2109
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,679
the operators networks

2110
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:11,840
so a large skill deployment of 4g and 5g

2111
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,920
wireless base stations and enterprise

2112
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:17,760
services may cause problems for us to

2113
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,159
deploy the implant flow learning

2114
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:22,719
and second are the requirements of

2115
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:25,840
inventory learning to solve the problems

2116
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,679
for deploying event

2117
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:30,800
performance monitoring and second

2118
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,360
to provide scenarios for the inventory

2119
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,840
learning including ingress flow learning

2120
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,480
egress flow learning and hope by hop

2121
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:42,000
flow learning and also auto flow aging

2122
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,120
so next next please

2123
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:49,840
yeah

2124
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:52,800
next time please

2125
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,120
i'm slide three now do you want slide

2126
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,440
four

2127
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,120
oh i can

2128
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:05,840
i can only see this two so

2129
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,719
that's okay okay okay step three

2130
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:11,120
so for the problem statements

2131
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,480
and

2132
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:15,440
uh first it is always difficult to get

2133
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:18,000
the flow informations in our real

2134
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,400
networks so including the

2135
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:23,440
characteristics like ports ip addresses

2136
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,840
dscps etc to

2137
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,400
set up the intense instance for the flow

2138
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,560
performance monitoring

2139
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,000
um

2140
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,880
for example in 4g and 5 t2c and

2141
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,960
2b is nervous

2142
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,440
because of some entire effects or base

2143
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,080
station adjustments and uvf extensions

2144
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,480
which are always hands in our networks

2145
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,800
so it will cause problems for us to

2146
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,199
gather the in flow informations

2147
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:53,280
and then for the enterprise services

2148
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,840
because of the difficulties to get the

2149
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,760
customers information

2150
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,040
so

2151
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,679
we will get problems for

2152
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:03,760
the deployment of the performance

2153
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,760
monitoring

2154
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,440
and second

2155
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,840
it is always hard to deploy and maintain

2156
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,760
the flow monitoring and

2157
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,320
the statistics telemetry in the static

2158
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:17,280
mode in large scale network

2159
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,840
so for the open um

2160
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:24,000
data by the end of march 2021 so um

2161
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,480
china mobile has already deployed

2162
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:30,400
404 410

2163
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:31,360
000

2164
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,400
uh

2165
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,000
5g stations

2166
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,480
and also we have 400 000

2167
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,480
slicing packing networks

2168
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:43,760
equipments for the backhoes

2169
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,719
and enterprise services

2170
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:49,679
so it is really a large scale of

2171
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:50,880
networks

2172
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,560
and

2173
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,880
and the third the traffic forwarding

2174
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,280
paths is changed because of service flow

2175
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,400
switching

2176
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,880
and the service protection and route

2177
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,239
convergency

2178
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:03,760
so when a

2179
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,960
hub by hub flow monitoring is required

2180
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:09,760
by some critical traffic for the deep

2181
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,760
soa investigation

2182
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,800
and the monetary instance are each nodes

2183
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,120
and they need to be redeployed on the

2184
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,480
new path

2185
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,800
so this is our problem statement and

2186
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,960
next step please

2187
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,440
and make sure you have uh your over your

2188
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,360
five minutes so if you can

2189
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,520
okay finish quickly

2190
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,159
i will quickly finish the requirements

2191
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:35,120
so uh the requirements for the uh

2192
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:38,320
implantable learning may involve ingress

2193
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,560
and egress for learning and how by

2194
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,199
helpful learning and so also the auto

2195
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:44,080
flow

2196
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,000
uh aging to

2197
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,280
uh recycle the resource okay

2198
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:52,560
so um because there's not enough time so

2199
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:56,880
i will just go next slide

2200
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,600
so the next step um

2201
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,679
so where we will update the draft

2202
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:03,679
according our

2203
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:05,840
feedbacks and later will propose more

2204
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,719
contributions on the mechanisms of the

2205
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:11,040
impactflow learning

2206
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,400
functions

2207
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:16,000
so also we want to discuss whether this

2208
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,760
kind of draft is

2209
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:22,880
can belong to ippm or obs awg okay

2210
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,400
thank you

2211
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,880
that's quite true um and i would suggest

2212
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:29,440
you bring it up on the uh on the list or

2213
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,840
question there about applicability and

2214
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:34,800
we can have a discussion thank you

2215
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,840
okay okay thank you

2216
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:42,480
all right uh talo i believe you are next

2217
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,400
on uh

2218
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:49,120
data model for optical network inventory

2219
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:50,560
somewhere

2220
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:53,280
yeah thank you can you hear me

2221
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:59,400
okay we can but i can't find your slides

2222
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,920
shoot

2223
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:07,800
let me see if i can

2224
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,719
sorry about that

2225
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:17,679
i think i didn't have them

2226
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:20,320
processed

2227
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,159
all right

2228
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,080
there we go sorry okay go ahead and tell

2229
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:32,880
us

2230
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,600
thank you thank you mr chairman uh i am

2231
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,080
from hawaii and i'm presenting on binary

2232
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:41,040
of uh quarters this rough that we have

2233
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,159
submitted

2234
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:45,040
to the second working group and uh but i

2235
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,560
think we could be interested for the

2236
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,159
observer working group as well that's

2237
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:50,159
why i'm presenting here next slides

2238
01:32:50,159 --> 01:32:52,400
please

2239
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:55,040
okay this is an eye-level overview of

2240
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,280
what are we doing and why do we need

2241
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:00,239
this model so we have uh

2242
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:02,719
i discovered from some work we have done

2243
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:04,960
with operators that inventory management

2244
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:05,679
is

2245
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:08,639
a key function in their oss system

2246
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:12,880
and today is performed through

2247
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,920
interfaces like corba xml

2248
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,000
or restful but what is missing is a

2249
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,920
standard young data model that could be

2250
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:20,880
used

2251
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,400
to retrieve the

2252
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,000
network inventory so the inventory

2253
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,239
information from the whole network

2254
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:29,280
uh through an an mbi interface of a

2255
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:32,800
network controller and the rfc 348 that

2256
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,960
we found is actually limited to the

2257
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:36,560
hardware management

2258
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:39,280
of a single device so it's not a network

2259
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,360
level model because you measure a single

2260
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,440
device and that's much more than just

2261
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,920
inventories just do the whole

2262
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,679
hardware management so what we need is

2263
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:50,000
something which is just inventory and

2264
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,480
for a network model and the intention

2265
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:55,440
that we have is to to come up with a

2266
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:58,800
model that is generic and applicable to

2267
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,280
multiple technologies including ip not

2268
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:03,360
only optical but also ip and microwave

2269
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,400
devices

2270
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,159
and that's the reason why we are asking

2271
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:08,320
a question for the first version what we

2272
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,760
are checking as the young model that we

2273
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:13,280
provide is useful is able to cope with

2274
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,800
the optical network inventory

2275
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,120
requirements but we need more work and

2276
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,120
input on what to do with the ip and

2277
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,480
microwave

2278
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:24,000
and next next slide please them

2279
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:26,320
so the key question that we need to

2280
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,800
discuss is which working group should we

2281
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,360
go for for the next steps so we with the

2282
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:34,159
economist we have an initial draft but

2283
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:36,239
we want to improve it to make it more

2284
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:38,719
generic and we would like to understand

2285
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:40,400
which are the working group so at this

2286
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,400
point we have a three candidate

2287
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,400
c camp net mod and observer working

2288
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,440
group and any other opinion is also

2289
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:48,400
welcome

2290
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:51,040
and the suggest my plan is here to

2291
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:52,880
discuss here is more where to to

2292
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,480
continue this work for the technical

2293
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,880
discussion we have a longer slot in c

2294
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,800
camp on this thursday so if you are

2295
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,600
interested to do in the technical

2296
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:03,280
discussion of the first draft please

2297
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,719
join sika but

2298
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:06,880
focus here on whether ops area or

2299
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:09,040
another working group should be

2300
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:12,480
the right place thank you

2301
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:15,480
elliot

2302
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:19,119
hi again thanks for uh taking my

2303
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:21,520
question uh italo and thanks for the

2304
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:24,719
draft um i think you have the misfortune

2305
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,360
if if my account is not wrong

2306
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,199
of being the fifth

2307
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:30,639
draft today

2308
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:33,360
to cover something relating to inventory

2309
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,199
and um

2310
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:38,639
so the word is maybe getting overused uh

2311
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:41,119
or it may be that it's being properly

2312
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:43,920
used but unfortunately with five-minute

2313
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,520
presentations it's really hard to tell

2314
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,119
so my suggestion

2315
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:48,159
is

2316
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:50,960
um that this is a good opportunity for

2317
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:53,440
an interim to bring these all to to

2318
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,360
bring a discussion around

2319
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:56,880
where all these

2320
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,480
what the map of the world looks like

2321
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,800
with regard to inventory

2322
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,280
so that we know which draft is meant to

2323
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,600
cover what purpose what drafts need to

2324
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,679
be combined whether there needs to be a

2325
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:09,679
working group for this or

2326
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:11,440
or whether it happened a new working

2327
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:12,880
group or whether it happens an existing

2328
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,719
working group some of that is for the

2329
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:18,480
iesg to decide but at least having it a

2330
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,880
healthy discussion about the map of

2331
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,320
these different drafts and where they

2332
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,960
fit together i agree with benoit we're

2333
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:25,920
we're all

2334
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,679
we're we've got a lot of inventory to

2335
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:30,880
cover as it were thank you

2336
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:33,119
okay thank you uh makes sense to me just

2337
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:34,800
to clarify this inventory of the

2338
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,800
hardware so what are the boards the

2339
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:39,600
racks the shelves and the ports

2340
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:42,239
you have deployed in the network

2341
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:44,320
i understand an inventory is overloaded

2342
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,880
terminal

2343
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:51,840
yeah it might not be a bad idea given

2344
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,119
the

2345
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:54,480
various

2346
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:57,199
maybe maybe overlap maybe not overlap to

2347
01:36:57,199 --> 01:36:59,760
to have a deeper conversation on that

2348
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,119
um

2349
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:03,840
it doesn't have a lot of time to pull

2350
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:07,840
i for one i need to uh read this one

2351
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:11,360
to get a better feel where it might go

2352
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:12,320
but

2353
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:13,440
certainly

2354
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,920
discussing or asking on the list to see

2355
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:18,239
who here in hops awg is interested

2356
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:20,400
wouldn't be a bad idea

2357
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,880
and the chairs we can talk about maybe

2358
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,480
we do want to do something to bring

2359
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,520
together

2360
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:29,360
uh marisol benoit your work

2361
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:32,320
and get more of that holistic approach

2362
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,400
to uh inventory

2363
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:35,840
well thank you for the presentation in

2364
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,960
tala thank you

2365
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:41,840
okay

2366
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:45,119
uh let's see if chin i think

2367
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:47,360
leave you and then we'll go to dan lee

2368
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:48,800
for the final

2369
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,600
presentation so this is on

2370
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:52,800
uh

2371
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,400
service attachment points

2372
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:57,920
hi

2373
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,280
can you hear me

2374
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,119
we can

2375
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:04,080
okay great uh hello everyone this is

2376
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,639
ching uh thank you chair to accommodate

2377
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:10,080
this topic as the last one and uh

2378
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:10,880
i'm

2379
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:14,480
like to present this sap network model

2380
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:17,480
next

2381
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,480
so this is another new job actually used

2382
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:22,880
to be the uni topology chapter that will

2383
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:25,679
be proceeding in the opswg and we

2384
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:28,960
actually derive from the l3 nm and l2nm

2385
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:31,199
so this model actually can work together

2386
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:34,639
with lcm and l2m to provide a close-loop

2387
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:37,520
lifecycle management for vpn service

2388
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,440
so these usa use cases has been

2389
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,679
documented in the

2390
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:44,480
opswg automation framework which you can

2391
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:46,560
publish it and

2392
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:49,119
actually we revive this ui topology

2393
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:52,320
draft because currently l3 nm lgm are

2394
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,280
stable

2395
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:55,760
so compared to the previous version we

2396
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,199
make a several

2397
01:38:57,199 --> 01:38:59,199
change actually first we haven't

2398
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:02,560
abandoned the ui topology terminology

2399
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:05,119
because this uh technology uh

2400
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:07,760
a little bit confusing because it mostly

2401
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:11,040
represents a demarcation point in online

2402
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:12,960
network between c and pe

2403
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,360
so we rename uh as sap and to uh

2404
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,199
add a clarity

2405
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:21,760
and in addition actually we clarify how

2406
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,360
this model relates to the other model

2407
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:26,560
for example t topology model nano

2408
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:27,920
topology model

2409
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:31,760
and this detail has to be uh

2410
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:34,960
can be seen in page 10 and also we

2411
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:37,360
actually make several changes first

2412
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,040
actually we

2413
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:40,960
we actually augment a

2414
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:43,600
nano topology model uh actually it is a

2415
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,639
network model with a new uh theological

2416
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:50,000
uh type list to indicate what a service

2417
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,760
type we can support for them or errors

2418
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:54,480
or vpn or nano sizing

2419
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:58,000
and we also add a service type list and

2420
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,080
a service description for each

2421
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:03,040
service attachment pawn in section

2422
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:04,480
four and six

2423
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,960
and we change the type for

2424
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,760
service attachment to the interface type

2425
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,280
because it is

2426
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,920
more reflective what it is in section

2427
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:15,440
four and six

2428
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,600
and in addition in section three we

2429
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:18,639
clarify

2430
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:21,199
one service multiple view

2431
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:22,800
and

2432
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,159
some other changes

2433
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:27,119
including reference update and we also

2434
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:30,080
add a new also vector from nokia so

2435
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,280
today i want to

2436
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:34,080
have quick discussion two uh question

2437
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,400
one is how these work together with l3

2438
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:40,000
nm how it reflected into the lsu and ltm

2439
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,480
and the other is actually written on the

2440
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:44,719
list about what is the usage example

2441
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:46,239
look like

2442
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:49,239
next

2443
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:51,920
so

2444
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:54,239
the key elements in this model is

2445
01:40:54,239 --> 01:40:56,960
sap we call the service attachment point

2446
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,400
so it is a

2447
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:01,040
general concept in the deployment of the

2448
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:03,679
network service for example vpn service

2449
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:05,520
or html service

2450
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,440
and actually this

2451
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:10,719
sap will use decide where you can attach

2452
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:13,280
or where you can deliver the service

2453
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,320
and

2454
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,320
actually this model really designed for

2455
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,800
the service orchestration layer

2456
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:21,119
so it provides a capability exposure to

2457
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:23,600
the surface oxygen layer so soviet

2458
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,040
architecture uh

2459
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:27,360
layer really want to know the capability

2460
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,280
of available end points in the

2461
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:32,800
connection resource in online networker

2462
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,880
so in the end to end the

2463
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,520
connectivity service that may span

2464
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,280
across the multiple domains so you may

2465
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:42,320
need to know uh what is the uh sequence

2466
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,239
of the domain what is the point of

2467
01:41:44,239 --> 01:41:46,719
interconnect connection to use

2468
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:49,360
so uh the the model design actually we

2469
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:54,159
augment from the network model which is

2470
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:58,080
rc8345 actually we argument with sap

2471
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,199
attribute

2472
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:01,839
next

2473
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:09,040
so how it works with lc and m actually

2474
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,320
uh

2475
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,639
as we know actually l3nm

2476
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:15,920
can be used to configure a vpn service

2477
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:19,119
and we can use this sap nano topology

2478
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:21,280
model to expose the capability so this

2479
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:23,600
can build a closed loop

2480
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:26,400
so take a l3 vpn service example so we

2481
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:29,360
can provide one vpn service but a

2482
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:31,360
multiple view for

2483
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:32,159
the

2484
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:34,960
custom view it is the first of you uh

2485
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,239
actually

2486
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:38,880
it will relate to the l3 sm and what is

2487
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,239
the custom view

2488
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:42,080
it will tell you how many sides you can

2489
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:43,600
create and

2490
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,119
in which location you can create this

2491
01:42:45,119 --> 01:42:47,760
side what a sle between the site

2492
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,280
and in addition actually it will

2493
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:52,800
translate into ls3 un actually srm

2494
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,560
will provide an

2495
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,080
actually operator view or nano

2496
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:58,159
controller view so

2497
01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:00,960
it really mean actually you can know

2498
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:03,199
where you can allocate a pe based on

2499
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:05,600
location uh selected by the customers

2500
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:06,400
and

2501
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:07,199
what

2502
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:10,560
rtid are located for the specific pe

2503
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,400
and in addition we want to provide

2504
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:15,520
another third view actually we call the

2505
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:19,040
sap view this really helps you to to

2506
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,080
know

2507
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:23,119
where you attach the service in the

2508
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:25,040
service topology on overlay topology

2509
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:26,400
where you can deliver this kind of

2510
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:27,360
service

2511
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:29,760
so what is the related

2512
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:33,520
physical interface or software interface

2513
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,679
for server interface which service

2514
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:37,840
associated with sub

2515
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:40,159
next

2516
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:43,920
so here we give a simple example

2517
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,159
actually they really

2518
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:48,159
show you for example soviet oxygen can

2519
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:51,440
send a capability query you want to look

2520
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:52,480
up some

2521
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:55,440
node capability for example take a p

2522
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:58,000
x example they really want to look up

2523
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,320
uh what service we can provide for

2524
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:03,400
specific uh interface for example

2525
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:06,639
g064 or ge06

2526
01:44:06,639 --> 01:44:07,360
for

2527
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:09,199
so you can see actually for

2528
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:10,760
uh

2529
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:13,040
g061 actually

2530
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:15,280
it's not active but it is ready to

2531
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:17,760
receive the service configuration other

2532
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,199
for the

2533
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:22,559
uh the interface

2534
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:25,679
g0464 actually it can you know support

2535
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:27,119
two separate interfaces one is

2536
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:29,119
associated with error vpn

2537
01:44:29,119 --> 01:44:32,000
the other associated with l2 vpn so we

2538
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,639
can use this model to represent this

2539
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:35,600
kind of

2540
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,760
node information and expose it to the

2541
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,840
service operation so they can build this

2542
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:40,960
uh

2543
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:44,960
automated management tool to know what a

2544
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:46,400
service project looks like where the

2545
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:48,560
service is attached so it also can be

2546
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:50,000
supported in the

2547
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,600
antenna connective service spanning

2548
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,920
across malibu domain you know where the

2549
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,840
services attach

2550
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,679
in the middle

2551
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:00,159
that's it

2552
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:03,199
next question

2553
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:05,599
comments

2554
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:10,480
there was

2555
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:12,560
adrian brought up the

2556
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:15,600
the work happening in teas in the chat

2557
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,719
and rob asked is coordination required

2558
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:20,320
it sounds like you might already be

2559
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:21,760
talking to them but it's it's an

2560
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:23,920
important point to raise are you

2561
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:26,320
are you collaborating or coordinating

2562
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:29,119
with the tease working group

2563
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:32,000
yes uh for nano slicing actually there's

2564
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,679
a design team we actually we do have uh

2565
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:37,520
actually met actually follow this

2566
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,440
activity try to align with another

2567
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,600
slicing activity aligned with the

2568
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:46,239
technology terminology yeah sure

2569
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:51,360
good uh okay so um on the working group

2570
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,880
adoption call this is something we can

2571
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:55,199
bring up uh to the list you've presented

2572
01:45:55,199 --> 01:45:56,639
this before and

2573
01:45:56,639 --> 01:45:57,920
i know this work has happened in

2574
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:00,320
conjunction with the various network

2575
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,360
models

2576
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:03,679
um so to if

2577
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:05,840
we can raise it and see what the broader

2578
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:08,000
working group feels

2579
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,560
okay thank you

2580
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,800
thank you chin

2581
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:14,880
and i think this is our last

2582
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,480
presentation

2583
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:17,520
on

2584
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:20,719
source address validation

2585
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:24,639
uh use cases and gap analysis

2586
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:27,639
so

2587
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,840
uh

2588
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:32,400
banching

2589
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:35,840
i'm a lantern team

2590
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:38,639
can you hear me

2591
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:42,080
we can oh okay

2592
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:43,520
hello everyone

2593
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,040
i'm lan chanting from chinghoy

2594
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:46,320
university

2595
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:48,400
i'm going to present

2596
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:51,360
the draft source address validation use

2597
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:55,559
cases and gap analysis

2598
01:46:56,159 --> 01:46:58,879
next one

2599
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:04,080
the traditional internet architecture

2600
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,960
lacks the validation of a package source

2601
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:10,320
address a sender can fold the source

2602
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:12,719
address when sending packets

2603
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:15,040
which is also known as source address

2604
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:16,480
spoofing

2605
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:19,600
with source address spoofing attackers

2606
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:22,639
can carry various attacks such as

2607
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:25,199
reflective ddos

2608
01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:28,080
so source address validation save

2609
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:30,000
is necessary

2610
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,560
mutually agreed norms for routine

2611
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:35,199
security manners

2612
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:38,239
is calling on network operators to

2613
01:47:38,239 --> 01:47:40,480
implement save

2614
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:41,840
however

2615
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:44,639
it's difficult to solve the source

2616
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:47,360
address spoofing problem at a single

2617
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:51,440
level or through a single save mechanism

2618
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:52,719
first

2619
01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:56,080
is unrealistic to require a sim sieve to

2620
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:59,199
be accepted by all networks

2621
01:47:59,199 --> 01:48:02,320
second the feeling of a single sieve

2622
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:06,719
mechanism will completely disable save

2623
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:07,920
okay

2624
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:10,880
next page

2625
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,560
therefore

2626
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:17,280
source address validation architecture

2627
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:20,800
server device divides sieve into three

2628
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:22,320
checking levels

2629
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:24,960
and miners also follows this

2630
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,800
architecture

2631
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:27,760
they are

2632
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:30,000
access network sieve

2633
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,840
intra-es sieve and intro esc

2634
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,000
there are many save mechanisms for

2635
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,159
different checking levels

2636
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:41,040
for the access network sieve

2637
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:44,800
survey was proposed to force each host

2638
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:48,080
to use legitimate source address

2639
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:50,480
although it provides a host level

2640
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:51,760
validation

2641
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:54,560
it's fully effective only when deployed

2642
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:57,280
by own access networks

2643
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:59,520
it's difficult to require all access

2644
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,360
network networks to deploy sally

2645
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:04,000
simultaneously

2646
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,280
so intro asc and intel esc are more

2647
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:10,159
encouraged by miners

2648
01:49:10,159 --> 01:49:12,879
next one

2649
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:17,280
the left figure shows the use cases of

2650
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:20,960
intro es and intel esc

2651
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:24,000
the four issues belong to the same

2652
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,719
customer coin and es1

2653
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:31,360
is the stock es the topology of as2 is

2654
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:34,080
presented while other asus inner

2655
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:37,760
structures are hidden for gravity

2656
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:41,199
p1 is the source address prefix of

2657
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:42,560
router 3

2658
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:47,199
p1 prime is the spoofed p1 by router 2

2659
01:49:47,199 --> 01:49:51,119
p1 double primes is the spoofed p1 by

2660
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:54,320
routers in es3

2661
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:57,679
intro esc aims to avoid spoofing from

2662
01:49:57,679 --> 01:49:59,280
inner es

2663
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:03,679
in as2 route 1 and route 4 should drop

2664
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:07,440
the package with p1 prime from router 2

2665
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:10,560
where except the package with p1 from

2666

router 3

2667

inter esc aims to avoid spoofing from

2668
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,320
external pieces

2669
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:22,159
as1 and as4 should drop the package with

2670
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:25,679
p1 double primes from es3

2671
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:28,719
while except the package with p1 from

2672
01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:30,560
es2

01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:33,280
next page

2674
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:40,960
ifch704 summarizes the recommendations

2675
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:43,760
concerning save mechanisms

2676
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:45,599
for intra-esc

2677
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:49,360
ecl business and strict uips are

2678
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:50,800
recommended

2679
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:53,199
ac air acr based receive configures

2680
01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:56,400
matching rules to specify which source

2681
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,800
prefixes are acceptable

2682
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:01,840
but it requires manual configuration to

2683
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:03,360
update

2684
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:06,960
strict uips takes the source address and

2685
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:09,599
the destination address to look up the

2686
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:11,599
field and requires the forwarding

2687
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:13,520
interface of the field

2688
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:14,560
matches

2689
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:18,480
the incoming interface of the package

2690
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:22,560
for intel es save efp urps is

2691
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:25,520
recommended to be deployed at customer

2692
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:26,960
interfaces

2693
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:30,159
it maintains a rpf list at each customer

2694
01:51:30,159 --> 01:51:32,000
interface

2695
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,840
while loose uips is recommended to be

2696
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:39,679
deployed at provider and peer interfaces

2697
01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:42,400
it only requires the source address

2698
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:44,880
appears in the field

2699
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:46,000
however

2700
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,679
existing intro and interac mechanisms

2701
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:52,639
have inherent force positive or false

2702
01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:55,440
negative problems

2703
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:57,759
next

2704
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:04,960
strictly urpf xdb is forced positive in

2705
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:06,800
the case of routing

2706
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:08,800
asymmetry

2707
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:12,960
the left figure shows an example

2708
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:16,480
the access network owns a prefix

2709
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:18,639
due to traffic policy

2710
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:21,119
it splits the prefix into two

2711
01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:22,960
sub-prefixes

2712
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:26,080
it advertises one sub-prefix to router

2713
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:29,760
one and the other to router two

2714
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:32,480
when router 3 forwards package to

2715
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:35,480
10.1.0.0.16

2716
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:40,880
the forwarding path is router 3 router 4

2717
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:44,639
router 2 and access network the reverse

2718
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:48,239
path is access network route 1 and

2719
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:49,760
router 3.

2720
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:53,360
when router 3 runs strict uips

2721
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:56,480
the save rule is packaged with source

2722
01:52:56,480 --> 01:53:00,280
addresses of 10.1.0.0.16

2723
01:53:01,119 --> 01:53:03,679
must arrive from router 4

2724
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:07,520
so the reverse data flow will be dropped

2725
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:11,679
in general existing intro esc mechanism

2726
01:53:11,679 --> 01:53:15,599
has forced positive problems

2727
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:18,400
next page

2728
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:23,199
for inter escape mechanisms

2729
01:53:23,199 --> 01:53:26,719
efp urps and the loose urpf have

2730
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:29,599
inherited force negative problems

2731
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:33,040
we take as4 as an example

2732
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:38,320
as5 is its provider s3 is experienced

2733
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:42,480
as1 and s2 are its customers

2734
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:46,719
when s4 runs efp uips

2735
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:49,040
at customer interfaces

2736
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:51,280
the same rule is

2737
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:53,760
packaged with source addresses belonging

2738
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:57,199
to es4's customer code can arrive from

2739
01:53:57,199 --> 01:53:58,800
every customer

2740
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:02,560
so it says in es4 customer coin converts

2741
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:04,480
each other

2742
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:07,520
when as4 runs lose

2743
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:10,480
at provider and peer interfaces

2744
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:13,520
the received rule is packaged with any

2745
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:16,480
source addresses existing field can

2746
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:19,679
arrive from every provider appear

2747
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:23,199
so this is outside es4's customer coin

2748
01:54:23,199 --> 01:54:26,719
converts any source addressing fee

2749
01:54:26,719 --> 01:54:28,239
in general

2750
01:54:28,239 --> 01:54:31,520
existing inter afc mechanisms have

2751
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:34,560
forced negative problems

2752
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:37,840
next page

2753
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:42,480
an ideal save mechanism should guarantee

2754
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:43,920
accuracy

2755
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:46,960
because force positives cause

2756
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:50,080
traffic disruption while false negatives

2757
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:52,800
give attackers the freedom to forge

2758
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:55,119
source addresses

2759
01:54:55,119 --> 01:54:56,480
however

2760
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:59,119
as aforementioned existing save

2761
01:54:59,119 --> 01:55:03,040
mechanisms cannot guarantee accuracy

2762
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:06,639
the root cause of their inca inaccuracy

2763
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:10,800
is that they are achieved based on local

2764
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:13,599
fib or rib information

2765
01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:16,159
which may not match the real detail

2766
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:20,239
forwarding path from other sources

next page

2768
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:27,679
in order to avoid false positives and

2769
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:30,239
reduce false negatives as much as

2770
01:55:30,239 --> 01:55:32,960
possible save should follow the real

2771
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:35,119
data forwarding path

2772
01:55:35,119 --> 01:55:38,159
to this end a path probing method can be

2773
01:55:38,159 --> 01:55:39,199
taken

2774
01:55:39,199 --> 01:55:40,320
that is

2775
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:43,360
the source router sends probing packets

2776
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:45,760
carrying source information

2777
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:48,560
then each intermediate router can

2778
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:51,199
generate safe rules based on source

2779
01:55:51,199 --> 01:55:54,560
information and the incoming interface

2780
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:57,840
more specifically when interfaces cannot

2781
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:00,560
learn complete forwarding information a

2782
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:03,199
combination of allow list and the block

2783
01:56:03,199 --> 01:56:06,639
list can improve the accuracy

2784
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:08,080
besides

2785
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:11,119
design designing a practical probing

2786
01:56:11,119 --> 01:56:13,920
method needs to consider many practical

2787
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:15,040
issues

2788
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:17,840
such as high skill ability

2789
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:20,560
the design should not induce much

2790
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:21,840
overhead

2791
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:25,119
and high deplorability the design should

2792
01:56:25,119 --> 01:56:27,599
get generate seal table automatically

2793
01:56:27,599 --> 01:56:31,199
and support incremental deployment

2794
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:33,119
the high security

2795
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:35,840
the design should guarantee the

2796
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:40,400
integrity of each probing package

next page

2798
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:45,199
so

2799
01:56:45,199 --> 01:56:47,679
we are to promote this work

2800
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:49,199
we have three

2801
01:56:49,199 --> 01:56:50,639
candidates

2802
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:52,400
into area

2803
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:55,599
since sawa and savvy are adopted by

2804
01:56:55,599 --> 01:56:57,040
inter area

2805
01:56:57,040 --> 01:56:58,560
rtg

2806
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:02,800
because intro asc and the intro asc are

2807
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,719
related to routine

2808
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:06,080
opsec

2809
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:10,320
since efp urpf is adopted by opi sec or

2810
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:12,080
others

2811
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:15,920
we sincerely said comments to refine our

2812
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:17,280
draft

2813
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:18,800
and seek

2814
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:20,800
collaborators

2815
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:24,800
thanks any question or comment

2816
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:28,320
uh we are out of time lynching and i i

2817
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:30,239
adrian mentioned that when you discuss

2818
01:57:30,239 --> 01:57:33,599
this in um interior the recommendation

2819
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:35,760
was to discuss with opsec which i think

2820
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:36,960
makes sense

2821
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:38,400
so i

2822
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:41,280
i would suggest bringing it up

2823
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:45,119
over there would be a good next step

2824
01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:47,119
okay thank you

2825
01:57:47,119 --> 01:57:51,040
thanks and well with that we are

2826
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:53,599
just about two minutes remaining

2827
01:57:53,599 --> 01:57:55,760
um i don't know warren rob if you want

2828
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:58,000
to say any parting words

2829
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,119
uh

2830
01:57:59,119 --> 01:58:01,760
and then we can let everyone go

2831
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:03,360
yep i guess i'll quickly just say

2832
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:06,320
something so first off thanks again to

2833
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:09,360
the ops awg chairs for

2834
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:11,760
you know doing this and

2835
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:14,400
um we let them have the extra time

2836
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:16,159
if anybody would like to come and talk

2837
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:18,719
to robert about any ops area stuff we

2838
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:21,840
will both be looking in gather town

2839
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:23,920
so um you know that will be basically

2840
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:26,639
our equivalent of the normal

2841
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:28,400
ops area open mic

2842
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:30,480
so see you all there if you would like

2843
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:34,280
to come along and chat with us

2844
01:58:34,719 --> 01:58:36,960
thank you everyone have a great rest of

2845
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:41,040
ietf 112 and a great rest of your day

2846
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:46,199
however long is left thank you very much

2847
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:53,880
thanks everybody for attending bye
