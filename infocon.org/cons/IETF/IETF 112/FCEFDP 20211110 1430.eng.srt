1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,160
you can

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,040
take minutes uh

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,639
let's see here wes can i hit you up for

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,799
that

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,880
didn't he already do that

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,880
yeah

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,840
but i think he might be tied up for the

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,720
moment or actually maybe i'll hit up rob

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,160
rob wilton do you mind taking some

10

minutes for us

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,960
i can only do it for about half an hour

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,760
because then i've got to drop for

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,200
another meeting so i don't mind doing

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,320

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,640

because

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,879

26
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,760

and um

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,439
wes as you can see as you can see if you

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,320
go to the the webpage for the program

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,200
we are in the final stretch which is why

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,280
you see this wonderfully animated gif

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,079
here

38
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,520
um i don't know if we'll finish

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,880
everything today

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,880
uh brian and i have been talking we

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,200
think if we can great if we can finish

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,040
stuff on list great

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,680
otherwise it is distinctly possible that

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,520
we might need one more interim but we're

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,680
really hoping not we'll see by the end

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,200
of the meeting

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,159
um

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,840
so for that to happen we're asking

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,840

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,200

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,079
but obviously if you feel you need to

53
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,000
make a comment please do

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,799
uh

55
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,719
as we've been doing this the last few

56
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,880
times brian will be managing the queue

57
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,360
uh in terms of who's talking um and uh

58
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,160
we'll be uh going to them to to github

59
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,360
for uh specific issues when we need to

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
and um

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,440
that's where we keep our issues list so

62
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,520
without further ado

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,319
um

64
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,959
the notewell we we have used to apply

65
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:23,920
here

66
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,120
um

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,000
uh i think everybody has been seeing um

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,360
the the extended notewells in various uh

69
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,400
meetings

70
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,920
um i wanna stress that our

71
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,080
anti-harassment procedures are part of

72
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,840
this list and we

73
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,599
when when we say really note well we are

74
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,280
asking everybody to

75
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,120
to put their best

76
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,519
foot forward this is a contentious

77
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,239
discussion people can get heated um just

78
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,160
to remember that everybody here is is

79
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,440
working the best interest of the

80
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,480
internet

81
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,440
um

82
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,000
i see wes you you have a question please

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,280
please

84
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,760
or comment um i don't see rich logged

85
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,080
into the editor so it would be good to

86
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,560
verify that he is actually here

87
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,200
otherwise rob and i can take over but or

88
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,720
maybe he's taking notes somewhere else

89
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,879
but rich there you are

90
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,000

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,599
posted in chat

92
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,399

93
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,159
okay um three people online and the one

94
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,959

95
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,640
duck are we in two different note

96
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,360
sections again

97
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,040
okay um

98
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,640
just use the let

99
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,480
let's use the one that rich is using

100
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,319
just because he started that and that

101
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,760
just makes sure that people follow

102
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,560
through

103
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,159
and if you guys can communicate out of

104
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,799
band um to proceed

105
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,280
um sam

106
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,920
sam do you have a question or comment

107
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,159
okay

108
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,840
okay all right so um here we are at no

109
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,959
well um and i think we can all say that

110
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,120
we have noted well

111
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,000
our agenda um we have noted well

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,159
we propose to do very quick bits of

113
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,200
bashing

114
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,480
um i want to just go over the timeline

115
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,080
very quickly it's changed ever so

116
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,599
slightly i don't propose to take any

117
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,279
comments on it because the rest of the

118
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,519
timeline is likely to be based on how we

119
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,440
do in this meeting and then uh it's up

120
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,800
to the iab

121
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,880
uh from there um

122
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,759
we are offering uh the the q a from the

123
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,320
community because we put out a note

124
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,400
saying that we would take q a in this

125
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,199
meeting uh from the community uh for

126
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,360
people who have not been participating

127
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,320
um

128
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,680
we're not going to take a lot of that

129
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,800
because we want to try and get through

130
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,440
the issues but we invite anybody

131
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,840
to ask questions on list at any time or

132
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,280
you can ask the chairs if you want

133
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,000
background feel free to contact us in

134
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,960
any way

135
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
then um we'll get right into issues

136
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,000
we're going to do that for about 40

137
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,240
minutes and then we're going to be done

138
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,600
any questions about the agenda

139
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,039
okay

140
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,840
so uh this is an update of the slide

141
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,919
from last time

142
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,800
the times have shifted a little bit

143
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,360
excuse me i'm just getting over cold

144
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,560
um

145
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,919
the uh

146
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,240
the good news is uh

147
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,199
that

148
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,240
the

149
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,520
draft carpenter rcib

150
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,919
charter was dispatched

151
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,320
um at least i believe it was dispatched

152
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,120
and so was the 2026

153
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120
update that brian did that was also

154
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,639
dispatched

155
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,560
uh lars has agreed that he would take

156
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,240
that otherwise obviously all that has to

157
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,800
be confirmed on the mailing lists but it

158
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
all sort of looks good

159
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,919
um

160
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,720
we are hoping assuming uh so we will

161
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,120
absolutely need a new version of the the

162
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,960
draft um

163
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
peter and brian and i will be going

164
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,800
through the results of this meeting as

165
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,120
well as the editorials early next week

166
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,560
and hopefully we'll get a draft out

167
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,479
shortly thereafter

168
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,360
um

169
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,639
then uh

170
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,160
we're hoping and this is sort of a

171
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,319
finger in the wind just our guess as to

172
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,479
when the iab can can begin this

173
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,400
they have a process that's governed by

174
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,720
rfc 4845

175
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,680
that starts the broader community review

176
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,479
um and then at the same time

177
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,720
we hope that the other documents can be

178
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,240
uh developed

179
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,720
uh um

180
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,039
the uh hopefully based on any comments

181
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,240
received from community review if you

182
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,600
have to make some changes make some

183
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,160
changes but otherwise uh allow for the

184
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,759
iab to do its approval by the end of

185
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,960
january

186
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,759
and then we still begin formation of the

187
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,199
r7 rswg

188
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,319
at shortly thereafter and the iesg will

189
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,680
have to the approval of the two

190
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,759
documents that got dispatched as well as

191
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,240
i think uh rich also has a document

192
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,440
uh that is covered uh for uh for 2028

193
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,840
bis which is also being worked on

194
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,000
um so then that's sort of where we're

195
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,639
hoping but all of this assumes no more

196
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,560
substantial issues and further that

197
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,160
we're able to resolve what substantial

198
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,759
issues that we have

199
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,680
um if you have comments about this this

200
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,240
is just mostly a finger in the wind

201
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,759
but sort of where i expect things to go

202
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,319
it's i'd like not to discuss that now

203
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,080
but rather you know if you have issues

204
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,280
with this please just take it to the

205
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,080
list um again mostly most of this is

206
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,880
prognostication not um

207
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,160
not something that is in any way

208
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,639
normative okay

209
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,680
um

210
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,400
moving on uh this is really a little bit

211
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,960
of time set aside in as a priority for

212
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,240
those people who haven't been

213
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,000
participating

214
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,560
if you have read the draft in particular

215
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,800
and you have questions

216
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,879
please if if

217
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,000
in informational questions in particular

218
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,039
please if you would join the queue

219
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,240
um

220
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,400
and uh

221
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,800
see if uh and we'll see if we can get

222
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,560
some questions answered

223
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,840
um

224
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,599
and if people do not join the queue in

225
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,440
about in about 30 seconds then we'll

226
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,199
just press on to issues and if we have

227
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,599
time at the end we take more questions

228
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,599
then

229
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,039
because that just means more time to

230
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,680
allow us to process through issues

231
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,000
which is fine because i think we're all

232
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,680
racing towards that finish line at this

233
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,919
point

234
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,280
all right um

235
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,879
barring

236
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,319
obviously the community is going to get

237
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,520
a formal

238
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,519
um opportunity to uh raise uh questions

239
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,519
when we go through the the community

240
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,000
reviews the iab process so there's still

241
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,360
time

242
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,000
for for things to come up

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,040
and there has been time our uh

244
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,680
our program last call just completed

245
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,160
um i want to thank everybody

246
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,480
who contributed and a lot of people did

247
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,839
contribute

248
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:56,959
um

249
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,959
one might say well

250
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,399
sadly we have a lot of issues to get

251
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,560
through um but the good news is we've

252
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,720
been able to bucket those and maybe we

253
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,480
can move forward with a certain amount

254
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,760
of alacrity

255
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,000
now when i say alacrity though um

256
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,880
anybody is invited to join the queue and

257
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,480
say hey wait a minute

258
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,440
um i want to i have a comment about this

259
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,480
issue

260
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,600
um what i'm going to do is i'm going to

261
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
put forward the stack of slides that we

262
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,640
have

263
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,120
um show how we bucketed things

264
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,720
and then we'll step through each of

265
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
those slides individually

266
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,279
and if you have questions or comments

267
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,320
please

268
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,560
feel free to um

269
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,680
to to to provide your views

270
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
um okay

271
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,800
so

272
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,880
now i have to get this on so this i'm

273
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,720
going to try and make it bigger on my

274
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,480
side so people can see a little better

275
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,200
on their side whoa

276
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,040
let me just see if i do this does it

277
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,200
even help more

278
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,920
um let's hear these are a bit of an eye

279
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,080
chart i apologize for that

280
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,200
um

281
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,880
i'm just gonna see if i can zoom this a

282
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,079
bit more

283
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,479
is that better

284
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,200
let's hope that it is so how don't you

285
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,279
just get the first presentation though

286
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,440
yeah good presentation though if i throw

287
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,920
it into presentation mode i i sort of

288
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,560
lose other views but let's try that see

289
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,480
that works better can people see the

290
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,000
presentation mode are they seeing the

291
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,480
other mode

292
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,000
oops sorry so these are the buckets if

293
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,560
you uploaded the slides and converted

294
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,079
them you can actually use the other

295
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,440
button there which is not sharing your

296
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,959
screen but sharing the slides directly

297
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,120
that makes it much easier for you

298
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,800
well i think for the moment let's just

299
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,560
go with this just i think everybody can

300
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,839
see

301
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,959
um

302
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,880
so the first there are mostly editorial

303
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,240
issues i'm going to come back to this

304
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,079
slide you can see we have a good number

305
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,600
of them and i'll explain each of these

306
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,760
issues briefly

307
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,440
the second is where i think we have

308
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,040
agreement

309
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,560
um and there's a good number of issues

310
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,240
here i mean look at this nice stack

311
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
issues where i think i think we do have

312
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,040
agreement of course the the obviously

313
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,360
though they assume my assumption here is

314
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,839
that that that we'll accept these but of

315
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,980
course if you disagree um

316
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,440
[Music]

317
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,279
uh we'll uh we'll spend a little more

318
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,360
time then we have things where we didn't

319
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,880
hear a lot of support i want to spend a

320
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,399
little more time on this to give those

321
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,680
people who raised these issues the

322
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,760
opportunity to speak if they'd like to

323
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,440
do so but i'd like them again to be

324
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,720
brief

325
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,320
um and then there were some areas where

326
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,079
we clearly have to have a bit more

327
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,480
discussion

328
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,880
excuse me um

329
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,480
the uh the first issues are 93 and 94

330
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,000
which were proposed by martin thank you

331
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,320
for staying up late martin to to engage

332
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,839
in the discussion

333
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:40,800
um

334
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,720
one is about uh

335
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,360
what uh appeals against rs rsap

336
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,320
decisions in one case uh the

337
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,399
we've said really it's process only but

338
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,440
maybe

339
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,200
we need to vary that slightly we'll get

340
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
into more detail there and another um

341
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,959
it's about um

342
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,000
uh

343
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,920
how how resolutions are happening uh

344
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,120
what happened when they're a timely

345
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,480
manner it's a slight uh that's a bit of

346
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,680
a tweak of the text and we'll go through

347
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,560
that

348
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,480
um we've seen a lot of discussions about

349
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,399
statements and about also you know who

350
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,639
controls the website and things like

351
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,279
that that's really issue 117.

352
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,639
um and then uh there's the who controls

353
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,519
uh

354
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,959
the last call so those are sort of the

355
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,240
big ones that i think we need to spend a

356
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,760
lot more time on

357
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,800
so those are the grouped issues and i'd

358
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,079
like now to back up to this

359
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,800
and just ask so so let me step through

360
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,200
each of these and i'll talk to them

361
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,490
you can follow along in github

362
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,720
[Music]

363
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,959
in terms of the issue number to see the

364
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,200
exact edits

365
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,079
um and let's start

366
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,479
i'm sorry

367
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,360
no okay

368
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,200
okay so in

369
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,920
issue number 106

370
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,040
myria has proposed a concise a more

371
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,720
concise statement

372
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,399
for um

373
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,959
uh the the beginning of the abstract

374
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,480
that this i think it's something like

375
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,560
this specifies the version three of the

376
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,040
rc editor model and these

377
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,200
uh editorial in these editorial issues i

378
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,320
propose that on the whole you trust that

379
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,880
peter will take your

380
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,440
uh concerns into account

381
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,240
um and so long as we're not modifying

382
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,160
normative intent of

383
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,920
uh the process that we've gone through

384
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,240
over the last 18 months

385
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,320
trust that he will do the right thing

386
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,800
in terms of of being concise and things

387
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,639
like that and using the language where

388
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,240
appropriate

389
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,279
um

390
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,800
and if you see something you don't like

391
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,560
when the update comes out of course you

392
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
could say something

393
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,440
um

394
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,000
so then uh the other issue that i think

395
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,079
miriam raised was what are the actual

396
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,120
updates to certain other rfcs and uh uh

397
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
muriel is very specific

398
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,959
uh be a little more clear on what has

399
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,040
changed and usually we do

400
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,279
mention uh some particularly when there

401
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,680
are updates we do mention the

402
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,279
it's become a bit of a tradition to at

403
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,120
least mention that either in the

404
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,399
abstract but more likely in the

405
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,240
beginning in the introduction somewhere

406
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,720
to say here's what has changed in at the

407
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,920
highest level um not not in great detail

408
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,160
but at the highest level usually the

409
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,959
words are put in the introduction

410
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,160
uh there is a bit of discussion now

411
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,720
around uh consistency around how

412
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,519
selection committees were formed um

413
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,399
the

414
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,639
initial proposals was just to make this

415
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,360
language the same but just as

416
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,959
uh we were getting ready for this

417
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,639
meeting i saw a note from jay saying

418
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,160
wait a minute i think these two should

419
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,440
be separate

420
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,959
so i'd like to

421
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,440
let's pile this one back into

422
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,800
the discuss

423
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,440
column uh uh and we'll let let's come

424
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,760
back to issue number 111 a little bit

425
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,279
later

426
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,880
um

427
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,800
the rpc sow this was just a slight

428
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,440
editing and of of

429
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,839
um how that uh how that issue should be

430
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,199
dealt with

431
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,720
um

432
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,519
then um issue 121

433
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,720
um

434
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,639
this was uh

435
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,480
this is just a header change at this

436
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,959
point initially this wasn't an editorial

437
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,199
issue it was uh uh

438
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,040
it was miria saying we haven't really

439
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,120
addressed incoming but we actually did

440
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,399
in one of the

441
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,199
uh interim decide to not address uh

442
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,839
outgoing i'm sorry we haven't addressed

443
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,160
outgoing outreach and we decided one of

444
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,440
the interims that we weren't going to do

445
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,160
that

446
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,480
but the title of the section needs to

447
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,000
change

448
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,360
um issue number 122

449
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,639
was is a slight wording change uh to

450
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,199
which i i viewed as editorial which just

451
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,519
is to refer to the rpc as being

452
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,480
uh

453
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,120
as contractually overseen

454
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,560
um

455
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,680
then uh issue number 124

456
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,959
is minor tweet to cover legacy editor uh

457
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,440
rfc editor document that's to say

458
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,639
um

459
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,079
that uh

460
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,680
you can still use the the the the the rc

461
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,519
editor documents that we had before

462
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,680
still apply unless we have specifically

463
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,199
said that they don't

464
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,199
right and that they can then be updated

465
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,000
later if needs be and mike provided some

466
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,320
some good wording along these lines

467
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,519
um and that's just for continuity's sake

468
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,480
um

469
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,199
120 126 uh the this is um

470
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,519
another one which was point in time rpc

471
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,199
responsibilities and literally it says

472
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,800
something like as of

473
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,160
you know now or something like that and

474
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,880
there's wording again there

475
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,000
then uh issue number 130 was from ecker

476
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,720
um and this was uh we really do want to

477
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,480
be normative about this i think he's

478
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,800
he's probably correct and then um so

479
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,959
we're leaving it to peter to say

480
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,040
uh chooses or shall choose and then in

481
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,720
the discussion it came out and this is a

482
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,480
little bit of a discussion

483
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,639
uh do we need references to to the

484
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,519
appropriate normative language rfcs uh

485
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,120
2119

486
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,959
8171

487
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,280
and i think since we are using xiao uh

488
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,559
all over the place

489
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,640
uh it seems to me like it doesn't hurt

490
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,720
to to to do so

491
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,559
but again i would just leave that to

492
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,160
peter to decide unless somebody has a

493
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,039
really strong opinion about it

494
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,760
um then uh also eckerd pointed out

495
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,119
really we should be

496
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,480
more normally referencing 20 of 2418

497
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,640
rather than

498
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,280
7282

499
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,160
in terms of process management um

500
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,640
ecker's particular concern is that 7282

501
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,720
is an informational document

502
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,440
um versus uh 2018 which is really the

503
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,160
normative way in which we

504
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,640
manage working groups

505
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,360
and then finally eckerd uh helped us be

506
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,679
concise a member of community is a

507
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,320
person so we could just use that phrase

508
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,400
um and so these i'm going to suggest to

509
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,320
peter you know please take these into

519
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,240
please please feel free to say wait a

520
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,840
minute i'd like to

521
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,120
uh

522
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,080
like us to review this a little bit more

523
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,640
um all right then we have

524
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,160
uh issues

525
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,640
that um

526
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,120
we uh we we we should accept one of them

527
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,200
it was really an editorial i put it in

528
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,559
the wrong column this is just add a

529
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,559
reference to draft carpenter that's

530
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,280
actually in the working copy already

531
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,960
um

532
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,120
and then so here i am expecting at least

533
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,600
some people to say okay to ask questions

534
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,120
if you have questions so please do feel

535
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,120
free um

536
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,720
and i do want to share at least a little

537
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,880
bit of github language here and there uh

538
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,280
when it when it's appropriate um jay

539
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,760
made a proposal to allow for a temporary

540
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,720
uh

541
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,280
rce to be appointed

542
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
and i gave some examples

543
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,200
about you know why that might be

544
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,919
appropriate at different times

545
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,280
my proposal i didn't hear any objections

546
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,799
and i think

547
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,320
martin i think you asked a question or

548
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
two about it i didn't see any any

549
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,200
further concerns if people have concerns

550
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,679
about uh that that language you know

551
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,960
please feel free to say so

552
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,960
let's see here uh rpc responsibilities

553
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,799
missing a couple of responsibilities and

554
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,039
jay elaborated those

555
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,600
um and those are specif uh and they're

556
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,280
not in particular

557
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,760
uh i didn't see any concerns raised on

558
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
the list about that seem to have some

559
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,520
support

560
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,280
um

561
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,360
the earlier deck of

562
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,000
this slide said i didn't see a lot of

563
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,559
support to remove the word ultimate and

564
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,840
everybody came back to me and said oh

565
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,760
yes you do

566
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,280
so

567
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,039
we should remove the word uh ultimate

568
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,400
when it comes to ultimate authority of

569
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,559
the llc

570
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,919
um

571
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,720
uh issue number 109 was uh if we're

572
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,120
going to hard code rfc interest maybe we

573
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,799
need a slight wording tweak which brian

574
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,480
carpenter then proposed

575
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,600
which was rfc interest or the equivalent

576
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,200
if people would like to make other

577
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,600
changes please feel free

578
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,200
um

579
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,600
this is a certain a simpler process for

580
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,200
certain changes

581
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,720
let's go to so 114 117

582
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,960
and 128 are all sort of wrapped up in

583
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,919
one

584
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,520
and i'm going to go to the text for that

585
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,640
in a minute

586
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,960
and i'll go to the text for um

587
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,960
heritage this is an issue raised by

588
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,559
stephen farrell

589
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,679
um so let's go to 114

590
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,280
just a moment

591
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,360
i'm going to share with different

592
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,918
i'm going to share another second here

593
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,280
let's

594
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,039
find the sharing button again

595
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,440
and then we're just going to share

596
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,480
my whole screen

597
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,840
let's try this

598
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,799
okay and now i see i shared this this is

599
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,400
screen one i think i need to share

600
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,320
screen two

601
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,919
yes okay

602
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,840
allow

603
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,200
okay now this is issue 114

604
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,120
right which was raised by

605
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,360
john clanson

606
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,480
and so

607
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,640
in this we are talking about several

608
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,480
different things

609
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,880
um and between issues 114 117 and 128

610
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,600
we're talking about three things

611
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,880
thing number one is whether the rsce had

612
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,720
to wait to ask to be asked a question

613
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,760
um

614
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,720
and so

615
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,159
this would be the equivalent of saying

616
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,600
well you know that there's a train

617
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,440
coming down the tunnel but the rsce

618
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,799
couldn't warn us

619
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,400
and i don't think that was our intent

620
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,960
and the proposal the pro proposed edits

621
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,280
for that text are to basically say well

622
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,000
the rfc rce can of course advise us if

623
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,159
they see a train coming down the tunnel

624
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,880
and the actual specific change for that

625
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,600
can be found in issue 128

626
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,850
and then um

627
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,120
[Music]

628
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,320
so this other issue this issue in 117

629
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,640
has to do with who controls

630
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,000
the website

631
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,520
um

632
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,480
the there is actually no text here yet

633
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,760
for that

634
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,440
and we'll talk about that in issue 117.

635
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,919
um the text here the only except issue

636
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,840
here was for the rsce text which it

637
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,200
turns out it was wasn't 128.

638
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,640
um

639
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,080
and we'll come back to this when we get

640
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,320
to 117.

641
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,200
then

642
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,080
um

643
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,720
just a moment

644
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,120
issue 119

645
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,760
so stephen and others raised concerns

646
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,360
about

647
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,200
the heritage and whether that should be

648
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
taken into account

649
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,960
in terms of how the rswg and rsap do

650
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,440
their deliberations

651
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,919
and in the discussion i think what we

652
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,039
found

653
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,520
was that the word heritage

654
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,799
uh became a um

655
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,520
a very uh difficult term

656
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,880
to use

657
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,799
um and so as i propose some text

658
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:39,760
which is

659
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,679
around this

660
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,880
which says that

661
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,520
rather than using the term uh heritage

662
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,200
but simply uh to add an addition to what

663
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,720
was there which this part was here

664
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,919
already

665
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:52,300
um

666
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,320
[Music]

667
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,159
this is the edition

668
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,960
which was proposed really

669
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,480
it's readable like i can't read them

670
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,720
mike

671
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,559
okay hang on a second

672
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,960
is let me just make it bigger is that

673
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,679

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,600
stuff this is

679
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,480
sort of a reasonable amount of

680
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,240
motherhood but i don't think it captures

681
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,559
what stephen had in mind nor for my for

682
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,320
that matter what my but i had in mind

683
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,720
basically i'm looking at

684
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,200
something to cover

685
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,919
availability accessibility publication

686
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,080
language commonality of purpose

687
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,679
diversity of interest breadth of

688
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,960
expression

689
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,039
archival quality and world-class

690
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,039
professional publication

691
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,279
as sort of the base principles on what

692
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,520
we're on where we're building from

693
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,679
going forward the things the things that

694
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,120
we don't want to throw out with bath

695
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
water if you will

696
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,919
some of this was expressed in bob's last

697
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,240
report on the rrc series

698
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,720
um some of it has been

699
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,799
you know well understood if not

700
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,120
expressed in text

701
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,240
um

702
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,480
or has been you know traveled about in

703
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,960
various conversations i'm sorry for the

704
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,559
delay it's just

705
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,559
you know

706
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,120
taking time to get things written or or

707
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,760
steal the right text

708
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,799
ecker

709
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,320
i'd really be happy to see some text

710
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,080
here but the way mike first phrase that

711
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,440
is not something that i'm excited about

712
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,279
seeing um i think that a number of those

713
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,480
points are contested and that like the

714
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,720
text here i believe has has in fact

715
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,400
almost too much but like has the right

716
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,520
sort of like everybody can form their

717
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,799
own opinion about like what is good and

718
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,559
what is bad but like

719
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,520
like i don't want to spend the next

720
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,880
three months fighting about like all the

721
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,520
words mike just said

722
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,679
which i think are in fact you know like

723
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,000
like like the the many of those words

724
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,279
have been disabled precisely debates

725
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,000
that like that like led to the situation

726
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,600
buried down so

727
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,240
okay christian

728
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,480
excuse me

729
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,760
enough i'm with eco on this one

730
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,679
there are principles that have assured

731
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,080
the success of the series

732
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,880
but

733
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,880
uh unless we can point to an existing

734
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
document

735
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,400
something that was written by john

736
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,159
poster some time ago or something like

737
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,120
that

738
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,960
then i don't think that we should take

739
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
on the task of

740
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,400
actually in making an inventory

741
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,159
and a list of those principles and

742
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,840
defining what they are

743
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,279
in this document

744
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,440
if only for practical reason if we try

745
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,360
doing that we are going to spend

746
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
another three months arguing between

747
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,959
ourselves and we don't need that

748
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,520
mike

749
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,080
yeah the problem with that is john

750
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,840
didn't feel the need to break the stuff

751
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,080
down because it was sort of a

752
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,600
common

753
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,919
uh common mindset of everybody at the

754
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,679
time this is the way things were gonna

755
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:14,720
go

756
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,240
now i'm

757
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,080
sure we could probably grab john

758
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,039
clemson's to steve crocker

759
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,279
uh

760
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,960
bob hinden

761
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,159
um

762
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,760
scott bradner

763
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,440
and say okay

764
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,919
what what was in john's mind and get a

765
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,679
pretty good idea of that but then you

766
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,279
would be basically saying well you know

767
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,279
that's your opinion

768
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,960
i think there's things here that we need

769
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,679
to basically capture and i think it's

770
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,120
important that we that well for example

771
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,480
um our does the does the rswg get to

772
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,240
change the language of the series from

773
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,360
english to something else

774
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,039
so uh mike let me ask a question to you

775
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,880
is this a guardrail that you feel

776
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,520
strongly needs to be in this document or

777
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,760
is this something that the rswg itself

778
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,679
could take up and if it went into this

779
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,760
document one reasonable question to ask

780
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,559
is why couldn't the rs could the rswd

781
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,480
change it

782
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,640
no this this is one one of the things

783
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,480
here is to put the language in that

784
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,240
basically says that these are things

785
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,360
that require going outside the comfort

786
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,840
zone of the rswg and the rsab

787
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,399
back to the original delegators to the

788
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,360
iab iesg and llc

789
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,000
to say you know we want to change this

790
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,880
we the guardrails are put in place

791
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,360
in meta language um

792
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,080
and

793
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,880
yeah we don't want and everybody here

794
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,720
wants to change something

795
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,720
and i have the suspicion we're going to

796
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,200
be arguing about this for a while

797
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,520
um okay the

798
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,000
i look at i look at it this way

799
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,240
we have spent a long time trying to get

800
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,840
to the point of constraining the rswg to

801
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,679
a particular set of things and it keeps

802
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,360
getting expanded again

803
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,559
i really prefer that we

804
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,640
lock them in their box of writing

805
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,240
documents

806
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,559
and

807
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,640
say something about what those documents

808
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,360
are

809
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,679
as opposed to just sort of saying

810
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,679
no you can we're we're going to lock you

811
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,679
in the box and then you can write a

812
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,520
document that unlocks a box and let

813
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,039
yourself out again

814
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,440
after we've spent a year and a half or

815
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,360
two years at this

816
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,840
not a lot of fun

817
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,000
peter i think

818
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,840
before we go further i just want to ask

819
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,360
the questions does

820
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,520
if are there those who agree with mike

821
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,840
on this point if we could hear from

822
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,120
those people

823
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,640
otherwise i'd like to hear from others

824
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,799
who agree from mike on the list because

825
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,399
we need to have some more support for

826
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,720
that view i think at this point but if

827
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
you're if you're in the queue to support

828
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,760
mike please remain in the queue if not

829
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,640
i'd like to hear from from from others

830
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,000
who would support my comment

831
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,719
peter

832
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,360
yeah i did um include texts from 87 28

833
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,120
and 87 29

834
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,840
um which you know are approved rfcs and

835
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,799
all that

836
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,799
that um

837
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,880
addresses some of the principles and

838
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,399
those principles are expressed in those

839
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,960
rfcs about the rfc editor

840
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,159
function and so on so personally with my

841
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,320
editor hat on i think that's enough for

842
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,200
now

843
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,640
and

844
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,039
things that are coming from elsewhere or

845
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,240
you know

846
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,360
a process by whereby we interview folks

847
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,840
who were there with john postel and

848
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,520
things like that i don't think that's a

849
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,000
good idea at this point if we want to

850
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,399
take on some document about principles

851
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,000
of the rfc series once the rswg is set

852
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,799
up

853
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,880
that's fine and that group can decide to

854
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,399
take that on as a working group item

855
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,720
thanks

856
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,600
eric

857
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,799
oh no joel sorry joel

858
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,760
joel are you gonna

859
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,320
gonna speak

860
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,120
didn't hear the request because i came

861
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,279
in when my system was just temporarily

862
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,799
dropping audio sorry um

863
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,720
i philosophically agree with mike i

864
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,240
don't know that i will agree with all of

865
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,320
the things he writes down

866
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,000
but i think

867
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,240
that it is important that we actually go

868
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,159
through the argument

869
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,799
as to what principles we think are

870
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,640
important to have as

871
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,760
base things that the rswg just doesn't

872
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,240
get to just change by itself

873
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,799
and maybe it probably it's a smaller set

874
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,240
than i would like

875
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,440
but

876
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,279
if it is an empty set

877
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,240
then

878
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,320
most of the work we've done has probably

879
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,039
been a waste of time

880
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,360
so i i philosophically agree with mike

881
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,880
and i think we need to put some effort

882
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,760
into it i do not want it to become an

883
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,519
unending effort

884
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,279
and i doubt i will agree with everything

885
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,600
mike right but that's this this group

886
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,200
needs to come to agreement on some of

887
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,440
that

888
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,600
okay so

889
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,360
eric and then we're going to close this

890
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,600
issue off for the moment i guess i'm i'm

891
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,880
a little uh

892
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,159
ignoring this question about like the

893
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,360
guard about like what text you've

894
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,480
written down i guess i don't really

895
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,200
understand the premise here which is um

896
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,399
you know one premise you could say is

897
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:25,760
like we're going to decide now for all

898
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,440
time that i don't know the rsc said it

899
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,399
being english

900
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,320
and and nothing nothing ever could ever

901
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,760
change that maybe one thing we could say

902
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,120
but the other thing you could say is you

903
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,279
know we're going to decide um that you

904
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,279
know the rc is being english and and

905
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,440
what might seem to be saying is the rs

906
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,279
rsvg can't change that but some other

907
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,720
process which you can and i guess i'd

908
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,600
like to understand what the nature of

909
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,039
that process is because it seems the

910
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,640
nature of that process is going to be

911
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,440
signed off from the isg and the iab and

912
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,720
some sort of survey of the community

913
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,320
which like is precise more or less

914
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,159
essentially the process through which

915
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,080
like things that go through rswg

916
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,440
actually get approved which is to say

917
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,200
they have to be signed off by like that

918
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,120
by like by like the

919
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,640
by the rswg which has to go through

920
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,919
community and actually signed up by the

921
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,080
rsap which is constituent by constituted

922
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,760
by people who work for the isg and the

923
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,279
iab and so like it seems to be that like

924
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,799
that isn't like i don't understand why

925
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,679
we have them as a new processor because

926
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,840
you have essentially the same moral

927
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,159
like moral foundation as the process of

928
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,039
learning rhwg so like i guess

929
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,120
let's ask this question of you know the

930
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,640
um you know like what the girl was

931
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,679
upstate i like to understand in what way

932
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,080
the um sorry my cat also opinions in

933
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,840
what way um you know

934
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,360
what other process we would invent for

935
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,640
making for going outside those guard

936
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,760
rails and what would give that greater

937
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,679
democratic legitimacy than the process

938
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,399
that we've coached here

939
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,479
okay i've closed the queue on this issue

940
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,840
and seems to have closed himself

941
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,080
we'll give him a minute to rejoin

942
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,880
uh we're going to have to take this up

943
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,919
on the list clearly um okay yeah sorry

944
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,919
about that like everything just blipped

945
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,280
for um

946
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,760
for 20 seconds there uh yeah we closed

947
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,119
the queue so

948
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,159
i think

949
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,839
what i would propose

950
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,359
is

951
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,719
if

952
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,760
we get

953
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,679
a proposal and i mean very quickly

954
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,679
um that can be discussed in brief

955
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,520
and we can see that there is going to be

956
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,079
some consensus on it

957
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,280
then i think

958
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,399
if we can get more elaborative words

959
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,040
that we that that that we don't see a

960
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,839
huge amount of disagreement over

961
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,839
and we get those quickly i think we

962
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,440
could include them

963
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,719
otherwise

964
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,800
um i think there's going to be a have to

965
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,320
be a lot of support

966
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,560
for really making a change at this point

967
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,520
so

968
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,918
um we'll take this to the list

969
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,320
but the clock is ticking

970
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,599
the issue has to be addressed quickly

971
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,839
and and in a way that can can garner

972
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,440
support

973
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,480
um and that's my proposal

974
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,000
okay so um no consensus yet

975
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,280
right

976
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,240
but the clock is ticking

977
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,720
right

978
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,880
proposals

979
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,240
that can garner support

980
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,320
quickly

981
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,799
are welcome

982
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,079
okay so

983
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,040
um we're gonna move on

984
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,200
let me share my screen again because

985
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,078
that blipped out too

986
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,760
that was really weird that it did that

987
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,320
and here we go

988
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,000
all right so then

989
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,480
that was heritage um

990
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,560
then uh mike

991
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,280
had a had proposal 125 and was going to

992
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,640
go to that

993
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,359
which requested a bit more specificity

994
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,200
on the individuals

995
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,240
um that uh that would be

996
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,400
addressed in section 4.1

997
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,320
i think i saw that jay supported this

998
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,960
change and unless their objections

999
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,480
um i would say uh to allow this to to

1000
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,160
proceed

1001
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,920
um

1002
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,520
we haven't had a lot of discussion but

1003
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,200
if there are any concerns just you know

1004
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,000
please raise them

1005
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,440
um

1006
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,680
then we have

1007
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,800
um

1008
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,599
permit rfs are this is issue 128 permit

1009
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,320
the rc not not to wait to be consulted

1010
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,079
and i'll just flash that here this is

1011
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,920
very small changes

1012
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,280
right

1013
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,240
it just say remove if requested and then

1014
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,720
change this to rsc my provide guidance

1015
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,440
this isn't section 5. and peter i think

1016
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,280
you covered one of the two of these in

1017
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,240
one of your messages

1018
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,000
and then um

1019
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,920
ecker raised the point

1020
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,040
wait a minute what happens um

1021
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,200
how can how can the rsap decline a

1022
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,480
proposal

1023
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,160
as is discussed in

1024
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,640
in the introduction

1025
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,280
which raised the point which was

1026
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,640
um

1027
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,480
we didn't actually say

1028
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,160
what happens

1029
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,320
if um

1030
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,599
uh if the rsap if there if there isn't a

1031
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,160
success if the vote fails

1032
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,000
um and so we should have been a little

1033
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,640
bit more specific about that and so i

1034
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,599
proposed text onto the list

1035
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,480
which was this

1036
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,800
which is if a vote is taken and not and

1037
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,960
the proposal not approved is returned to

1038
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,599
the rswg the rswg can consider making

1039
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,040
further changes and the key thing here

1040
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,160
is can consider it might be that the

1041
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,359
you know

1042
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,440
that that maybe the changes are so

1043
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,280
radical and there's such a disagreement

1044
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,839
between

1045
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,160
um you know the the r-sab and the in the

1046
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,280
rswg that it won't come of anything but

1047
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,359
maybe it will as eric pointed out on the

1048
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,960
list eric you want to comment further

1049
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,040
[Music]

1050
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,400
i was gonna say this text is fine with

1051
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,640
me um i i guess i i was just when i was

1052
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,599
what i was reacting to was just a

1053
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,800
suggestion that was something other than

1054
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,079
send the document back to the list

1055
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:24,880
because i don't understand what that

1056
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,800
would be right um like we have no way of

1057
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,480
saying there's just no structure for

1058
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,040
saying like we will never consider any

1059
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,200
document anything like this ever like so

1060
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,800
go away there's no structure for that so

1061
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,240
like it would this was not intended to

1062
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,520
be like a substantive change which is

1063
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,960
like identifying the text

1064
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,000
and just changed okay

1065
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,480
okay any other concerns please do feel

1066
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,359
free to raise them

1067
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,640
um

1068
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,520
then those are the issues that we would

1069
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,040
like to accept

1070
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,520
the one issue that uh in this discussion

1071
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,000
that i think i heard we really need to

1072
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,720
a little bit more discussion on is 119.

1073
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,960
we'll take that to the list and see how

1074
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,640
far we get

1075
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,400
the next list

1076
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,000
of

1077
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,040
points

1078
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,200
i want to just go through a little in a

1079
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,560
little bit more detail too um why is

1080
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,920
this not moving forward

1081
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,680
there we go all right so these are the

1082
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,040
issues that i did not hear support for

1083
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,280
um

1084
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,400
now um the first issue was i think from

1085
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,599
lars

1086
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,079
and was um

1087
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,119
what happens if you have multiple people

1088
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,800
who have resigned in succession

1089
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,240
um

1090
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,480
should the three month timer be reset

1091
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,320
and i actually think we heard

1092
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,480
um suggestions of going the other

1093
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,640
direction no in fact we should hard code

1094
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,480
the three-month timer to

1095
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,760
uh the approval of of the document by

1096
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,839
the

1097
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,280
rswg um

1098
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,119
and so uh

1099
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,280
unless people want to

1100
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,359
raise support for that

1101
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,400
um

1102
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,319
please feel free to comment and mike i

1103
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:09,359
saw you in the queue let me just ask um

1104
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,440
lars maybe if you could speak first if

1105
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,800
you don't mind mike

1106
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,079
lars was the one who opened this i'll

1107
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,160
just ask lars if you want to elaborate

1108
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,960
just a little here

1109
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,280
all right yeah so i don't care very

1110
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,920
deeply about this but um i raised it

1111
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,760
because maybe i'm a transport guy and i

1112
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,400
care about timers but um if we don't

1113
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,319
restart the timer when the second or

1114
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,040
subsequent position opens up those

1115
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,960
bodies will have a potentially very

1116
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,520
short timeline to fulfill their duties

1117
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,280
um and so i think the fair thing would

1118
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,119
be to restart the timer i see that you

1119
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,800
know you could sort of

1120
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,880
construct a case where somebody abuses

1121
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,079
that to sort of uh leave the body

1122
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,319
under staff but i i don't think that's a

1123
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,720
realistic sort of fear and we can sort

1124
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,640
of um deal with it with an appeals thing

1125
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,920
so that's my reason for modeling

1126
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,400
preferring that we uh restart the timer

1127
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
thanks okay

1128
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,680
mike

1129
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,800
thanks for being patient no worries um

1130
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,640
this interacts with the discussion we

1131
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,000
were having about who's doing last call

1132
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,160
so if the three if the three-month timer

1133
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,480
kicks off on the rswg approves it that

1134
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,960
includes the time for the last call on

1135
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,280
the rsab side

1136
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,800
okay

1137
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,760
and

1138
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,760
basically it means that

1139
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,920
if it's restarting every time somebody

1140
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,880
leaves the rsa b

1141
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,560
you could be a year

1142
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,440
at this um

1143
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,359
you know every time somebody leaves the

1144
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,680
thing will restart

1145
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,800
may not happen but that's the worst case

1146
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,839
so

1147
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:44,640
the

1148
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,079
i would be

1149
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,960
i would basically tie it to the

1150
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,280
um you know end of the community last

1151
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,079
call and three months from there period

1152
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,680
just don't

1153
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,520
don't worry about vacancies say that's

1154
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,640
the date and leave it up to the various

1155
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,800
various organizations to

1156
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,400
to meet their

1157
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,200
their requirements

1158
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,040
okay let me just turn this around does

1159
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,960
anybody i just want to ask do people

1160
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,800
agree if there are those who agree with

1161
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,119
lars reasoning can you please speak up

1162
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,520
colin

1163
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,200
um yeah so so i i i

1164
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,520
i i i do agree with lazy's reasoning and

1165
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,200
i think it in general uh i'm concerned

1166
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,720
that this

1167
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,079
process seems to be trying well the the

1168
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,839
document seems to be trying to impose

1169
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,680
constraints to make sure that everything

1170
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,079
happens on a very strict timeline

1171
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,079
and yet my understanding of what this

1172
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,079
group is doing is that there's nothing

1173
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,920
here where there are actually likely to

1174
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,920
be any time constraints

1175
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,319
so i don't quite understand why we are

1176
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,160
so concerned um about time limiting

1177
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,480
difficult cases where there's clearly

1178
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,640
something gone wrong and we need we need

1179
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,760
time to sort out the process

1180
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,040
and i think all that's going to end up

1181
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,560
happening is we'll do what we do with

1182
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,000
all the timers in the working group

1183
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,920
process in the itf which is in practice

1184
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,440
ignore them

1185
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,800
so i think we're we're on we're over

1186
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,560
constraining things by specifying all

1187
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,920
these these time limits

1188
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:26,240
okay uh echo

1189
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,560
yeah i i largely agree with colin and

1190
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,800
lars um though the timer should be 200

1191
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,640
milliseconds um

1192
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,599
the um uh um i guess i guess what i

1193
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,400
would say is also like it's not clear to

1194
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,880
me like how the timers like meaningfully

1195
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,079
work

1196
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,839
so i mean say we said this has to be

1197
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,760
done within you know this has to be done

1198
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,200
within within three

1199
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,880
within you know three months and you

1200
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,240
know then through some sequence and

1201
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,680
we're like might suggest basically we

1202
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,359
never we effectively never have quorum

1203
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,040
right because we never have like a full

1204
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,400
board it's like the effect is things

1205
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,880
just it can't be approved um i mean it

1206
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,480
be weird if the effect were that things

1207
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,240
were like the things were automatically

1208
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,240
approved um and so effective things just

1209
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,119
can't be approved which is the same

1210
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,400
there's like nothing happening at all so

1211
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,240
like i i just like i just don't think

1212
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,000
like this is like a case which is not i

1213
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,200
like it to happen which is pretty easy

1214
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,640
to get out of and

1215
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,599
like

1216
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,520
and like it does happen probably saying

1217
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,880
it's going severely wrong and it's not

1218
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,359
adversarial and like

1219
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,440
and just needs to be fixed so i i don't

1220
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,720
think trying to have a rule to manage

1221
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,759
that situation is as helpful

1222
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,800
okay

1223
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,440
let me turn this back around then does

1224
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,920
anybody mind

1225
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,040
this

1226
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,200
us

1227
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,319
uh permitting i i know mike spoke uh in

1228
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,079
terms of having this timer be automatic

1229
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,440
are there others at this point who feel

1230
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,200
like they they would be

1231
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,680
um upset if we did restart the timer

1232
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,839
based on an additional resignation

1233
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,040
okay

1234
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,319
i'm going to say them that we're going

1235
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,800
to provisionally accept this one

1236
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,599
yeah we'll have to go to the list

1237
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,280
obviously go to the list

1238
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,200
um okay then editorial expertise

1239
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,119
concerns this is something that john

1240
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,800
clenson

1241
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,560
expressed and others have expressed it

1242
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,839
at different times

1243
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:20,800
but

1244
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,200
um i didn't really see anything

1245
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,160
actionable or proposed changes to move

1246
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,520
on so

1247
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,880
um

1248
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,880
other than maybe the the whole model is

1249
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,240
something that they have concerns about

1250
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,599
but there's nothing really here to

1251
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,920
really take as an action

1252
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,280
so unless somebody has suggestions here

1253
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,319
i don't see how to address the issue

1254
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,440
um

1255
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,800
and i'll

1256
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,640
i'll just say does anybody want to speak

1257
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,240
to this in favor

1258
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,920
at this moment in terms of having well

1259
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,200
i'll say it actually is something

1260
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,960
different which is if you have

1261
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,640
something very specific a specific

1262
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,200
proposal bring it to the list quickly or

1263
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,520
this issue gets closed

1264
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,520
available

1265
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,640
me bring that one up

1266
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,560
okay and this is also another john

1267
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,599
clenson issue um i think he had a bit of

1268
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,720
a concern about a lack of accountability

1269
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,160
um

1270
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,920
i think though

1271
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,040
again unless there is a specific textual

1272
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,200
proposal i'm going to propose to close

1273
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,640
this issue

1274
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,960
i mean i didn't see really one

1275
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,240
um

1276
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,640
issue number 116 was different this i

1277
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,480
think was one that mark nottingham

1278
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,680
raised

1279
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,480
and uh it had to do with do we need to

1280
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,440
list the rfcs that get assigned into the

1281
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,480
rfc edit the new editorial stream

1282
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,599
um

1283
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,160
and we had discussed this previously in

1284
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,280
fact i had raised this issue previously

1285
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,520
and the group decided no we're not going

1286
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,000
to try and do that at this time

1287
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,520
um

1288
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,520
are there those who think that we should

1289
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,520
let me ask that question at this point

1290
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,040
if there are those who think that they

1291
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,240
that we should

1292
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,240
this did come up again recently and i

1293
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,880
think it relates to the svg

1294
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,440
rfc discussion that we just had on the

1295
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,040
list today

1296
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,800
people feel strong that we should list

1297
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,440
the rfcs that that the editorial stream

1298
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,240
owns

1299
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,119
please join the queue now and say so

1300
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,359
wes

1301
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,839
discussion going on in the chat that you

1302
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,079
might want to read which is should we

1303
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,640
move to issues that in face-to-face time

1304
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,960
rather than i'd propose all of these

1305
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,960
closed shears go to the list of just

1306
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,160
saying we're going to close all these

1307
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,680
unless somebody objects and instead move

1308
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,640
to stuff that requires something

1309
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,119
i guess anybody disagree

1310
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,839
we can do that

1311
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,160
oh we should have done that a little

1312
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,599
while ago sorry

1313
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:58,960
yeah maybe so

1314
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,839
um all right so uh let me get to these

1315
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,400
so these are the four issues

1316
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,640
um and i know we we have very little

1317
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,559
time and i apologize for that

1318
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,720
um these are the four issues that i

1319
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,000
think we need to spend a little bit of

1320
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,839
time on um we're going to start with

1321
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,400
issues 93 94. i'm going to bring up 93

1322
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,240
and martin may i invite you to really

1323
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,839
talk a little bit about this if that's

1324
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,200
okay

1325
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,400
um

1326
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,640
assuming you're still awake

1327
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,440
so

1328
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,160
let's see here another section when i

1329
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,359
went through the detection that talked

1330
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,920
about appeals it had very clear text

1331
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,800
on

1332
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,960
the appeal basis

1333
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,720
for rswg decisions that's pretty crisp

1334
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,680
and clear

1335
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,079
but there was no

1336
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,599
the parallel structure

1337
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,760
that also talked about what

1338
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,760
uh appeal how the appeals work for the

1339
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,200
rsab

1340
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,200
but it didn't have the same clear

1341
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,480
definition

1342
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,599
for what um an appeal could be and i was

1343
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,280
looking to

1344
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,359
provide some guidance on what happened

1345
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:00,400
there and

1346
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,319
i think consistent with the um

1347
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:05,920
the policies that we have for the

1348
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,040
working group side of things

1349
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,359
we have we already have agreement that

1350
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:12,480
um

1351
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,000
appeals only

1352
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,440
really happen on the basis of not

1353
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,760
following the process

1354
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,200
and um i tried to cover that but then

1355
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,880
realized that the

1356
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,640
rsab is

1357
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,800
given sort of this other task which is

1358
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,720
to interpret policy and to make

1359
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,800
decisions that need to be

1360
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,359
i guess timely and expedient

1361
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,839
and so i tried to capture that as well

1362
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,480
and so that this is just three sentences

1363
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,520
one

1364
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,640
they

1365
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,440
feel on the basis of one policy another

1366
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,680
one to say you can appeal on the basis

1367
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,680
that you believe that their

1368
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,920
decisions were in contravention of an

1369
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,960
existing

1370
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,760
agreed policy and third say no other

1371
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,760
cases

1372
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,559
didn't like some of the specific word

1373
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,400
choices but i think i think we thought

1374
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,280
about it on the list

1375
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,079
okay

1376
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,200
um

1377
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,440
can people do people have opinions about

1378
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,119
this text first of all

1379
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,040
are there those who would support martin

1380
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,920
and his concerns

1381
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,760
if you would just you know please join

1382
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,720
the queue and say so

1383
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,920
like okay i'm seeing something from

1384
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,520
peter

1385
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,480
okay and

1386
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,079
okay so we have a couple of people who

1387
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,200
do support

1388
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,800
and mike

1389
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,400
go ahead if you if you'd like to add

1390
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,920
in the wrong wrong point in the queue

1391
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,119
um

1392
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,400
the

1393
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,040
there doesn't need to be texts about

1394
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,559
uh about the appeal the question is i

1395
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,040
limiting it in the way that that there

1396
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,000
that is here is kind of weird

1397
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,240
um among other things because like i

1398
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,800
said in my other text the rsab is

1399
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,480
generally going to be the interpreter of

1400
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,000
the policy

1401
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,880
so

1402
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,040
explaining how they violated the policy

1403
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,480
they interpreted is going to be kind of

1404
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,520
an interesting interesting discussion

1405
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,960
um

1406
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,200
i think the key here mike and just if i

1407
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,200
may

1408
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,520
if i could just add i think this is

1409
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,920
does the iab get to reinterpret what

1410
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,760
they whether whether the rsap

1411
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,200
misinterprets something that's the

1412
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,200
question

1413
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,800
it would be difficult for them to do

1414
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,400
that because they

1415
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,839
i i don't

1416
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,760
do they have the specific domain

1417
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,680
knowledge of what's been going on at

1418
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,359
that point

1419
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,720
do you need

1420
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,079
you know i

1421
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,599
i don't know

1422
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,839
um

1423
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,559
if i may i think

1424
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,520
where what i saw from from martin's

1425
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,040
proposal was that there's two things

1426
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,200
that we're asking the rsab to do one is

1427
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,480
to approve

1428
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,000
documents that come out of the working

1429
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,720
group the other is

1430
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,480
in cases where it's unclear that

1431
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,079
whether there's an existing policy or

1432
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:24,559
whether there's a gap in policies and

1433
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,079
the authors and our rpc and other

1434
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,440
interested parties are trying to work

1435
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,880
things out

1436
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,400
um i think martin's right we need to

1437
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,040
make someone responsible for coming to a

1438
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,960
resolution of that and so his proposal

1439
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,200
was the rsabs ought to be the ones who

1440
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,440
are on the hook to make sure that those

1441
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,920
things get resolved and if the thing

1442
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,119
gets resolved in a way that

1443
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:48,720
it ought to be appealable what the r

1444
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,960
said what our sub action was taken

1445
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,599
because they might have ignored the fact

1446
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,359
or missed the fact that there actually

1447
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,000
was a policy that covered this instance

1448
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,160
and so i think that's what i got from

1449
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,839
martin and i think it does make sense to

1450
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,119
have something along those lines because

1451
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:04,559
this is something that the artists have

1452
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,800
ought to be responsible for and there's

1453
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,280
got to be some sort of uh process but to

1454
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,720
hold them responsible thanks

1455
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,640
there's one other thing that i might add

1456
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,520
here um which is that when there is no

1457
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,240
policy and the rsap makes a decision

1458
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,359
that's not appealable at that point

1459
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:26,000
so we're giving them that much rope and

1460
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,400
they're they're allowed to to make those

1461
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,599
decisions on

1462
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:32,480
on their own authority

1463
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,440
okay mike and i'm sorry peter you still

1464
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,200
in the queue or uh

1465
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,480
i'm coming out

1466
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,960
it's mike

1467
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,559
and then we'll close the queue and we'll

1468
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,200
take this back to the list okay

1469
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,319
yeah

1470
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:49,920
i think it's i keep looking at this and

1471
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,520
there's a chicken and egg problem here

1472
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,880
because the

1473
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,280
policies are written editorial stream

1474
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,720
documents that have already been

1475
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,240
published

1476
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,640
okay not the document that's coming

1477
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,040
through the rsab at the time that's

1478
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,599
being evaluated

1479
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,200
so

1480
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,920
you could point to a previous editorial

1481
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,319
stream document and say okay

1482
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,960
that says we have to publish this

1483
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,800
um and that would be the appealable

1484
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,760
thing but the document itself

1485
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,440
if it's trying to esta if it's trying to

1486
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,040
bootstrap its policy the rsav can say no

1487
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,839
i think that's the right answer

1488
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,640
okay

1489
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,079
i think this one has to go back to the

1490
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:31,359
list

1491
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:32,720
for for a bit

1492
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:37,200
for a bit more detail so no consensus

1493
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,319
back to the list for now

1494
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,160
and i think probably the best thing to

1495
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,640
do is to get into more the source of the

1496
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,640
issue at first before we start

1497
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,640
formulating with language

1498
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,880
um this really didn't get enough uh

1499
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,520
discussion on list and and i'd like to

1500
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,960
see some more

1501
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,079
um issue 94 is also martin's um this

1502
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,319
one's a much hopefully much simpler

1503
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,880
issue what it basically said was

1504
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,520
when there is a disagreement a policy

1505
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,440
disagreement

1506
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,160
um before it get uh

1507
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,240
rather than just say uh

1508
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,319
that the parties can can resolve the

1509
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,960
disagreement that um the responsibility

1510
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,160
lies with

1511
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,480
rsap and this is when you have an inter

1512
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,160
stream dispute

1513
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,400
so um

1514
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,240
the change is being that's being

1515
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,559
proposed here is this

1516
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,559
are there any concerns with this change

1517
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,720
let me just ask that

1518
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,720
this is almost edited it's not quite

1519
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,319
editorial because it does shift the

1520
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,559
responsibility of the rsap does anybody

1521
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,119
have a concern about this change

1522
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:43,200
someone raised a concern about that the

1523
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,200
time order that this implies and i think

1524
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,559
that we can just fix that editorially

1525
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,480
yeah i just sent something to the list

1526
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,160
that that is a

1527
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,960
text so we can talk about that there

1528
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,799
okay okay

1529
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:01,799
all right then let's we're gonna proceed

1530
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,640
sorry uh yeah please close your mic if

1531
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,839
um

1532
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:09,119
if you're done speaking uh okay so i i

1533
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,319
think we have

1534
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,400
uh 117

1535
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,920
we've had a lot of discussion on the

1536
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,799
list

1537
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:18,000
around whether the rswg can make

1538
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,400
statements or not this will be the last

1539
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,520
issue we covered today because we're

1540
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,200
going to run out of time and i'd just

1541
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,440
like people to to to provide some

1542
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,040
comments to say how they'd like to see

1543
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,440
this issue resolved i'll make two two

1544
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,119
comments the first is

1545
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,000
um

1546
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
it seems to me that the overhead

1547
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,079
of statements or what have you is really

1548
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,400
in the finding of consensus

1549
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,720
um and not so much in the bits uh but

1550
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,720
that's elliot's personal opinion

1551
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,760
um

1552
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,599
and uh the the

1553
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,319
actually i'll just leave it at that um

1554
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,720
and just ask people to comment about

1555
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,920
where they see

1556
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,880
where they see the right resolution here

1557
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,960
in terms of proposals

1558
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,359
uh joel

1559
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:04,240
it's very clear the rswg can send email

1560
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,599
to anybody it wants the rswg chairs can

1561
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,240
send email to anybody they want but

1562
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,319
statements that are binding in the sense

1563
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:14,960
of iesg statements

1564
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,960
are not within the process we've laid

1565
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,520
out and i would be very strongly opposed

1566
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,160
to trying to extend the process to do so

1567
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,119
and

1568
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:25,040
none of the arguments i have seen for

1569
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,359
doing so

1570
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,079
make it uh are i'm sorry i i can't get

1571
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,960
my head around them

1572
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,760
okay

1573
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,200
um and by the way i'm going to split

1574
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,480
this dish into two because there's

1575
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,160
statements and then there's like a

1576
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,880
responsibility a discussion that also

1577
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,400
happened

1578
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,280
but on the statements aspect

1579
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,280
miriam

1580
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,559
yeah i i i

1581
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,160
agree to the point that i think the the

1582
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,839
heavy part of the process is getting

1583
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,119
consensus right and if you have

1584
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,200
consensus i don't see why you would just

1585
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,440
issue a statement or an rfc so i think

1586
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,280
that the working group should really be

1587
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,400
bounded to

1588
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,160
writing rfcs that's their purpose

1589
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,839
putting policies into rfcs getting

1590
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,119
consent

1591
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,880
so if at all any kind of statements are

1592
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,799
needed then maybe it's for the

1593
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:20,240
uh rsab because the rsab as we just said

1594
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,799
might you know resolve conflicts on a on

1595
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,000
a

1596
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,079
more timely

1597
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:28,000
basis and for these kind of conflicts or

1598
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,440
any kind of issues then maybe want to

1599
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,400
write them down somewhere

1600
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,760
okay what other people like to comment

1601
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,960
on this aspect mark

1602
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,520
two minutes

1603
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,240
yes it's working i think it's working

1604
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,079
the little graph is moving

1605
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:47,440
um

1606
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,040
yeah i i think

1607
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,440
if if the statement can become and not

1608
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,799
necessarily

1609
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,240
as was discussed unless there are

1610
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,599
situations where

1611
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,359
it might not be good for it to come

1612
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:58,880
operative as soon as there is you know

1613
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,720
consensus and it goes through the rsav

1614
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,760
process

1615
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,440
that goes a long way towards addressing

1616
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,640
this but

1617
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,760
you know

1618
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,079
keeping in mind that that the

1619
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:11,040
there is it is still cost in terms of

1620
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,359
overhead for the authors going through

1621
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:15,760
auth 48 it goes to the rpc

1622
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,319
as we all hopefully know the rpc cost is

1623
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:20,240
something on the order of a hundred and

1624
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,480
twenty five dollars a page

1625
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,799
um it seems a little silly to publish

1626
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,240
some of the things that might come out

1627
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,240
as rfcs but i'm not gonna

1628
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,400
lie down in the mud about that um i do

1629
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,400
question however why the iab and the

1630
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,280
iisg put out non-rfc statements quite

1631
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,799
often

1632
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:38,079
if this is the the attitude of the

1633
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:40,160
community let me ask you mark mark mark

1634
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,680
let me ask you and the group this is

1635
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,640
this something that maybe the the

1636
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,720
could it's a process refinement that

1637
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,520
could be addressed um in the rswg and

1638
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,480
the rsap itself

1639
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,720
a discussion and uh some people thought

1640
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,160
very strongly that

1641
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,960
the the rules cannot be modified by this

1642
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,160
body um and and so

1643
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,280
uh i would be concerned about

1644
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,040
assertions that that could be a path out

1645
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,359
of this

1646
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,760
okay miriam you you want the queue again

1647
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,319
you just want to clarify because uh

1648
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:20,319
mark brought up by his gen ib statement

1649
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:23,839
so these documents are explicitly not

1650
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:25,920
community consensus statements right

1651
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,760
these are statements from the iab which

1652
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,920
is a well-defined set of people and

1653
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,839
these are statements from the iep which

1654
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:32,880
is another

1655
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,720
small set of people so this is not

1656
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,000
community consensus

1657
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,520
okay it is the bottom of the hour here

1658
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,440
in switzerland and i think in most

1659
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,440
places i apologize that we didn't quite

1660
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,359
get to the last issue

1661
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:49,920
on the 117 i'm going to say it unless

1662
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,920
there's strong concern

1663
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,920
i think the statement aspect is

1664
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,880
something that we'll leave aside for now

1665
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,160
but the

1666
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,559
other aspect i want to just ask people

1667
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,720
to take as a homework assignment is to

1668
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,160
make sure that people are comfortable

1669
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,319
with the idea that the rswg can

1670
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:07,520
establish

1671
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,119
processes

1672
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:10,559
to address

1673
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,520
uh aspects like open source or or

1674
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,200
content management

1675
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,680
um working of course

1676
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,559
together with the llc in doing so

1677
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:22,799
um we i we started a little bit of that

1678
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,720
discussion i had an exchange with mark

1679
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,400
on that i'd like other people to comment

1680
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,799
on lists and if we can close on that

1681
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:30,559
then i think we're very close to being

1682
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,880
done um we actually made a lot of

1683
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,720
progress today believe it or not we

1684
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,119
covered most of the issues

1685
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:38,640
that that were open you guys were really

1686
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,880
prolific in terms of agree

1687
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,599
and

1688
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,119
very conscientious

1689
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,440
in terms of reading the document for

1690
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,640
clarity uh for gaps it was all really

1691
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,640
good uh so we'll we have a little bit

1692
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,520
more work to do but we're really close

1693

with that

1695
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,079
what i'd like to do is just ask for any

1696
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:00,000
other business i think we are out of

1697

1705
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:27,280
need an another interim it depends on

1706
