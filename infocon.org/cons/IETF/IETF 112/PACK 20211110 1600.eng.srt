1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,040
folks it's the top of the hour i think

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,240
we're gonna give people a couple more

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,759
minutes to see if they can straggle in

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,080
and then we're gonna try to start

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,760
i will note that i asked for an hour and

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,600
they gave us two so there's probably

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,279
little chance that we will use the full

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,519
two hours

9
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,600
a couple more people coming in so that's

10
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
good give them a go we'll give another

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,320
minute and then we'll get started

12
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
okay i think we've kind of waited long

13
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,520
enough for people to show up um i guess

14
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,919
i want to welcome everybody to wpac

15
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,680
um at iatf 112 um the chairs shawn and

16
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,200
david um we're here i see the um our

17
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,238
editors are here as well

18
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,520
um just a reminder we're gonna record

19
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,080
this uh please if you're not speaking uh

20
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,400
make sure your your microphone is muted

21
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,160
um if you wanna come off uh turn your

22
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,680
video on when you're speaking that's

23
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,959
fine um

24
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,480
this room is small enough that it

25
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,319
shouldn't really crash it um there's

26
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,560
some links there for the useful things

27
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,760
uh

28
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,000
um for the links for the meat echo audio

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,519
only in cody md

30
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,120
um so next there we go click on the next

31
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,519
slide this is the note well um this

32
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,319
relates to you know all the the

33
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,000
um ipr notices that we have um

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,080
you know how to working group progress

35
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,200
all kinds of stuff i'll get to the

36
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
annual harassment things later in the

37
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,560
code of conduct the copyright patents

38
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,120
basically um if you know anything about

39
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,519
uh ipr in the space you declare it

40
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,040
before you participate and that includes

41
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,959
basically communicating in any way to

42
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,080
the working group

43
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,360
um

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,640
next we're gonna go you might have seen

45
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,760
this in a couple of working groups where

46
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,360
we're trying to trying to focus on the

47
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,440
code of conduct guidelines um this

48
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,200
working group has not had this problem

49
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,480
but i think it's worth just kind of

50
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,080
repeating everywhere we've got an rc

51
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,159
that defines the code of conduct

52
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,440
basically the

53
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,799
highlights are to treat college

54
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,560
colleagues with respect

55
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,239
speak lowly with slowly which i

56
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,319
sometimes have a problem with um try not

57
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,840
to use slang so everybody can kind of

58
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,640
get on uh and understand what's going on

59
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,799
um we should dispute ideas by uh

60
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,959
reasoned argument yeah use our best

61
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,120
engineering judgment find the best

62
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,720
solution for the whole internet and

63
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,360
contribute to the ongoing the itf um and

64
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,120
remember that we'd like this to apply

65
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,000
everywhere not just in not just on the

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,239
mean echo channel but also in the mic

67
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,040
uh

68
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,280
jabber media etc and the mailing list

69
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,120
for that matter

70
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,400
all right i kind of know that that's us

71
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
the agenda is pretty straightforward

72
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,239
like i said um i did request an hour and

73
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,640
they gave us two so i basically just

74
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,920
split it down the middle we have two

75
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,280
documents that we've adopted we have

76
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,720
more that we need to adopt but these are

77
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,880
the two that we're starting with um and

78
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,079
kind of just split them between use

79
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,478
cases in bundle um i do note that i put

80
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,720
felipe's name on the bundle uh draft i

81
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,680
think it's probably just going to be

82
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,720
jeffrey

83
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,560
um and that's really it we didn't have

84
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,240
any particular slides i thought we would

85
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,720
basically just go to the um

86
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,680
repo

87
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,759
and start working through any issues and

88
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,000
have an open discussion unless

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,320
anybody has any other ideas and wants to

90
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,880
bash this agenda

91
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,880
jeffrey go ahead

92
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,720
cool um i also asked felipe to

93
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,280
kind of discuss a little bit um about

94
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,400
kind of his work and his team's work on

95
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,520
uh bundle implementation progress and so

96
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,600
when we get to that section um i think

97
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,720
he'll have

98
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,080
some stuff to present

99
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,800
great um so you know i put his name in

100
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,840
the right place then come completely

101
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,639
call

102
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,720
um all right so let's get into the use

103
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,479
cases i'm just going to switch

104
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,280
first

105
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,080
yes

106
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,000
there is one thing that we uh skipped

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,160
right over when that is we need a scribe

108
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,360
please

109
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,560
oh yes

110
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,120
take notes into the cody md uh hopefully

111
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,479
other people keep an eye on it and the

112
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,479
chairs will definitely go over it

113
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,919
afterward but

114
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,840
somebody to get the initial set of notes

115
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,440
into the cody would certainly be helpful

116
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,440
call for volunteers

117
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,400
can't be jeffrey he's busy

118
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,800
is anybody else paying attention

119
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,160
mr bishop

120
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,560
mr shaheed can i implore upon either of

121
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,400
you to perhaps pay enough attention for

122
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,400
notes

123
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,039
is

124
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,600
anybody listening

125
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,720
other than jeffrey

126
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,080
yeah we only really need to keep

127
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,440
highlight the

128
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,880
decisions made we don't really need

129
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,120
blow-by-blow

130
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,520
minutes

131
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,120
okay

132
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,319
oh

133
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,919
siobhan i was encouraged by seeing your

134
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,440
name but i appreciate that you might

135
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,479
have to duck out so

136
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,199
yes we should have worked this out ahead

137
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,319
of time sorry we did

138
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,120
not is there anybody who doesn't

139
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,919
possibly have to duck away in 15 minutes

140
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,479
oh and jeffrey has volunteered to write

141
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,240
down the decisions which also the chairs

142
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,319
are capable of doing so um

143
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,919
okay thank you very much justin we

144
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,520
appreciate uh we appreciate that highly

145
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,120
and like i said the chairs will go over

146
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,440
the notes um to corroborate with you

147
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,639
know our

148
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,800
sense of the meeting and of course

149
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,960
there's a youtube video so

150
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,120
that should be sufficient

151
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,199
thank you again justin and away we go

152
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,360
with jeffrey

153
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,800
right

154
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,240
so the

155
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,880
um the use cases document is basically

156
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,080
the

157
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,599
the content that you all have seen

158
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,639
before um it's still on my plate to to

159
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,440
split out the um

160
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,680
the controversial use cases into an

161
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,879
appendix

162
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,440
um and leave the rest

163
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,680
uh in the in the main section

164
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,560
um i believe that the primary

165
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,800
non-controversial use cases are

166
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,319
um

167
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,919
basically the the

168
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,960
uh prefetch of of content unit

169
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,800
of like sub resources

170
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,759
um

171
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,840
and so so just about everything else

172
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,240
will will go into the appendix does

173
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,400
anyone have particular

174
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,240
and then i'll also

175
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,960
split out requirements um similarly so

176
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,160
that they

177
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,759
the only kind of essential requirements

178
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,599
are the ones that that are required by

179
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,800
the by the read on use cases um does

180
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,479
anyone have particular use cases that

181
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,280
you that you want to kind of see stay in

182
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,279
the top section that

183
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,039
um that kind of shouldn't move to the

184
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,039
appendix

185
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,560
i don't hear anyone

186
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,320
um

187
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,080
so yeah i'll i'll proceed with that oh

188
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,040
uh

189
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,079
uh free to go please

190
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,720
can you hear me okay i have to obviously

191
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,959
i'm not a news case but i'm just

192
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,200
wondering and this might be addressed by

193
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
the change you have and but just

194
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,240
wondering why is that resource funding

195
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,200
was so

196
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,959
like low in the list

197
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,959
of the use cases i think they ordered by

198
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,800
priority right

199
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,440
yeah at least roughly bright priority um

200
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,800
it was

201
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,040
it was not kind of

202
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,519
in the in the top set of things that

203
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,360
that i was interested in when starting

204
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,120
the the work

205
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,080
um

206
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,320
kind of we were we were looking at

207
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,399
uh at ways to replace

208
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,519
um

209
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,519
or ways to to compete with

210
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,839
native apps where you can share the the

211
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,440
installation file

212
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,519
um but it seems like there's

213
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,360
kind of we can we can get part way there

214
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,279
by doing sub resources and there's a lot

215
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,959
more consensus

216
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,880
in the community for for doing sub

217
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,360
resources first

218
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,040
and so that that seems like the right

219
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,040
thing to focus on uh initially

220
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,760
yeah um jeffrey one thing i'll observe

221
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,920
too is a couple of weeks ago uh larry

222
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,720
has um asked about this whole um my

223
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,320
multi-part thing and then he wasn't

224
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,399
suggesting we use it necessarily but he

225
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,399
wanted to add it as a use case and so on

226
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,560
and so forth do you have thoughts um

227
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,720
perhaps that you could even then uh

228
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,640
share with larry on the list for others

229
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,160
to digest

230
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,839
because larry keep coming back to this

231
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,360
my multi-part thing um and so far we

232
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,640
haven't seen energy in the group um to

233
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,440
uh

234
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,519
go down that particular path but if you

235
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,399
had

236
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,240
some some relevant thoughts it would

237
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,399
certainly be welcome

238
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,440
yeah

239
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,240
the

240
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,560
the multi-part kind of scheme like

241
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,519
clearly

242
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,279
clearly the bundle format does compete

243
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,720
with multi-part

244
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,839
um

245
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,839
but the particular use cases like

246
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,920
multi-part is a set of formats rather

247
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,600
than a set of use cases

248
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,560
um and so it i think hasn't been clear

249
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,360
like what use case in particular we're

250
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,800
missing here

251
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,720
um and this

252
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,240
kind of the the use cases that we've

253
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,600
listed

254
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,760
are seem like the ones that

255
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,240
that we want to focus on um and i don't

256
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,640
think larry has said like like here are

257
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,720
use cases you're missing he's just

258
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,600
said

259
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
like here's a bunch of multi-part stuff

260
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,279
you should you should look at

261
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,800
that kind of completely replacing it

262
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,200
right i i've also been confused on what

263
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,560
larry sees as the use case there

264
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,360
as opposed to the possibility of

265
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,279
compatible formatting

266
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,480
um

267
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
and i will follow up with larry on the

268
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,160
list suggesting that

269
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,399
if he sees a relevant specific use case

270
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,160
there that he follow up to you with

271
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,279
actual suggested text

272
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,240
yeah

273
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,560
and and it i think we do

274
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,320
i think we do replace

275
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,279
most most or all of what

276
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,279
of like the particular subtypes of

277
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,800
multi-part like you can you can

278
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,320
accomplish them

279
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,920
using bundles

280
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,880
um

281
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,200
and it yeah it's not clear what what in

282
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,800
particular would need to change to

283
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,279
replace the rest

284
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,239
great thank you

285
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,399
um i guess the question is do we want to

286
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,160
talk about the implementation experience

287
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,839
or sorry are we done with use cases

288
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,120
yeah so we're done with your cases i

289
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,240
guess the question is should we talk

290
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,320
about implementation experience um

291
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,760
before we talk about the draft i think

292
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,800
that might be interesting because it

293
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,079
might inform

294
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:34,959
um

295
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,079
the bundles draft so do we want to get

296
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,360
felipe the

297
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,040
floor here and let him let him talk

298
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480
that is my suggestion

299
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,639
all right felipe

300
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,920
welcome to come to the front of the room

301
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,120
thanks

302
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,200
let me see if i can share my screen over

303
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,200
here

304
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,839
okay

305
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,320
okay hello everybody

306
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,160
i'm

307
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,920
yeah you're gonna say that well

308
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,639
yeah we're good

309
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,760
okay so

310
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,360
i'm alex

311
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,600
from realia we've been working in

312
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,519
partnership with

313
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,360
io

314
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,160
feel free to reach out after the meeting

315
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,480
if you have any questions

316
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,959
and this is a short update on the work

317
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,720
that we have been doing on the use case

318
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,040
of resource preloading using bundle

319
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,480
responses

320
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,800
you can have a look at the explainer for

321
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,519
more details

322
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,680
the general approach is that a page

323
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,839
could provide a list of resources to

324
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:20,880
preload

325
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,399
and then we'll send a request to the

326
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,639
server with the list of two resources

327
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,120
that are not in the case

328
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,040
and then the server would reply with a

329
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,199
web bundle containing the resources

330
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,160
each resource can be stored in the cache

331
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,440
individually and our proposal restricts

332
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,519
the origin and the path of the resources

333
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,920
to those of the reference bundle file

334
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,360
and also

335
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,079
enforces url consistency in the sense

336
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,800
that for a given url the server

337
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,279
must return the same resource regardless

338
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,519
of whether the request has been done

339
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,079
individually or as part of a bundle

340
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,279
chromium

341
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,880
has an implementation of a similar set

342
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,399
of ideas

343
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,000
and we have an open issue there where we

344
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,440
want to

345
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,639
gradually converse towards a common

346
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,160
complete specification

347
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,600
in the last meeting of the group we

348
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,720
discuss some changes to keep the

349
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,160
spec as simple as possible and to focus

350
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,040
on

351
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,320
consensus functionality like reloading

352
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,800
while also allowing for additional

353
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,360
sector sections that may extend the

354
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,440
format for specific use cases

355
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,519
related to the implementation of this

356
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,399
spec

357
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,959
there is a node.js module to create and

358
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,199
read bundles

359
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,959
and one of the things that we have been

360
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,360
doing over the past weeks has been to

361
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,519
update this tool to support

362
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,320
the new updated version of the spec

363
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,120
while also keeping compatibility with

364
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,079
the previous version

365
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,720
so with this node.js module a

366
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,759
we can

367
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,920
prototype uh implement a server that is

368
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,560
aware of bundles and is able to

369
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,959
handle and manipulate manipulate them

370
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,680
this is how the backwards compatibility

371
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,560
works where the new version is used by

372
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,199
default but you can specify a previous

373
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,000
one and then the code in the bundle

374
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,839
will be able to pick the right version

375
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,360
and

376
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,040
this node.js module can

377
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,720
also be

378
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,040
used

379
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,199
in the browser

380
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,839
to get some experimentation that we

381
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,600
managed to do it

382
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,199
which means that

383
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,920
since we have support for web bundles in

384
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,360
the server and

385
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,880
in the client we can prototype the whole

386
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,160
bundle preloading use case

387
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,400
so that's what we have done

388
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,599
our

389
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,280
client

390
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,839
parses the

391
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,400
declarations in the html file that lists

392
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,119
the resources that the page wants to

393
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,119
preload and then sends

394
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,439
an http request with a specific header

395
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,720
that lists the resources that are not in

396
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,000
the case in the case of the prototype

397
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,840
we are using a service worker so the

398
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,160
cashier is the service workers case

399
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,600
and then the bundles or those requests

400
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,200
are served by a small web server

401
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,080
that

402
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,120
supports where abandoned preloading with

403
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,280
subsetting and is able to create bundles

404
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,960
on the fly so

405
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,039
if the client requests only a subset of

406
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,360
the resources that have been listed on

407
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,480
the page

408
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,039
then the server can return only those

409
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:07,039
resources in a new bundle

410
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,360
so this is how the

411
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,440
current syntax that we have been using

412
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,600
looks like whereas you basically specify

413
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,000
a reference web bundle file in the

414
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,039
server and then list the resources

415
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,000
and

416
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,520
you can use

417
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,799
absolute or relative urls for this

418
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,360
and this is just a draft

419
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,000
one benefit of this prototyping strategy

420
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,160
is that it wouldn't take much to try out

421
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,280
different syntaxes for this

422
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,440
we have a

423
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,000
couple examples at the moment in the

424
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,080
experience repository

425
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,400
the first one is a very basic test where

426
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,240
some resources are pre-loaded and you

427
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,559
can use the dev tools in the browser to

428
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,280
see how those resources are retrieved

429
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,520
and then one by one they are made

430
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,280
available in the cashier so they are

431
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,760
retrieved in one request but then they

432
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,400
become several entries in the service

433
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,720
workers casino

434
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,520
the

435
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,160
the second example is a small react

436
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,640
application that uses webpack as a

437
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,240
bundler tool

438
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,120
and

439
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,679
in this case bundle preloading is

440
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,919
already able to improve the performance

441
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,320
because the resources

442
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,039
can be loaded in parallel in one single

443
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,320
request whereas by default what

444
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,240
webpack does is that it loads the

445
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,520
javascript

446
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,360
and then the javascript loads the rest

447
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,039
of the resources so it happens in

448
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,400
sequence which is slower

449
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,600
so

450
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,960
what have we learned so far well first

451
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,480
that this

452
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,679
approach works for prototyping and for

453
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,280
trying out a solution for this use case

454
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,240
it already allows us to test

455
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,160
different scenarios where the solution

456
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,600
might be used

457
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,320
and it gives us an

458
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,919
easy way to

459
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,480
experiment with different syntaxes for

460
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,280
the

461
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,760
html tags or for the http headers

462
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,760
so far the performance is actually

463
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,280
reasonable

464
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,159
of course using a service worker has its

465
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,440
own overhead but other than that we are

466
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,640
seeing that the solution has good

467
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,039
potential for improving performance in

468
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,200
the future because we are seeing that

469
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,440
we can reduce the number of

470
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,240
requests response round trips we can

471
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,159
parallelize

472
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,000
downloading resources

473
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,080
we can put individual resources in the

474
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,039
cache and so on

475
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,039
the next steps for this line of work is

476
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:45,919
to

477
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,039
have better integration for

478
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,840
with

479
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,039
blender tools so it's easier to try out

480
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,679
in in more use cases anymore

481
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,600
pages

482
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,960
one of my colleagues cam is working on

483
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,720
benchmarking

484
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,640
this solution and comparing it with

485
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,039
bundle tools and with other solutions

486
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,720
we want to create more examples so

487
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,440
we are really looking for ideas

488
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,600
of

489
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,679
scenarios where people feel that this

490
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,400
could be a good solution and something

491
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,600
that they would like to try out

492
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,559
and a final thought is that i'm really

493
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,280
wondering if this approach

494
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,200
of prototyping and then iterating

495
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,720
on that

496
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,200
can also be applied for other use cases

497
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,520
that we have on the table

498
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,159
and that's all for my short update if

499
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,520
you have any questions thank you

500
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,000
your last point

501
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,760
is there any reason that you think that

502
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,679
what the way you're going wouldn't work

503
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,400
with the other use cases

504
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,360
not necessarily i mean some of the use

505
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,520
cases are pretty

506
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,679
specific i'm not sure that they would

507
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,440
be suitable for

508
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,480
prototyping just with uh just in

509
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
javascript

510
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,600
but it was more of a

511
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,080
of a general thought of

512
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,760
whether this is something that can be

513
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,520
used to try out other scenarios and

514
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,320
other another use cases

515
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,000
basically because one of the things that

516
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,919
we are looking for is to

517
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,200
find

518
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,520
um

519
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,559
areas where people would be interested

520
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,639
in seeing this being being tried out

521
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,760
the some of the use cases the more

522
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,679
long-term use cases like being able to

523
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,840
install a web app with kind of accurate

524
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,720
trust

525
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,880
uh can't be prototyped in javascript

526
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,760
because

527
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,360
you have to bootstrap somehow like you

528
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,960
can't install the service worker that

529
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
that does the kind of that is the

530
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,000
prototype um if you can't bootstrap

531
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,960
somewhere

532
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,480
um but

533
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,000
for instance the

534
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,799
the other use case that um the chrome

535
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,840
origin trial is capturing where um

536
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,559
kind of ads are being served as as more

537
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,559
self-contained sub-resources that

538
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,320
probably could have been prototype this

539
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,480
way

540
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,880
i think so i think so because basically

541
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,039
what you need for that is just to be

542
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,320
able to

543
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,520
load the

544
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,840
the bundle and then

545
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,559
retrieve each of the of the resources

546
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,400
that's a good thing thank you

547
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,440
yeah uh siobhan please

548
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,679
yeah i just wanted to say that they

549
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,080
definitely believe that preload is the

550
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,400
way to go where the client can choose

551
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,720
which resources it wants to load

552
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,080
um and i

553
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,200
do wish that the original trial also

554
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,559
i've gone with that approach because i

555
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,440
think

556
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,799
anything else like where the client

557
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,400
cannot choose

558
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,159
a resource to load would just basically

559
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,360
be a non-starter

560
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,480
yeah one of the things that we want to

561
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,840
try out is

562
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,678
some benchmarking because

563
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,080
we want to see for example what happens

564
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,000
if the client requests

565
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,320
a lot of resources in in one go does

566
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,520
that have a

567
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,000
very big impact does that create a very

568
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,919
large http

569
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,840
request and has to travel to the server

570
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,799
and so on

571
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,760
so those are the kinds of uh mortgage

572
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,840
cases that we that we want to try out

573
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,760
that was oh sean's back

574
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,640
well

575
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,400
john were you moving on before the same

576
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,840
thing that i think that we've uh we

577
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,120
drained the queue on that one that i

578
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,159
think we're off to um jeffrey to talk

579
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,760
about the bundle

580
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,760
yep

581
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,120
the

582
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,240
the biggest question that i

583
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,159
that i discovered recently

584
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,039
was

585
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,480
how to interact with um the new uh http

586
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,760
working groups

587
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,640
uh binary hdp format

588
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,159
um

589
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,320
the kind of

590
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,720
uh and i forwarded it to the list

591
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,960
but the the direction that that seems

592
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,799
appropriate to me is try to try to

593
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,159
converge them

594
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,080
um even though that'll

595
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,919
that probably involves several changes

596
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,000
to the to the bundle format

597
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
um and i was curious if people had

598
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,440
thoughts on

599
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,880
on

600
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,640
anything about that that binary

601
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,360
representation

602
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,520
well the person most likely to have

603
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,120
thoughts about it is unfortunately not

604
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,600
in the room right now

605
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,480
yeah

606
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,039
um and just not to be opaque or anything

607
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,640
that's uh martin thompson who's working

608
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,640
on the other binary representation draft

609
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,600
but yes uh

610
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,320
javon has said in chat um

611
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,840
convergence here would be good

612
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,159
minimizing the differences so

613
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,440
um

614
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,960
until we get a little bit more

615
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
information though about what challenges

616
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,760
might be involved there you know i think

617
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
you and martin have to start seeing how

618
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,799
you can

619
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,320
work it all out and then what issues

620
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,279
that that might bring up

621
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,480
let's see

622
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,799
what's going to basically what i was

623
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:05,840
going to say

624
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,080
um you know if we we should we should

625
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,640
definitely try to uh

626
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,200
achieve uh consensus to use one format

627
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,480
because if we have set performance i

628
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,159
think it's a recipe for disaster

629
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,640
yep

630
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,399
um here are the

631
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,120
here are the issues um on the repository

632
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,000
um

633
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,240
i don't i don't have kind of i don't

634
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
think any of them are are particularly

635
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,600
like

636
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,799
urgent to answer right now

637
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,080
let's see does anyone want to kind of

638
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,559
dig into any of these

639
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,039
today

640
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,760
i guess holler on the chat if one looks

641
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,120
interesting to to ding it to

642
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,720
otherwise we could end early and

643
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,919
go back to the list to dig into um the

644
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,440
binary format and the use cases

645
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,559
i think we're uh lightly enough attended

646
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,679
today

647
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,720
and low energy enough that um

648
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,159
i'm just curious what are we clashing

649
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,919
with during the agenda

650
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,000
on the agenda that uh

651
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,600
it's probably trains people away from us

652
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,039
i know priv probably pulled martin away

653
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,880
yeah so that's that's something we'll

654
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,799
have to make sure we i just this is only

655
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,159
for like the next time we do this to

656
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,679
make sure that i get the

657
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:36,559
um

658
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,678
clashes correct

659
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,600
yeah probably suck yeah

660
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,720
i think though jeffrey it does uh seem

661
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,960
like we're not gonna get any public

662
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,960
comment on these outstanding issues

663
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,559
right now so

664
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,799
propose resolutions on the list is

665
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,399
probably the way to go next

666
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,760
yep

667
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,720
um

668
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,000
and hopefully we'll be in person next

669
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,840
time which will help improve energy

670
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,840
yeah

671
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,158
okay

672
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,880
well sean oh wait felipe has something

673
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,919
to say

674
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,799
please please

675
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,039
yeah one

676
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,360
question that i did want to

677
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,840
ask is about

678
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,640
clarifying the process for the next

679
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,840
steps in the use case document

680
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,360
and basically to see also where

681
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,080
where i can help

682
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,799
you're asking how we make decisions

683
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,080
about what to change in the use cases

684
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,559
document

685
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,760
yeah personally that and also

686
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,679
you know what the new

687
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,880
next steps would be

688
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,880
i believe the next steps are for us to

689
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,039
send a pr uh

690
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,440
reorganizing the use cases document

691
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,960
and then we'll send that that to the

692
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,840
list for comments

693
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,720
yeah that's my understanding as well

694
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,159
that if you if you go ahead and update

695
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,360
the document

696
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,360
and then people will comment then i

697
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,039
think you can engage people will be

698
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,200
engaged to be like yes that one is in or

699
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,559
out that the ones that are still in the

700
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,799
front at the front part of the document

701
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,640
um and then we can actually get to

702
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,120
whether we're done it might be as easy

703
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,559
as just moving things

704
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,080
um and that would be great and then we

705
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,399
could focus our energy elsewhere um i

706
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:43,919
highly doubt that i'm sure this would be

707
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,799
something that's controversial but um i

708
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,480
uh yeah it's basically just reorganize

709
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,600
the document and then we'll go from

710
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,120
there because now it's a working group

711
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,960
document that one of the reasons why you

712
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,399
want to submit the old version the way

713
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,760
it is is so that when you submit the

714
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,519
next version that's the 01 version of

715
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,360
the working group you can see what's

716
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,640
changed as part of the working group

717
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,000
document

718
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,679
process and all that stuff so i think

719
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,600
that uh yeah if you guys can just get

720
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,799
that that

721
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,799
the next version up uh when you're when

722
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,000
when available that would be great

723
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,080
okay thank you yeah then i guess we can

724
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,720
coordinate among ourselves in the

725
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,519
in the coming days

726
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,559
the only thing the only other thing i

727
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,960
would add is just to make sure that uh

728
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,640
you know do it do it in the github so

729
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,919
it's open and people can see what's

730
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,760
going on and if we have any questions we

731
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,840
can just refer them to the list we can

732
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,240
cc the the list we probably should go

733
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,159
ahead and get uh

734
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,480
wpac uh

735
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,399
mailing list set up so there are weekly

736
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,399
summaries sent i think mark nottingham

737
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,640
has a cool tool that'll allow us to do

738
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,039
that and um so that if the

739
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,440
you know the tempo on the mailing list

740
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,519
um or the tempo and the github repo

741
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,039
picks up then the mailing list will

742
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,720
automatically get uh

743
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,240
cc with whatever gets changed

744
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,080
i think

745
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,640
jeffrey popped on to say yes i don't

746
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,960
know exactly but um

747
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,120
sorry yes that's what i said

748
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,399
okay

749
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,760
the audio didn't actually come through

750
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,039
but it was brief enough that i thought

751
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,600
that that was

752
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,240
and uh felipe must have done the same uh

753
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,679
you have to give it a half a second for

754
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,320
the audio actually channel to connect um

755
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,640
but uh sean i think we are probably in

756
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,799
agreement that uh much like we expected

757
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,880
with only needing an hour session

758
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,559
i think that we're gonna be ending early

759
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,559
here at only half an hour right do you

760
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,880
have any other business you need john

761
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,480
i do not the only other thing is to

762
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
think about is that um we do have other

763
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,799
drafts in the working group uh in our

764
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,320
statement of work that we agreed with

765
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,720
the isg and so at some point we'll need

766
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,600
to

767
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,919
begin engaging on those and i guess

768
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,200
there's probably some other things that

769
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,600
need to get done first but um if you

770
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,760
want to start working on those drafts

771
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,640
feel free um you know we basically

772
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,320
will start the process the same way we

773
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,440
did with the other drafts with

774
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,960
individual drafts that we will then

775
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,760
evaluate and you know

776
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,240
run an adoption call on so if there if

777
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,159
any of the other work items that are

778
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,559
available on our that are on our charter

779
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,480
um feel free to jump in there and start

780
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,320
working out

781
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,919
yep that's it for me

782
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,840

783
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,760
