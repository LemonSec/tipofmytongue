all right

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,560
so it's very early in the week and that

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,479
means we need to go through the

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,640
the note well fairly carefully so that

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,040
uh folks understand that as we go into

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,759
the

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,479
uh

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,840
into the meeting

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,680
and um also we um

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,920
uh you know folks will see this all as

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,680
we work along but

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,680
one of the things i like to note is that

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,240
we we all work as individuals

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,320
and we try to be nice to each other here

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,399
in benchmarking methodology working

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,560
group and that's i mean that's not

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,840
unique in in the ietf um but there are

48
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,159
some places where there are uh you know

49
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,280
some very spirited discussions shall we

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,079
say

51
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,520
and um

52
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,159
we we need to uh follow our code of

53
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,520
conduct and

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,639
and uh and and it boils down to this

55
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,280
so uh i hope that uh you know we'll just

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,160
continue on as as we have been

57
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,200
uh in our uh friendly and and um

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,360
a working group where where folks

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,480
recognize

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,959
that uh you know the technical

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,640
arguments are are what we're trying to

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,239
make here and

63
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,360
the best technical argument wins the day

64
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,760
all right so um

65
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,120
you by participating in the itf uh you

66
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,280

69
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,280
any contribution you make it is covered

70
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,160
by the patent uh

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,000

are

79
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,400
are basically anything other than

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,159
sitting on your hands and saying nothing

81
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:08,959
it's

82
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,200
comments you make in the meetings email

if you help out with the minutes

88
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,680
that would be a contribution as well and

89
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,400
it's all covered by our policies

90
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,959
and if you um have any questions about

91
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,720

and also if you if you love to read

97
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,920
about all of these things in the ietf

98
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,840
best current practices

99
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,200
there's a whole list of them here that

100
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,480
you can

101
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,560
check out

102
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,879
so

103
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,599
i think i've seen us through that pretty

104
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,120
well

105
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,159
and now we can move on to the next

106
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,439
point

107
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,760
which is our agenda

108
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,280
and we get to bash the agenda if

109
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,760
necessary but uh here's here's what

110
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,560
we've got uh the working group status

111
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,640
we'll we'll mostly talk about the evpn

112
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,079
draft

113
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,600
then we've got a couple of working group

114
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,160
drafts to talk about

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,360
we've got a working group adoption call

116
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,720
which went uh

117
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,960
i'll say differently than

118
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,000
other adoption calls that we've had and

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,240
we definitely need to talk about that

120
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,320
which is why i didn't compose a message

121
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,840
to the list

122
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,360
further

123
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,160
proposals uh we've got the uh

124
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,479
benchmarking methodology for stateful uh

125
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,720
nat xy gateways

126
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,440
uh using uh the hash and stuffing uh

127
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,919
pseudorandom part numbers uh that was

128
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,800
one of my favorite drafts and rfcs in

129
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,840
this group

130
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,720
and uh and a brand new um what i would

131
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,600
call a considerations draft it's uh uh

132
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,080
in our history it's titled the problems

133
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
and requirements of evaluation

134
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,240
methodology for integrated space and

135
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,880
terrestrial networks uh that's biting

136
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,960
off a lot and but we're going to hear

137
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,320
about it today

138
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,880
in the time available

139
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,880
so any bashes to the agenda

140
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,479
all right

141
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,280
i see no requests for the floor

142
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,560
um

143
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,800
can can somebody help me out with the

144
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,039
note taking today

145
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,360
and and of course the way you do that is

146
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,720
uh with the note taking tool

147
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,000
and

148
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,759
the note-taking tool

149
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,680
has already been populated with the

150
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,960
agenda

151
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,000
and

152
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,520
the various topics we're going to talk

153
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,919
about so it would actually be very easy

154
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,240
to do it's just something that you have

155
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
to um

156
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,800
capture our agreements at the end of

157
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,840
discussion

158
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,319
uh if there's a big question

159
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,120
and a big answer that follows uh

160
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,520
then um would be nice to capture that as

161
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,319
well

162
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,120
uh but otherwise um

163
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,680
we'll do the best we can here

164
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,280
and as i said sarah is going to join us

165
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,560
a little bit late

166
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,199
can i can i get a volunteer to help out

167
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,840
with the minutes

168
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,880
all right

169
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,560
well i hope um i'm gonna ask that

170
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,960
question again shortly

171
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,440
and uh hope that we can

172
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,199
move along here a bit

173
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,720
so basically

174
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,759
our uh brief uh benchmarking working

175
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,840
group status is um

176
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,919
uh the uh ethernet vpn draft that went

177
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,080
up to iesg review

178
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,000
uh quite some time ago

179
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,360
uh received uh five disgust ballots

180
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,199
uh which are blocking

181
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,960
uh ballots

182
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,520
and uh they need to be resolved by the

183
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,240
authors um one of the authors basically

184
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,319
said that that they were working on

185
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,400
resolving the comments but then

186
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,599
uh

187
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,440
he was looking for his co-author to

188
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,479
agree

189
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,840
and and then

190
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,360
not much happened so um warren uh

191
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,120
imposed a deadline of october 31st where

192
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,560
where we would

193
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,240
declare the document

194
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,720
dead if there was no progress

195
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,759
and unfortunately october 31st came and

196
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,800
went

197
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,280
and um

198
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,039
we have seen

199
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,960
no progress on this

200
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,160
so um

201
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,759
warren um

202
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,720
um

203
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,599
i'm gonna uh ask you to sort of step

204
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,680
forward here and uh looks like you're

205
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,280
joining the queue

206
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,850
i think where is that

207
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,479
[Music]

208
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,280
where's the queue

209
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,759
did you join the queue yep the queue is

210
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,639
um

211
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,160
under the

212
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
list of under the participant list which

213
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,520
is to the right oh yes good thank you

214
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,680
um well yeah i mean

215
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,400
i don't really want the document to die

216
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,080
but we've been waiting on the authors

217
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
for a really really long time and i

218
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,680
can't seem to get a hold of them i've

219
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,759
sent them a bunch of mails

220
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,440
both through the data tracker and

221
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,520
directly and similar

222
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,399
so i'm not sure if the working group

223
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,839
wants to

224
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,599
add some additional

225
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,599
authors who might be willing to help

226
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,000
deal with the discussed positions

227
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,679
or what

228
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,839
um

229
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,240
i mean i'm okay even in its current

230
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,839
state a bit longer but i would really

231
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,200
really really like to see it moving

232
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,800
along just because it shows up as a big

233
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,120
red thing and data tracker keeps sending

234
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,000
me grumpy emails

235
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,440
yeah i think that's i mean

236
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,560
to cover all the bases i i like your

237
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,480
suggestion of

238
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,080
asking if there's anyone else in the

239
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,080
working group who would like to pick

240
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,120
this uh pick this work up and and deal

241
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,720
with the um

242
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,959
uh disgust ballots

243
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,880
um

244
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,160
i know that you know one of the uh

245
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,360
one of the authors has lost his place

246
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,240
and i saw another announcement too that

247
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,640
led me to believe that maybe uh maybe

248
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,120
the second author had the same problem

249
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,600
so um

250
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,760
we'll we'll have to see uh

251
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,440
whether whether anyone is willing to

252
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,640
take this up

253
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,560
and um yeah i i propose uh when sarah

254
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,399
rejoins us um or joins us uh maybe at

255
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,920
the end of the meeting let's let's

256
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,440
revisit this

257
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,800
and uh

258
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,360
and discuss it then oh sarah's here good

259
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,000
hi sarah

260
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,720
i think she's still maybe maybe she's

261
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,839
still in the process of joining

262
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,040
so i i guess she might also just be

263
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,880
looking for her microphone thing so i

264
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,720
guess we'll quickly yeah

265
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
give her the summary of what we've

266
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,360
gotten to

267
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,519
so specifically on the sarah

268
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,320
specifically on the ebpn draft

269
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,200
i mean i'd sort of said by october 31st

270
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,600
if nothing happens is going to

271
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,120
going to market dead

272
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,800
and we haven't managed to reach the

273
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,120
authors but i really really really don't

274
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,720
want to market dead

275
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
so at the moment i think we're trying to

276
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,240
see if there's anybody else who wants to

277
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,959
volunteer to step forward and

278
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,800
sort of help carry the document over the

279
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,240
finish line

280
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,519
um

281
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,200
i've sent probably

282
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,120
five or six attempts through the data

283
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,800
tracker to reach the authors and then

284
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,399
once on the list with a somewhat passive

285
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,560
aggressive you all need to do stuff for

286
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,800
al or our market dead and also about

287
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,000
seven or eight

288
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,600
off list emails

289
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,360
with with no luck

290
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,040
um

291
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,320
so

292
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,079
apart from actually just getting all of

293
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,839
the comments addressed there's also

294
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,680
going to be the problem of

295
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,440
at auth 48th

296
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,240
time

297
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,760
we need

298
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,480
um all of the authors to acknowledge

299
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,240
that they're okay with the changes so we

300
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,839
do still need to reach them in some

301
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,160
manner

302
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,560
but i'm not sure if

303
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,279
you can speak yet

304
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,720
okay

305
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,560
so hopefully sarah has more like

306
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,120
managing to reach the authors than i did

307
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,440
um i got some bounces and the rest of

308
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,720
them just sort of seemed to disappear

309
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,160
into a black hole

310
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,519
so yeah

311
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,680
yeah

312
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,920
okay and

313
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,839
interestingly oh let's see

314
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,279
here oh okay

315
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,360
oh yeah i i was trying to take some

316
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,200
notes and now i figured out how to do it

317
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,880
so um

318
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,120
uh

319
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,200
so the i mean the the real so the real

320
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,120
question is uh whether

321
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,839
whether anyone

322
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,680
anyone

323
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,839
else in the group

324
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,480
will

325
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,440
help

326
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,480
with

327
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,839
this

328
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,480
and that's the

329
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,120
discuss

330
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,560
and

331
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,600
off

332
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,360
48

333
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
okay

334
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,839
all right

335
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,519
all attempts

336
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,360
to reach authors have failed

337
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,480
okay

338
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,680
all right

339
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,360
so um

340
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,839
i you know i i can i can certainly

341
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,360
remember that sarah's always had some

342
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,120
difficulty getting the

343
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,399
real-time media going so let's see uh

344
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,800
let's see how that works out

345
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,639
um

346
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,279
good but thank you for that uh

347
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,440
suggestion warren i i think we'll we'll

348
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,920
try that and as a last ditch effort and

349
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,800
then

350
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,320
let you know what happened maybe a

351
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,079
couple weeks

352
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,320
request see if see if this is important

353
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,920
enough for anybody else to pick up

354
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,040
okay

355
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,120
so um

356
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,760
on the uh on the next generation uh

357
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,120
firewall uh actually this is i mean

358
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,680
this is just our status part of this uh

359
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,240
we've we had our last uh

360
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,079
uh working group class call on this the

361
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,079
comments were resolved went on to the

362
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,360
document shefford shepard and um

363
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,279
we need some things uh

364
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,440
added to the latest version of the draft

365
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,600
based on the shepard's review which is

366
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,320
me

367
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,800
so that's the status there

368
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,600
we got a lot of new comments on multiple

369
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,839
loss ratio search which is the other new

370
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,760
working group document and of course the

371
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,600
proposals keep going

372
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,639
so

373
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,440
that's

374
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,040
uh that's where we

375
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,079
stand in general uh in the working group

376
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,959
uh we've got no new rfcs

377
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,120
we've uh we've had a nice stable charter

378
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,440
for about four years and and uh we like

379
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,000
it that way so um

380
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
unless anybody's got problems with the

381
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,760
current charter we'll uh just leave it

382
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,880
as is

383
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,680
and we have a supplementary bmw g

384
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,519
webpage that i haven't visited in a

385
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,560
while but i hope it's still reachable

386
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,160
so um

387
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,240
brian brian monkman

388
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,000

389
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,440

yes i can brian go ahead okay good good

392
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,480
um quick question um first off our

393
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,000
apologies we totally missed the

394
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,639
attachment when uh when when you sent it

395
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,600
out i mean all all of us did so i'm not

396
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,199
too sure what happened there but we

397
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,079
reviewed it and um everything makes

398
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,639
makes total sense

399
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,440
the one question i do have is should we

400
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,399
um

401
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,399
create a new version

402
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,000
uh before uh go before the um it gets

403
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
passed over to the area director for

404
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,079
review or should we wait until

405
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,279
we get the area director comments back

406
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,920
what should we do

407
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,480
let's let's um i i suggest that let's

408
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,120
send warren our cleanest uh version

409
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,320
possible

410
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,639
and then um i mean they're basically all

411
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,480
editorial things the only you know the

412
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,560
only one that i thought would involve

413
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,600
some work

414
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,920
uh was checking one of the references to

415
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,800
see if an updated version could be used

416
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,160
uh and that came out of the nits check

417
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,360
right

418
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,759
right but um yeah that's pretty sure

419
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,440
it's pretty pretty straightforward but

420
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,560
uh

421
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,440
okay fair enough i'll um

422
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
once i think we have have something i

423
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,279
mean if we're going to um

424
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,360
if we're going to change the the

425
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,759
references to something you know newer

426
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,040
then we should probably just do

427
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,000
everything

428
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,839
and then um so it's it's done and we

429
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,440
could uh pass it on uh with with

430
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,040
with all of your comments addressed

431
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,560
good

432
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,120
good and then i'll um

433
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,720
push the button there's a there's a

434
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,079
button to request a uh

435
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,399
you know publication request and that's

436
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,880
when warren gets it for his review

437
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,079
and um we'll take it from there

438
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,720
okay all right i'll send you an eta once

439
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,519
uh once i have that finalized

440
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,920
that's great thank you okay great all

441
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,279
right

442
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,079
well that so that covers the

443
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,480
that covers the

444
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,680
uh

445
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,760
next generation firewall part of our our

446
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,119
agenda and um it it's i've mentioned

447
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,640
this a couple of times it's important to

448
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,400
include that uh obsolete 3511 in the

449
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,520
abstract

450
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,919
uh it's just the way thing it's just the

451
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,799
way people do things

452
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,599
so uh let's do that

453
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,799
all right

454
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,119
and let's see here

455
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,799
um so the authors will will will do that

456
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,039
and

457
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
admits

458
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,960
okay

459
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,520
all right

460
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,840
so

461
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,760
then we've got another status here which

462
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,799
is basically the multiple uh

463
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,200
loss ratio search

464
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,440
and um

465
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,480
yeah what i want to do there is is uh

466
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,559
i'll i'll basically share my screen

467
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,760
which is going to be a little different

468
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,080
than this let me go away from

469
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,280
the slide share

470
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,280
and then i'll do the

471
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,600
screen share

472
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,919
yes i do

473
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,200
and i want here

474
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,189
[Music]

475
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,440
well i'm guessing

476
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,240
i'm guessing this is really small

477
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,720
uh the my notepad here

478
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,240
uh is that

479
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,320
is that the general impression folks in

480
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,919
in the audience should i make this try

481
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,640
to make this bigger

482
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,440
and that's of course not going to do it

483
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,330
alone but

484
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,889
[Music]

485
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,679
uh

486
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,880
what's my font size thing

487
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:11,760
well

488
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,960
you know

489
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,919
it might actually be

490
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,480
yeah it's actually more visible here so

491
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,400
um

492
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,360
for

493
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,679
and this is the this is the notepad uh

494
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,760
that i mentioned before in the editing

495
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,559
mode

496
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,600
um

497
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,039
so uh on the multiple loss ratio search

498
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,320
um

499
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,679
mossyack

500
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,640
posted a status late last week

501
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,400
and

502
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,360
what we've uh what we've also got is um

503
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,280
some comments that have been

504
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,320
uh made by

505
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
gabor and

506
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,480
verrattko has been commenting uh or sort

507
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,640
of responding to those comments so we've

508
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,440
gotten we've gotten some reviews uh and

509
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,840
then vladimir posted comments over the

510
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,960
weekend

511
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,559
so that's great i know they haven't had

512
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,360
a chance to uh to respond to those uh a

513
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,240
flat but uh it appears that there's

514
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,000
plenty of material for

515
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,799
um the authors to take back and consider

516
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,400
and and work on an update of this uh of

517
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,039
this particular uh document and we've

518
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,280
had you know we've had lots of uh

519
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,520
discussion of this thing on its way to

520
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,760
working group adoption so i think that's

521
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,840
uh you know it this is this is a

522
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,880
document that's that's on its way uh so

523
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,039
we're just looking forward to uh

524
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,200
uh

525
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,960
update

526
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,360
o2

527
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,840
to reflect

528
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,000
comments

529
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,320
okay

530
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,480
all right

531
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,200
so any other and any further comments on

532
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,320
on

533
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,360
either of these drafts

534
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,720
you know we've gone through these pretty

535
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,760
heavily

536
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,080
uh we're

537
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,200
you know

538
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,159
developing a multiple loss ratio search

539
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,520
uh toward uh

540
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,360
uh you know toward a working group last

541
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,480
call we've had many last calls on the

542
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,640
security device performance

543
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,520
and um i think we can be happy with uh

544
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,000
with what we've accomplished with

545
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,600
both of these so far

546
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,480
we'll see a little more

547
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,200
we'll see a little more work on uh on

548
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,960
both of them before we

549
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,840
uh send them on

550
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,360
all right

551
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,400
so we're making good time here um

552
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,640
during the interim period between our

553
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,919
our session

554
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:46,799
at

555
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,960
itf 111 and ietf 112

556
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,240
we had a working group adoption review

557
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,880
for the yang model

558
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,559
a young data model for network

559
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,000
interconnect

560
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,159
tester management

561
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,440
and

562
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,799
you can see the document is is here it's

563
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,799
been updated

564
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,480
october 25th

565
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,340
thanks to the author for his um

566
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,600
[Music]

567
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,039
for his update

568
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,480
and um

569
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,000
this is what i meant when i said that

570
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,840
the working group adoption uh was a

571
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,360
little bit unusual with this uh uh we we

572
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,880
got some there were some comments in

573
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,760
september early september when i when i

574
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,760
started the adoption call

575
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,559
uh tom petch

576
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,960
basically wrote in an objection

577
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,240
but um

578
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,960
it seemed to be a manageable

579
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,400
uh of objection about the um

580
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,919
the prefixes to some of the names and uh

581
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,320
jurgen schoenwalder had

582
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,600
many comments uh including uh this

583
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,120
comment about the status but um

584
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,080
just checking here

585
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,799
oh yeah uh vlad uh

586
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,480
you know i've i've done a little

587
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,799
summarizing here already but i i'd be

588
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,960
glad to invite you to the microphone to

589
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,559
uh

590
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,080
to add some additional detail

591
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,520
hi

592
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,720
do you hear me

593
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,159
yes i can hear you

594
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,000
yeah i

595
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,880
i think the the summary that you did is

596
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,320
precise

597
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,880
and uh i don't think

598
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,919
we can

599
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,760
add the words right now the the comments

600
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,080
from you again are something that the

601
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,760
work you can

602
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,360
can work with

603
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,440
and decide upon

604
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,400
tom's

605
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,200
objection was as you said many jeru and

606
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,760
i think also the work group will have

607
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,039
the say about if we modify the prefixes

608
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,000
further

609
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,279
but

610
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,200
at least we have two people that have

611
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,240
read the drafts in detail

612
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,360
and uh i i don't see any explicit

613
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,120
support anyone

614
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,720
who has uh

615
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,840
has done that so that's a bit

616
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,480
unfortunate

617
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,279
but

618
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,360
i think a lot of people have read the

619
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,600
draft and no one has come with some

620
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,880
obvious

621
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,559
objection that

622
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,120
that proves this draft

623
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,200
not to be a work group item so this is

624
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,559
positive

625
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,600
that's what i have to say

626
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,000
good thanks thanks i i appreciate you

627
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,159
joining us today to add that and um

628
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,600
so

629
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,880
then

630
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,760
the next question i want to talk about

631
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,880
in particular is this uh

632
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,640
this idea of the

633
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,440
changing the status uh to standards

634
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,480
track

635
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,679
um i i i have to agree that if we're

636
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,480
going to have a yang model as uh jorgen

637
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,440
uh

638
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,320
said

639
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,720
uh then it should be a standard track

640
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,159
model like the rest of the yang models

641
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,480
and the the big surprise here

642
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,880
is um that we've never produced a

643
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,960
standards track document

644
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,120
in the benchmarking methodology working

645
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,080
group

646
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,279
um

647
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,720
that's because

648
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,440
all we've produced up to this point

649
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,400
is

650
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,600
um you know considerations drafts

651
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,960
and uh terms and and uh definitions

652
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,080
drafts terminology basically and then

653
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,919
methodology drafts where we talk about

654
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,240
the procedures and and so forth but

655
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,880
there was um at the time

656
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,559
the benchmarking methodology working

657
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,799
group started there was no real way to

658
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,679
move

659
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,080
uh material like that along the

660
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,400
standards track

661
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,520
that's no longer necessarily true but we

662
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,000
haven't had much interest in following

663
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,840
um what the uh ip performance metrics uh

664
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,279
working group did uh which is to

665
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,440
test implementations of the the rfcs for

666
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,640
their

667
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,799
you know their measurement equivalents

668
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,679
uh

669
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,120
you know back when we were working on

670
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,279
that heavily in in the ip performance

671
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,360
metrics working group i opened that

672
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,440
possibility up to uh

673
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,360
to this working group and and

674
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,279
didn't get a lot of takers so we've

675
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,919
continued on with the informational

676
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,080
drafts

677
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,159
so i i i'd like to propose

678
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,039
uh two things

679
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,640
and

680
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,480
that we

681
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,600
were so we're discussing the the

682
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,159
adoption outcome now i think it's clear

683
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,200
that we need a yang doctor uh to work

684
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,720
with us uh work with bmwg

685
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,640
uh on this

686
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,679
and uh that's a question for uh warren

687
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,000
really d do you agree warren that uh

688
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,679
that would be helpful and maybe you can

689
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,840
help us get a yang doctor assigned

690
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,480
but i will try and find a young doctor i

691
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,720
mean if anybody in the working group is

692
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,159
already

693
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,080
somebody who you know has a lot of

694
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,840
experience with yang

695
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,840
maybe they can be the initial person and

696
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,279
then i can also try and find somebody

697
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,720
from ops awg or young doctors to to help

698
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,880
out

699
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
yeah so i think i think that's that's

700
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,840
one of the problems that we we don't

701
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,880
have a lot of um

702
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,440
yang expertise here

703
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,919
in bmwg

704
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,640
and um

705
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,399
so we should at least have a uh

706
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,159
you know like a yang doctor to uh advise

707
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,559
um

708
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,960
if you know if given that um

709
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,000
uh

710
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,320
the comments that came back in in

711
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,039
adoption were you know very specific

712
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,320
uh

713
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,840
yang comments

714
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,679
and uh and not so much on the

715
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,320
benchmarking aspect which you know which

716
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,240
which those of us who have looked at it

717
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,919
seem to be okay with so uh it's

718
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,240
we we need this additional perspective i

719
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,120
think

720
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
and um

721
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,520
so that's i mean that's one part of this

722
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,799
and um

723
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,159
i i think

724
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,080
i think we should probably do another

725
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,320
short uh working group adoption call

726
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,640
specifically mention

727
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,559
mentioning that this is a

728
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,559
that this would be adopted as a

729
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,320
standards track

730
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,320
document

731
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,720
so that's that would then be the

732
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,159
question

733
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,159
uh another question for the working

734
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,399
group

735
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,840
so any any comments on that

736
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,360
i agree with that

737
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,520
that the new

738
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,919
call can be

739
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,919
started

740
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,679
i'm i'm sorry i'm sorry vlad i missed uh

741
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,919
i think i missed what you said there

742
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,279
yeah i agree with uh with you that a new

743
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,840
adoption call needs to be started so

744
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,799
that the formal part of it is

745
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,960
met because this one was for information

746
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,000
so i agree with that

747
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,399
okay

748
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,200
and this is warren i had a quick skim of

749
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,960
the chart and i don't see anything that

750
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,039
says that we can't do standards track

751
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,679
but we should triple check that

752
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,279
um

753
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,640
yeah i think that's true i i um

754
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,600
i i've never used i've never used that

755
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,080
terminology in the in the charter

756
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,279
although um you know i've i think i've

757
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,120
i've said a number of times in the

758
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,120
document shepard's form that

759
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,240
uh bmwg has only produced informational

760
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,840
documents so far

761
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,840
uh you know i just basically have to

762
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,559
stop saying that in the in the shepherds

763
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,760
form

764
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,240
that's all

765
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,440
all right

766
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,240
well

767
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,799
then um

768
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,120
uh

769
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,960
given that we uh

770
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,799
i i i think

771
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,559
i think the yang doctor part of this is

772
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,200
important so um

773
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,159
uh i mean alongs so alongside the new

774
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,919
working group adoption

775
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,039
um

776
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,480
should we uh cross post this uh adoption

777
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,360
call to uh another uh working group to

778
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,840
try to get a yang doctor to help us

779
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,760
like uh i don't know net mod

780
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,960
cc ops awg and i guess

781
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,320
netmod

782
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,360
i guess

783
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,399
but there is also the young doctors abs

784
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,640
which i think is just young doctors and

785
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,919
if we

786
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,640
um cc that that would probably also help

787
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
but i can also just ask robert to please

788
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,679
find us

789
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,159
a young person to help yeah yeah uh and

790
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,559
that that last one was was

791
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,399
uh cc uh yang

792
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,960

sarah says i also agree i thought the ch

804
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,360
i thought our charter had at one point

805
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,799
said something about information but

806
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,480

methodology for stateful n80 xy gate

856
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,359
phase where xy means uh four or six

857

as you find as you want

858

and the specialty of this draft is uh

859
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,400
that we also consider the seven random

860
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,480
port numbers could you go to the next

861
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,200
slide please

862
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,920
so i presented the draft at the last

863
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,320
ietf meeting and now i would just just

864
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,480
give a short reminder for those who were

865
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,880
present and a very short introduction

866
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,040
for those who were not present

867
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,160
so

868
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,160
this methodology works with any ip

869
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,480
versions but for

870
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,280
easy for easy understanding i used ip

871
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,040
version 4 other cs

872
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,320
and in this

873
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,920
drawing you can see the tester and the

874
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,400
device in the test that's in general

875
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,240
test setup from rfc 2544

876
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,720
however the situation now is a bit

877
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,280
more complicated because

878
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,079
you can see that on the left side

879
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,040
there are

880
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,359
private ip addresses and on the right

881
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,760
side the public ipv version for

882
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,119
addresses

883
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,480
and of course

884
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,960
if the tester from the left to the right

885
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,440
would like to send some uh test frames

886
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,880
through the device and the test it's no

887
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,760
problem it can use any uh

888
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,320
port numbers and just send a frame

889
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,160
through and it's a duty of the device on

890
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,040
the test the stateful let's say an 84

891
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,119
for gateway that it

892
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,079
performs the translation uh changes the

893
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,480
let's say the source ip version for

894
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,280
address and if necessary it also changes

895
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,400
the

896
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,960
port numbers and sends out the frame and

897
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,640
of course the

898
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
tester on the right side will receive

899
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,520
the frame all right and

900
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,040
if it was a

901
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,359
frame belonging to a new uh not yet seen

902
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,400
session then the device in the test

903
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,079
store the session in the connection

904
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,880
tracking table and when they responded

905
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,760
when the tester receives this frame it

906
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,880
also

907
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,839
extracts the ip addresses and port

908
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,880
numbers and it also stores the four type

909
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,440
of i mean the source and destination

910
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,359
ipad addresses and port numbers into its

911
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,240
states table because then it would like

912
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,040
to

913
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,760
send a frame in the reverse direction

914
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,040
from right to the left through the

915
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,760
device under test it just cannot invent

916
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,800
arbitrary port numbers but it has to use

917
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,440
evade uh for tumble and of course change

918
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,480
source and destination and then it can

919
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,240
can send a test frame through the device

920
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,079
on the test which belongs to an existing

921
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,320
connection and thus the

922
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,359
stateful nat gateway is able to

923
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,560
translate its addresses and port numbers

924
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,800
and forward back

925
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,400
so this is how it works

926
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,079
and uh so you have seen uh so far one

927
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,079
thing that uh the right side of the

928
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,720
tester just may not invent uh port

929
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,599
numbers but have to have to know has a

930
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,160
knowledge uh stay stable about the port

931
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,920
numbers which can be used and there's

932
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,280
another thing it's in relationship with

933
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,440
rfc

934
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,240
4814 that it recommended the user usage

935
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,040
of random port numbers so even

936
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,880
from the left to the right you may not

937
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,079
not just use arbitrary uh number of port

938
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,400
number combinations because it would

939
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,880
would have been denier service attack

940
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,119
against the connection tracking table of

941
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,280
the device under test so we have to

942
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,160
limit the port number ranges both the

943
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,839
source and extension upon number edges

944
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,320
to a smaller range

945
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,440
so that

946
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,280
all the combinations

947
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,400
should be limited number and not exhaust

948
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,359
the connection tracking table

949
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,640
could you go to the next slide please

950
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,480
thank you

951
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,920
and how a measurement happens so

952
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,480
we invented a preliminary phase which

953
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,119
happens before the real test phase and

954
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,079
in this

955
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,320
phase uh the

956
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,480
last left part of the

957
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,960
test which was called initiator sends

958
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,200
primary frames uh to the through the

959
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,920
doot to the right side of the tester

960
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,800
and

961
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,880
two things happened during this primary

962
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,760
phase

963
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,560
uh

964
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,320
the connection tagging table of the

965
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,280
device under test is filled with valid

966
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,400
uh connections and also the state table

967
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,160
of the responder part of the tester is

968
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,119
filled with these four samples

969
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,920
and after that

970
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,720
there may come a real test phase but

971
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,200
it's not always that situation

972
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,160
because if we would like to measure the

973
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,520
maximum connection connection

974
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,680
establishment rate then we just use the

975
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,079
primary phase and we just make a binary

976
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,040
search to find the highest rate at which

977
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,200
all the

978
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,960
frames test frames which initiate a new

979
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,720
connection are forwarded and

980
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,160
successfully right back to the tester

981
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,040
and of course uh our traditional tests

982
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,000
such as

983
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,040
throughput framelessly etc are

984
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,040
done in the real test phase

985
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,960
which must be preceded by a perimeter

986
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,440
space so this is the the measurement

987
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
method in short

988
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,240
and

989
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,959
could you go to the next

990
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,560
slide thank you so uh this method was

991
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,720
presented already at the last ietf

992
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,440
meeting and since then uh we have uh

993
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,319
made two new versions version zero one

994
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,119
uh

995
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,560
includes the

996
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,280
comments uh on the mailing list before

997
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,240
the last iitf meeting and zero version

998
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,319
two uh

999
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,880
includes some interesting improvement or

1000
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,599
refinement of methodology because uh i

1001
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,440
have made a lot of measurements

1002
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,400
for the

1003
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,200
ip version 6 operations working group

1004
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,920
for this draft you can see here and in

1005
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,480
that measurements i used an

1006
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,440
ip

1007
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,720
table happy tables as a state for n84

1008
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,839
for implementation and i did two kind of

1009
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,880
scalability tests so in the first test

1010
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,960
series i used one two four eight and 16

1011
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,319
cpu cores and i examined how the

1012
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,480
performance of ip tables scaled up with

1013
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,319
the number of cpu cores and in the

1014
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,079
second test series

1015
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,720
i used a different number of connections

1016
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,640
in the connection tracking table and i

1017
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,800
examined how the performance of ip

1018
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,720
tables degraded

1019
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,400
with high number of connections such as

1020
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,359
one

1021
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,640
100 million 400 million even 800 million

1022
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,000
connections in the connection tracking

1023
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,599
table

1024
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,280
and

1025
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,400
during this

1026
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,560
experience

1027
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,280
i

1028
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,800
have had some more insight how the

1029
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,760
method should work and

1030
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,640
uh using this experience we have reverb

1031
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,000
section 4.3 and made some changes also

1032
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,040
in

1033
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,920
4.4 and as

1034
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,280
al wrote a few days ago uh

1035
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,839
i should have changed some other parts

1036
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,000
and i will update those parts also

1037
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,280
because there became some

1038
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,200
inconsistencies but now i would like to

1039
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,319
talk about section 4.3

1040
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,599
could you go to next slide please

1041
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,319
thank you

1042
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,839
so our experience has shown that uh

1043
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,480
there's a significant difference between

1044
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,599
the processing power necessary for a

1045
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,680
test frame when it generates a new

1046
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,599
connection and when it doesn't generate

1047
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,920
a new connection uh in the connect on

1048
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,359
the contact table

1049
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,000
of the device and the test and what is

1050
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,520
even worse

1051
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,640
uh we have experienced that

1052
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,160
if i fill the connection tracking table

1053
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,480
and it requires a given amount of time

1054
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,839
its depletion requires even more time

1055
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,800
so it's a problem if some connections

1056
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,960
are time out and some new connections

1057
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,000
are established during the test because

1058
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,960
their

1059
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,760
proportion may significantly uh

1060
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,599
influence the results of let's say

1061
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,240
throughput tested oil tests so for this

1062
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,319
motivation uh

1063
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,800
i think we managed to make the

1064
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,720
measurement process purchase such as a

1065
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,960
procedure more clean and i would like to

1066
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
explain it in the next slide will you go

1067
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,760
to the next slide please

1068
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,839
yes so the consequence is that

1069
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,000
we can ensure two

1070
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,680
extreme situations

1071
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,440
and they can be ensured easily and

1072
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,359
unfortunately i must say that

1073
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,760
i cannot ensure any other situations

1074
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,440
easily so

1075
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,720
the first

1076
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,520
exam situation is when all test frames

1077
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,599
create a new connection and this is

1078
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,280
ideal for measuring the maximum

1079
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,200
connection establishment rate

1080
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,400
and the second situation is when test

1081
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,640
frames never create a new connection of

1082
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,800
course uh i understand it for the second

1083
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,720
phase for the real test phase

1084
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,800
and this idea for the throughput latency

1085
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,920
and all other traditional tests

1086
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,160
and due to blackbox testing

1087
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,160
i must say that we are not able to

1088
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,400
ensure other situations in between for

1089
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,440
example it would be natural to say

1090
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,920
let's say 10 of the new test trains keys

1091
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,160
in your connection and 90 percent uh

1092
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,640
belong to the existing connection but i

1093
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,440
cannot kind of do that because uh of

1094
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,319
blackboard testing so the tester is not

1095
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,960
able to examine uh the connection

1096
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,960
tracking table of the data under test

1097
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,920
for this reason uh i don't see a good

1098
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,319
chance to to implement such kind of

1099
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,000
tests just the two extremes

1100
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,200
okay and how to how to ensure this these

1101
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,599
two extreme situations

1102
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,240
i will cover this in the next slides

1103
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,279
could you go to next slide please

1104
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,920
so uh before

1105
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,760
the method how to ensure that two excel

1106
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,800
situations we make some assumptions

1107
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,839
uh the first assumption is just for

1108
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,119
simplicity

1109
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,359
uh it is that a singular source

1110
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,880
addressed and destination despair is

1111
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,880
used for all tests i know that uh rfc

1112
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,160
2544 requires also testing with 256

1113
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,079
different destination networks but

1114
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,960
currently we do not support it uh they

1115
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,440
could be supported but for simplicity we

1116
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,880
don't deal with that now

1117
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,359
and another assumption is that the

1118
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,520
connection taking table of the stateful

1119
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,359
nat xy device is large enough to store

1120
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,880
all the connections

1121
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,200
defined by the different source port

1122
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,200
number destination port number

1123
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,880
combinations

1124
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,079
so it is

1125
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,079
something to be ensured uh by the one

1126
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:48,960
who

1127
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,480
performs the test and if it's if ensured

1128
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,440
then

1129
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,920
all other things can be ensured easily

1130
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,640
could you go to the next slide

1131
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,720
so excellent situation one which is uh

1132
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,720
for measuring the maximum conduction

1133
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,599
establishment rate is that we need to

1134
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,880
ensure that all test frames initiate a

1135
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,319
new connection in the connection

1136
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,119
tracking table so it

1137
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,359
just for the first phase the primary

1138
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:24,720
phase and it's very easy because we must

1139
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,880
use all different source port number

1140
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,560
destination port number combinations in

1141
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,920
the primary phase and uh we

1142
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,280
also need to ensure that the udp timeout

1143
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,839
of the gateway is higher than the length

1144
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,359
of the duration of the premier phase

1145
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:44,800
of course if

1146
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,280
some connections would time out

1147
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,400
the new combinations would still result

1148
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,760
in in

1149
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,680
new

1150
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,079
connections but we must ensure that no

1151
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,160
connections time out because timing of

1152
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,119
the connections would impose some uh

1153
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,560
processing power

1154
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,280
need so we would like to do not like to

1155
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,400
disturb

1156
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,520
the measurement uh with some some

1157
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,440
timeouts and and the deletions of

1158
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,520
connections that's why we need to ensure

1159
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,240
that connections are not deleted

1160
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,880
and this is enough for the measurement

1161
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,480
of the maximum connection establishment

1162
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,160
rate could you go to the next slide

1163
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,480
and now comes the most interesting thing

1164
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,319
uh we would like to perform the

1165
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,680
traditional measurements such as

1166
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,440
throughput and frame low slate and

1167
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,079
latency etc so how can we do that

1168
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,480
this is these are the conditions

1169
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,160
so uh in the prima preliminary phase

1170
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,400
we use all different source port number

1171
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,839
destination port number combinations and

1172
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:52,640
in the preliminary phase we enumerate

1173
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,400
all possible source point number and

1174
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,720
decision point number combinations

1175
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,960
of course this arranged for source ports

1176
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,839
and destination ports and

1177
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,559
we decide determine the ranges that

1178
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,599
all the combinations can be anime can be

1179
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,079
can be exhausted so no more

1180
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,079
combinations remain

1181
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,400
for this reason in the

1182
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,599
second stage in the real test phase

1183
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,760
no more

1184
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,240
new combinations may occur and of course

1185
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,800
you must set the udp timeout of the

1186
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,040
gateway to a value higher than the sum

1187
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,599
of these three values here this is the

1188
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,520
length of the preliminary phase and the

1189
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,280
gap between the two phases and the

1190
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,200
length of the real test phase

1191
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,760
and if we ensure that then in the real

1192
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,119
test phase

1193
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,720
we will have

1194
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,440
no new connections no timeouts

1195
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,680
and all test frames will belong to

1196
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,680
existing connections

1197
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,960
so it it

1198
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,720
makes testing more simple because

1199
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,559
this spring when i made some some other

1200
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,359
tests i had to have to

1201
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:58,400
take care

1202
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,200
if things were time out or not timeout

1203
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,440
and refresh

1204
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,960
the connections

1205
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,319
uh by

1206
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,920
private practically scanning the

1207
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,520
connection the the state table of the

1208
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,480
device of the tester but now this this

1209
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,240
high time mode uh eliminates all other

1210
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,440
troubles and i think in this way these

1211
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,359
two measurements these two types of

1212
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,680
measurements can be executed in a way

1213
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,280
that they produce uh i think meaningful

1214
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,319
and especially repeatable results so

1215
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,520
could you go to the next slide

1216
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,760
thank you

1217
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,400
and of course some considerations

1218
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,160
regarding the southern random port

1219
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,359
numbers

1220
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,880
earlier

1221
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,559
i have made also some tests uh when i

1222
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:49,920
enumerated the

1223
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,160
port number combinations in increasing

1224
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,559
order i mean that uh let's say that

1225
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,480
let's take the source point attestation

1226
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,119
on port numbers and make a four digit

1227
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,000
number and of course uh there are some

1228
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,559
some bad and invite combinations i i

1229
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:06,640
just uh eliminated the valid

1230
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,200
combinations in increasing order

1231
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,800
but i experienced that when i uh

1232
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,440
enumerate all the combinations in a

1233
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,720
random order and if i animate them in an

1234
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,640
increasing order the result is not the

1235
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,880
same and

1236
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,839
it's

1237
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:27,359
probably some uh

1238
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,960
uh

1239
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,400
special things in ip tables but i

1240
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,480
experienced that was there really a

1241
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,440
significant difference so uh southern

1242
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,480
random enumeration is is a must and of

1243
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,920
course we may use a linear increasing

1244
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,880
enumeration also an editorial metric but

1245
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,880
epsilon random

1246
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,359
animation is a must and of course uh

1247
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,599
there's a good algorithm for that so we

1248
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:54,880
can

1249
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,559
use that stanford's random shuffle

1250
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:00,480
algorithm it means that we just emulate

1251
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,160
all the port number combinations in an

1252
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,240
area and then

1253
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,880
make the random shuffle and then we have

1254
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,119
all the port numbers and during the test

1255
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,720
we just read the array in the in the uh

1256
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,960
tester so we have i invented that it

1257
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,280
works perfectly in just a few seconds

1258
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,960
before the real test and then may come

1259
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,440
the real test and it works good

1260
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,400
so

1261
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,559
that's all and if you go to go the next

1262
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:25,680
slide

1263
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,640
i will have some questions there

1264
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,760
so

1265
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,440
so far i have

1266
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,800
told what we can do and my question is

1267
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,640
what do you think about it

1268
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,879
so

1269
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,640
do you think that

1270
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,000
it is

1271
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,839
a useful thing do you think that they

1272
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,319
provide meaningful reasonable results

1273
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:47,760
and

1274
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,599
are these results

1275
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,119
satisfactory

1276
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,839
characterize the performances of the

1277
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,920
device under test or is there anything

1278
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,960
missing

1279
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,359
and i have a first question

1280
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,559
uh

1281
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,040
what do you think about measuring the

1282
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,040
connection tiered our performance

1283
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,200
unfortunately uh i can offer only a way

1284
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,520
that i fill

1285
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,599
and number of connections in the

1286
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,000
connection tracking table and then i did

1287
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,680
this whole the entire connection

1288
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,839
tracking table it can be done with ip

1289
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,119
tables by

1290
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,680
deleting the ip tables rule and then

1291
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,920
removing the kernel module or it can

1292
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,280
also be done with you which is a nat64

1293
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,800
implementation by by restarting joule

1294
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,520
and we can measure its time so i have

1295
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,000
experienced that it lasted longer than

1296
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,319
filling in the state table

1297
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,520
sometimes it lasted for minutes when i

1298
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,359
when i used

1299
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:47,520
high number of connections

1300
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,200
so it's enough to to just

1301
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,040
measure the the

1302
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,680
aggregate time of n number of

1303
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,960
connections

1304
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,680
deleting them i don't know

1305
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,280
so thank you very much for listening and

1306
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,359
i'm very curious of your opinion your

1307
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,200
suggestions

1308
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,598
anything

1309
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:10,640
okay thanks gabor um

1310
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,119
i'd like to open it up for uh questions

1311
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,119
and and comments at this point i think

1312
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,119
you've got you've you've brought us up

1313
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,200
to date and uh you've got reasonable

1314
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,920
requests for feedback here so uh

1315
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,240
let's hear some feedback on on this

1316
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,240
uh on your work that is pretty

1317
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,920
fundamental to

1318
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,599
the kind of thing we normally do in

1319
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:30,720
benchmarking

1320
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,759
methodology working group

1321
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,480
okay i don't see any requests for the

1322
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,559
floor

1323
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,839
so um

1324
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,119
gabor maybe you know maybe there would

1325
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,319
be more

1326
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:09,520
is are there any backup slides here

1327
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,200
where you show the results or something

1328
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,599
like that

1329
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,480
well uh

1330
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,800
if you think about the measurement

1331
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,319
results

1332
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:23,920
of the ipt bus testing i have some

1333
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,400
slides uh i invented them for uh the

1334
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,280
ip version 6

1335
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,800
how did i say

1336
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,799
so the other other meeting but i have

1337
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:40,720
some slides here i just try to find them

1338
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,240
so benchmarking states for slides

1339
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,319
yeah it's here

1340
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,559
i hope they are

1341
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,839
no it's not that sorry

1342
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:53,599
sorry

1343
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:57,200
ip version 6 solution scalability slides

1344
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,319
yes

1345
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,079
i think

1346
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,640
they are

1347
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,760
no

1348
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,240
i'm sorry i just can't find my slides

1349
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,440
but anyway i will be able to do that uh

1350
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,920
so i i have uploaded uh my i don't know

1351
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,960
i

1352
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,640
okay i will find

1353
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,359
i started to fred baker

1354
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,880
the other slides and i will find it here

1355
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,760
yeah

1356
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,720
all right and yes i'm kind of assuming

1357
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,640
that you'll be able to

1358
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,400
that i'll be able to allow you to share

1359
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,400
your screen at some

1360
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,040
juncture here

1361
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,880
but otherwise i can try to find the

1362
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,119
i can try to find something that you

1363
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,599
sent to them to the mailing list where

1364
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,520
which will allow me to share

1365
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,040
like kind of like the text version of

1366
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,079
this

1367
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,240
uh i have i have got now the the file

1368
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,000
uh

1369
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,720
if i just

1370
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,839
i just save it

1371
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,839
to myself and

1372
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:08,720
i find find the slides

1373
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,440
i save it here

1374
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,839
and yeah it's in work

1375
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:14,960
save

1376
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,880
okay open the slides and

1377
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,599
yes i need to open i need to be able to

1378
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,760
to

1379
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,559
no

1380
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,160
i'm sorry

1381
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,559
oh i i see the wrong

1382
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,240
file yes

1383
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,319
wait a minute

1384
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:41,319
yeah

1385
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,319
yes i've got i got the slice now

1386
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:49,760
uh

1387
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,160
i think i would like to ask permission

1388
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,240
from you to share the screen

1389
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,920
yeah

1390
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,359
okay so

1391
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,440
yes grant screen

1392
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,359
i've given it

1393
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:04,559
yes i didn't want to share my screen

1394
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:07,280
select window or screen

1395
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,240
i would like to share

1396
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,799
transition scalability slides

1397
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,000
pdf

1398
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,200
hello

1399
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,640
can you see my

1400
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,240
screen yes

1401
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,000
yes we can still

1402
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,240
still see can you see i got it to full

1403
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,359
screen

1404
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:26,720
yes yes it's great thanks so these are

1405
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,439
the results

1406
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,160
i just start with the other one so you

1407
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:32,960
see

1408
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,440
here the number of course 1 2 4 8

1409
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,440
and 16 chords

1410
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,119
and i measure the

1411
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,520
number of connection per seconds median

1412
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:47,680
minimum maximum it is in thousands so it

1413
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,559
means that

1414
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:51,680
223 thousand

1415
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,400
and here is

1416
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,400
2.3 million

1417
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,280
so

1418
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,720
and these are the number of cores that

1419
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,440
are allocated to the uh

1420
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,920
to a virtual machine that's that's doing

1421
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,720
the nat function

1422
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,640
40

1423
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,559
i i'm asking i'm asking

1424
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,119
in in the case of number of cores

1425
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,680
uh you are you're allocating a certain

1426
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,119
number of cores to the nat processes

1427
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,559
yes uh it means that i use the uh

1428
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:25,839
physical machine and uh i just ditched

1429
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,920
one of the cores

1430
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,760
so with the

1431
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,359
kernel parameter i could switch on and

1432
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:33,359
off the cores

1433
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,839
right so first i measure the single core

1434
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:38,240
and then with two cores four cores eight

1435
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,960
core and 16 cores

1436
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,799
right probably something like task set

1437
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:45,280
with for a list of pro list of cores or

1438
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,480
something like that with a with a

1439
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,839
particular process

1440
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:52,000
okay and you can see that it scaled up

1441
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,359
quite well so it uh from one quarter to

1442
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,319
core

1443
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:58,640
do you also see my my little pointing

1444
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,680
hand

1445
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,880
yes yes we do so when going to two chord

1446
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,359
it doesn't double and from for two

1447
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:08,240
chords to to focus on double but it's

1448
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,880
significant significantly increased and

1449
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,359
i also calculated the relative scale up

1450
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:15,520
so

1451
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,160
it's not the double and at the end it's

1452
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,359
not not 16 16 times more but you you can

1453
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:22,720
see it

1454
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,240
about 10 times more so it's quite good

1455
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,359
scaling

1456
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,599
and here's the throughput

1457
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:33,440
and also it's in double but

1458
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,559
similarly it's about the performance of

1459
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:39,760
of 10 cores so you know 16 cores

1460
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,920
i could achieve the performance of

1461
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,040
uh 10 cores so it's not bad i think

1462
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,079
right

1463
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:46,880
so

1464
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,040
just a question this was this testing

1465
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,520
was this testing on on a

1466
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,680
uh an intel architecture where you've

1467
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,839
got uh two pneuma nodes something like

1468
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:57,119
that

1469
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,480
yes it was intel i can show you the the

1470
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,200
previous slide this here it is a dell

1471
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,359
poweredge

1472
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:06,400
r430 server

1473
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:11,119
and uh the uh clock was set to fixed 2.1

1474
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,960
gigahertz this is the ram size and there

1475
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,200
were two uh 10 giga do a port

1476
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,000
nics

1477
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,520
it is the

1478
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,119
internal

1479
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,960
so the the dell bios actually has

1480
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,359
virtualization uh features were those

1481
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:30,559
turned on to help out the cpus here

1482
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,200
uh high pass running was switched off

1483
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,520
okay and it didn't do any virtualization

1484
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,559
it was a physical machine

1485
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,760
this computer

1486
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,960
had 32 cores but i didn't didn't use

1487
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,119
didn't uh include the measurement

1488
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,440
research of course because there's some

1489
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,799
some kind of problem uh because uh if i

1490
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:55,440
use 32 cores no interrupts were

1491
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,480
scheduled for the last uh 16 cores so i

1492
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,559
excluded those scores i didn't include

1493
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,880
it didn't it didn't really increase

1494
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,319
after 16 chords because of that problem

1495
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:08,839
sorry what did you want to

1496
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:12,079
say you know uh hey first thank you for

1497
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:14,000
presenting results i think

1498
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,839
uh if we were in person you'd have a

1499
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,119
line of people sitting in the front

1500
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:18,880
chairs leaning over to to see your

1501
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,040
results it's always fun when we get

1502
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,559
these results in the working group so

1503
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,559
thank you for sharing them

1504
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:27,920
i am a little surprised to see 16 course

1505
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,880
um

1506
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,200
kind of performs at the speed of 10 in

1507
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,359
your statement that hey this is not bad

1508
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:35,520
scaling i realize it's probably not in

1509
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,119
the purview of the draft i was just

1510
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:38,720
curious as to why you thought that was

1511
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,359
okay scaling

1512
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:42,400
but

1513
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,520
it was it was important for me at the uh

1514
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,000
ip version 6 operations group how it

1515
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,160
scales because there are some opinions

1516
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,240
that states for technologies don't scale

1517
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,960
there and stateless scale well and i

1518
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,960
think it's a quite a good skill to kill

1519
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,920
up so i did some some uh

1520
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,440
alternative dns server benchmarking and

1521
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,680
even that was not better

1522
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,920
but here it is a stateful thing you know

1523
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,480
we have to handle the connection timing

1524
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,079
table and

1525
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:15,200
how well these cpus can cooperate on the

1526
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,880
same connection tracking table i think

1527
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,520
it's a really good result

1528
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,440
if if you have some time i can show you

1529
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,440
some other results these are the

1530
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,079
scalability agents the number of

1531
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:28,880
current sessions concurrent sessions so

1532
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,799
how many sessions are stored in the

1533
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:33,440
state table

1534
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:34,880
you see

1535
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,160
here is the number of connections a

1536
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,839
million

1537
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:41,119
and i could test up to 800 million

1538
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:42,480
but it was really the limits of the

1539
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,839
hardware

1540
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:46,960
when i used only 400 million connections

1541
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,839
it was somewhat less than

1542
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:50,400
150

1543
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,000
gigabytes

1544
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,039
the usage of memory and it was somewhat

1545
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:57,599
below 300 gigabytes but

1546
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:59,960
all together we have only

1547
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,960
384 gigabytes so in this case in the

1548
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,160
last column you see the results when uh

1549
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,880
non-numerical memory was also used and

1550
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,559
there was another

1551
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:15,200
other limit that i couldn't set the

1552
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,720
hash hash table size higher than this

1553
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,160
one

1554
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,200
so this is the highest one you see that

1555
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,240
we always uh

1556
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,039
quadrupled

1557
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,079
the numbers because uh of increasing the

1558
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:33,440
port numbers

1559
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,160
and i couldn't do it anymore because it

1560
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,760
gave me an error message

1561
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,960
so

1562
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,039
you know what it works that iptables has

1563
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,000
a hash table and from every uh entry of

1564
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,960
the hash table the link list is is

1565
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,720
started and

1566
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,039
usually the link list has less than one

1567
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,760
element but here it's on average all

1568
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,599
linked list has three elements so it it

1569
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,000
was a factor which it slows down the

1570
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,039
operation and of course you can see some

1571
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:02,799
degradation some performance regulation

1572
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:03,680
here

1573
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,599
but here you can see that this loop is

1574
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,520
near constant here

1575
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:12,079
4.4 milli 4.5 4.5 and so and so on it's

1576
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:14,000
just measurement error is 4.4 i think

1577
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,599
this is the constant 4.5 and here at the

1578
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,240
beginning i think the the first column

1579
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,200
is higher because of the level 3 cache

1580
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,480
it still

1581
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,839
could do something

1582
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:29,920
but it means that

1583
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,559
in a wide range it's quite scalable of

1584
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:34,799
course the price was that i increased

1585
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:37,200
the hash table size and it used a lot of

1586
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,400
memory

1587
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,680
but it was quite good

1588
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,119
yeah very interesting thank you for

1589
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:44,880
sharing this

1590
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,960
thank you

1591
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,559
yeah it's always interested to

1592
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,000
interesting to look at some actual

1593
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,400
results and and then we can

1594
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,319
you know get a feeling for the value of

1595
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:55,200
uh

1596
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,319
the benchmarks you've proposed so uh

1597
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,480
that's a that's a great follow-up uh

1598
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,640
gabor and i'm glad we took an extra

1599
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,319
moment or two to get this

1600
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,000
uh on the screen and make it part of our

1601
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,880
meeting

1602
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,920
thanks thank you

1603
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,200
all right

1604
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:15,118
so going back to um

1605
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,839
uh going back to the questions you

1606
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:19,039
raised

1607
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:21,119
uh i'm gonna

1608
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,839
see if i can hijack the screen here

1609
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:26,480
i stop sharing so you will get back this

1610
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,839
the screen

1611
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:30,319
very good

1612
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,359
all right

1613
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:43,598
and

1614
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,319
so i think i think we can

1615
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,200
kind of answer this first question now

1616
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,760
uh do they provide meaningful and and uh

1617
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,599
reasonable results um in the in the use

1618
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:59,680
case where you've applied them to ask to

1619
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,680
try to answer a question about you know

1620
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,839
the difference between stateless and and

1621
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:08,079
stateful uh i think the answer is uh yes

1622
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:09,599
and um

1623
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,520
uh you've got a couple of good metrics

1624
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,599
there i think that uh

1625
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,920
there's some ability to think about this

1626
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,839
more um

1627
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,400
yeah i i think in my comments i was

1628
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,160
wondering about the size whether the

1629
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,440
size of the um

1630
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,799
whether the size of the table uh itself

1631
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,799
was a was a metric that was worth

1632
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:37,440
measuring did this is the table capacity

1633
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,799
is that one of the ones that you've

1634
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:41,359
proposed

1635
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,079
yes it's a good question

1636
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:46,079
as i could set the size of the

1637
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,720
connection taking table in case of ip

1638
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,039
tables so it was not interesting for me

1639
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:52,400
to measure it

1640
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,920
but

1641
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,240
i have a little experience uh with juul

1642
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,280
my student works with that and we

1643
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,359
couldn't find any way to set its

1644
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,839
connection tracking table size so it may

1645
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:07,760
be an interesting metric

1646
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,440
and yes

1647
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,160
we can measure it but it's not very easy

1648
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,280
you you saw that uh as i knew that it as

1649
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,280
i knew that it's the size was large

1650
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,319
enough i could be sure that if

1651
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:23,200
i try to add uh

1652
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,720
new entries and the problem can only be

1653
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,359
that i do it too fast and this is why

1654
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:31,760
how i could this is how i could measure

1655
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,079
uh the maximum connection establishment

1656
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:36,799
rate however if i don't know its size

1657
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:38,880
and i don't know its maximum conduction

1658
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,839
establishment rate yet

1659
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:42,799
then there are

1660
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:45,599
two good reasons to fail a test because

1661
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:47,839
i do it too fast or because the the

1662
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,319
table is exhausted so i have to be

1663
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:53,440
tricky to measure both or

1664
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,000
just one and then the other but it i

1665
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,200
think

1666
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,319
it's reasonable and it can be done

1667
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:02,720
yeah at least at least you can you can

1668
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,799
report the number of uh connections that

1669
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:07,280
you've used uh during a test

1670
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,160
and uh and in the follow-up testing uh

1671
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,280
so that's

1672
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,839
uh at least you can infer something

1673
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:16,000
about the capacity there from uh from

1674
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,040
that

1675
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,960
okay

1676
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,479
and um

1677
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:24,000
oh yeah connection teardown performance

1678
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,520
so

1679
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,000
so then you're working with uh timeouts

1680
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,319
again and and

1681
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,479
the efficiency of connection uh tear

1682
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:34,799
down in the in the device

1683
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:37,040
um

1684
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,040
it i think it's reasonable to look into

1685
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,238
that um but i can certainly imagine some

1686
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:46,080
some difficulties uh trying to make a uh

1687
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,759
trying to make a repeatable benchmark

1688
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:48,880
out of it what do you what do you think

1689
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,640
gabor

1690
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,600
yeah the trouble is that uh i'm not sure

1691
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,960
if if how many of them times out and how

1692
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,560
many new i should should uh include so

1693
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,679
it's

1694
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,319
what i can do easily is that

1695
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:07,279
i drew a first phase and i

1696
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:09,120
just input a lot of

1697
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,439
entries and then i

1698
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:14,158
just finished the measurement and i call

1699
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:15,759
something which which destroys the

1700
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:18,560
connection table in case of ip tables i

1701
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,198
can just delete the ip tables rule and i

1702
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:24,238
can remove with rm mode linux command

1703
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:27,120
the the canon module and then it lasts

1704
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,799
for a long time for minutes to to do to

1705
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,799
execute the command and i can measure

1706
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,640
its time and of course i can do the

1707
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,839
measurements with different number of uh

1708
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:39,920
connections and

1709
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,880
i can estimate uh how much

1710
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,000
work

1711
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,279
on average to destroy one connection i'm

1712
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,198
not sure how how much

1713
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:51,920
if it is good or not

1714
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,679
i see i see

1715
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:57,679
and and and that uh that manual uh

1716
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:00,239
uh deletion of the entire uh

1717
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:03,679
table is uh uh

1718
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:06,159
it should be a process maybe similar to

1719
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:08,000
the time out process

1720
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,239
um but it's kind of surprising i get

1721
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,239
maybe not so surprising when when you've

1722
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:14,880
got you know connections in in the sizes

1723
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,280
that you're talking about here and

1724
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,120
really large numbers

1725
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,440
so um

1726
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,000
in any case that's a uh

1727
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,560
it's just something to think about i i i

1728
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,000
can see that you're already thinking

1729
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,040
about it and um uh

1730
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,800
you know if you uh

1731
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,719
uh if you try some things and and

1732
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:36,640
there's something useful comes out of it

1733
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,159
i think that's worth i think that's

1734
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,080
worth investigating because it is you

1735
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,760
know it's the it's the other side of

1736
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,679
connection establishment and and that

1737
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:44,560
feels

1738
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,679
uh feels good feels symmetrical to uh to

1739
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:50,480
understand both

1740
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,239
yes and of course

1741
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:54,960
because i didn't make a sure

1742
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,280
measurements but it seemed to me that it

1743
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,600
was even slower than establishing the

1744
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,520
connections so it's

1745
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,440
it's even significant so if if you uh if

1746
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:09,120
you're an eisp and you operate a gateway

1747
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,040
then new connections are coming and some

1748
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,480
connections are deleted

1749
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,080
and it matters uh how much effort it it

1750
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,600
it takes to date a connection

1751
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,560
right

1752
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:26,040
right it you know it seems like um

1753
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:28,719
it seems like if you filled

1754
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:30,640
well yeah if you knew the capacity of

1755
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,320
the you have to know the capacity of the

1756
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,600
table and then you fill it and then you

1757
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,640
you

1758
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,679
wait a certain amount of time where

1759
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:41,600
a number of the connections

1760
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,960
should be

1761
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,320
a

1762
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,840
number of the first connections

1763
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,480
established should be cleared

1764
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,679
and then

1765
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:52,080
you you know it should have timed out

1766
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,760
and then you try to establish a whole

1767
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,159
new block of of connections

1768
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,800
and uh determine whether the device is

1769
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,760
ready

1770
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,520
uh for those yet or um

1771
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,920
things along those lines it seems to me

1772
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,800
that we've had we've had some testing

1773
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,760
uh like this proposed you know of this

1774
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,520
ilk uh proposed in the past and um

1775
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,080
i'm i'm not i'm not connecting it to a

1776
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,360
particular

1777
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,320
uh rfc that we did but i'm sure that

1778
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,159
there's one out there where we or we had

1779
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:27,679
to grapple with this so um anyway that's

1780
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:30,719
something to think about too

1781
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,840
and uh yeah so far i think the aggregate

1782
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,400
measurements are are a great start here

1783
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,120
and uh as you say can't do anything else

1784
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,440
but the depletion time is a

1785
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,760
that might be a um an interesting thing

1786
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,960
to investigate further

1787
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,360
okay

1788
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,120
well um

1789
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,280
thank you gabor for your for your talk i

1790
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,679
i just wanted to quickly summarize uh

1791
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,199
that uh in the may july period

1792
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:01,440
uh i saw five people discussing the

1793
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,040
draft on the list

1794
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,120
uh there was uh you know the references

1795
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,800
to the procedures in

1796
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,880
rfc 8219

1797
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:11,679
uh which our friend uh

1798
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,840
marius worked on i believe right

1799
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,960
and and also um uh

1800
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,719
there was sort of some interest in the

1801
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:21,199
tcp based uh testing

1802
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:22,560
um

1803
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,920
and um

1804
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:24,960
uh

1805
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,040
that was uh you know something that that

1806
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,040
was talked about but right now you're

1807
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,840
all udp and i think that's that's

1808
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:37,120
probably a good scope for uh for now

1809
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,840
the

1810
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,040
i guess the question to the group is uh

1811
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,880
with the with the

1812
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,800
this traffic that we've seen and the

1813
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,040
reasonable results that we've that we've

1814
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:52,000
seen and uh and actually the open source

1815
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,040
implementation of some of this that uh

1816
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,159
gabor has prepared and made available to

1817
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:00,719
us on on several occasions

1818
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:02,159
um

1819
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:04,000
what if people think about

1820
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,800
possibly adopting this draft as a as a

1821
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,360
working group item

1822
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:21,789
[Music]

1823
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,239
and i'm looking for feedback from the

1824
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:26,320
group who's read the draft anybody read

1825
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,199
the draft

1826
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:31,919
besides me

1827
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,920
all right

1828
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,159
well among the folks that read it

1829
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:39,440
there was pretty good support

1830
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,120
unfortunately we don't have them here on

1831
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,719
the list here today

1832
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:43,440
so

1833
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,839
um

1834
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,880
well

1835
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,760
hey al

1836
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,679
yeah sorry go ahead

1837
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:58,800
i i think it's uh gabor i apologize i

1838
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,480
hadn't had a chance to go through this

1839
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:03,199
in detail but i will take a look and

1840
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:05,520
uh frankly between what have piqued my

1841
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,440
interest to put it on the reading list

1842
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,199
and i'm running out of time and this

1843
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:12,080
presentation today i do think it's worth

1844
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,560
asking the the working group for the

1845
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,120
support and i would um

1846
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,400
also

1847
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,080
i mean i always read the drafts but i

1848
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,440
just wanted to weigh in officially and

1849
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,280
say thank you for doing this thanks for

1850
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,199
presenting the results uh and i will

1851
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:27,120
absolutely read it formally and share my

1852
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:30,239
feedback with you on the list

1853
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,120
good all right well i think what we'll

1854
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,880
try to do is is

1855
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:40,239
any is not now ask any any volunteers to

1856
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:45,320
read the draft in the next month or so

1857
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,920
okay

1858
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,679
well then we'll try to we'll try to ask

1859
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,600
that same question on the mailing list

1860
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,600
uh gabor i think you're i mean i think

1861
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,280
you're basically doing a good job of

1862
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,120
that and um

1863
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,760
uh if you um

1864
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,199
you know if you if you have some more

1865
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:11,360
results to share with us that may help

1866
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:14,400
get some um

1867
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,239
commentary going and i would share i

1868
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:20,239
would share these these questions on the

1869
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:22,400
mailing list as well as a kind of a

1870
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,800
prompt for folks to read uh read the

1871
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:25,920
draft

1872
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,320
and uh and then maybe we can you know

1873
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,480
depending upon what happens in the

1874
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,520
remainder of november and december uh we

1875
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,360
can maybe take up a working group

1876
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:38,080
adoption call in uh january or sometime

1877
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,840
in 2022.

1878
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:44,880
uh is that a uh is that a good solution

1879
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,159
thank you very much for that i'm very

1880
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:49,280
happy happy for your willingness to do

1881
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,519
that

1882
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,440
so

1883
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,040
reviewers

1884
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,400
in

1885
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,879
november

1886
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,840
and

1887
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,719
december and then

1888
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,880
possible

1889
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,600
in 20.2

1890
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,520
yeah that's good because you know this

1891
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,199
is the kind of thing that's right up our

1892
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:20,960
alley it's it's very

1893
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,840
um you know obviously very benchmarking

1894
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,840
centric and and uh

1895
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,400
your your your work here to advance our

1896
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,000
state of the art is very much

1897
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,640
appreciated so thanks

1898
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,960
okay

1899
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,080
very welcome all right um

1900
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:38,880
so

1901
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,239
the last uh topic today is a uh

1902
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:43,199
is a

1903
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:45,040
brand new topic

1904
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,440
um it was proposed

1905
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,719
by uh

1906
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:52,480
zeki lai and his co-authors

1907
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:53,600
and

1908
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:58,159
i'm gonna share some slides here

1909
01:17:58,159 --> 01:17:59,280
which were

1910
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,320
which were prepared for this talk

1911
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,040
and you can all read the the title of

1912
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,719
the talk here with me together problems

1913
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:08,000
and requirements

1914
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,120
of evaluation methodology for integrated

1915
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,520
space and terrestrial networks

1916
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,199
so we're going to learn a lot about this

1917
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:17,199
today and um

1918
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:20,480
you know i i i really thank zeki and his

1919
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,600
co-authors for uh uh bringing this to us

1920
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,400
to our attention

1921
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:29,840
but i will say one thing uh in advance

1922
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,080
and that is that

1923
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,840
our work

1924
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,280
on benchmarking

1925
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,840
is uh limited to what we can do in the

1926
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,800
uh the isolated test environment

1927
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,560
and um

1928
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:43,280
that

1929
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,360
that means that um you know we're

1930
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,800
obviously not going to be running any

1931
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,800
benchmarks uh over satellites

1932
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,640
at least things that we kind of the

1933
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,120
things that we kind of create here but

1934
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,760
um and i'll say more about this at the

1935
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,159
end i i'd just like to think i'd like

1936
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:03,760
folks to think about um as as uh zeki

1937
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,159
eli describes this work

1938
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:10,000
um what what kinds of pieces of it uh we

1939
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,840
might be able to tackle

1940
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,840
uh in the near term

1941
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,360
uh within

1942
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,920
within our charter if anything

1943
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,600
and and um and if more development or or

1944
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,120
research or other activity is needed um

1945
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,360
then then let's try to figure out what

1946
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,440
those things are and and give that

1947
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:30,960
feedback today

1948
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,080
um

1949
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,400
but with that uh

1950
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,520
zeki and his uh co-authors are are all

1951
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,440
uh new to the working group as far as i

1952
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:43,600
know so uh welcome uh and uh you can uh

1953

so uh hello everyone in the bmw fox good

1961
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,840
morning and good afternoon

1962
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,960
and maybe good night for myself because

1963
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,400
this is about 1am in my place so this is

1964
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,520
30 life from the institute for network

1965
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,280
science and cyberspace ching hai

1966
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,639
university and this is my first time to

1967
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:22,719
participate the online meeting of the

1968
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:25,360
our benchmarking working group

1969
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,280
so today i'm going to introduce our

1970
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,600
draft talking about the problems and

1971
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,159
requirements of evaluation mastery for

1972
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:35,040
integrated space and terrestrial network

1973
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,080
so next please please

1974
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:41,520
okay so first let's get started with the

1975
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,080
background and motivation so recently we

1976
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,320
have witnessed a renaissance in the

1977
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:49,520
space industry and it stimulates an

1978
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,159
explosion of growth in constructing new

1979
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:54,159
space mega constellations

1980
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:56,400
a number of companies have disclosed

1981
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,960
efforts along these slides including

1982
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,400
spacex amazon one web and so on

1983
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,239
so these mega constellations are

1984
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:06,800
proposed to provide global internet

1985
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,719
service for example

1986
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:10,800
elon musk sent the first tweet through

1987
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,000
the space where starting satellites and

1988
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,120
recently google said that it signed a

1989
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,199
deal with spacex to use the space

1990
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:20,880
company's growing satellite internet

1991
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,480
service starting with its cloud unit

1992
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,040
spacex will also install starlinks

1993
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,280
terminals at google's cloud data centers

1994
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:32,000
around the world aiming to utilize the

1995
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,320
cloud for starting customers and

1996
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,560
enabling google to use this satellite

1997
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:39,360
network's bd internet for its enterprise

1998
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,679
cloud consumers

1999
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:44,800
as of november 2021 there are already

2000
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,480
four thousand and five hundred active

2001
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,560
satellites launched in the orbits

2002
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,760
according to the ucs database

2003
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,920
so look at this two table two two

2004
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,199
figures as the usa has about two

2005
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:58,880
thousand and

2006
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,960
seven hundred active satellites and

2007
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,520
china have about 400 satellites and the

2008
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,960
united kingdom has about

2009
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:09,199
340 satellites and we can found that

2010
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:11,920
most of these satellites are for from

2011
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,920
mega constellations for the internet

2012
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,239
service for example this figure the

2013
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:19,280
right the light stung figure styling has

2014
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,520
launched its first share of phase one

2015
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,400
which consists of 1006

2016
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,400
satellites in low earth orbit which will

2017
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,320
mean leo

2018
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,280
next slide please

2019
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,440
so with such plans in progress for

2020
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,520
large-scale satellite

2021
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,000
to provide a global internet service

2022
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,320
the internet is potentially taking one

2023
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,239
year's leap into space

2024
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:46,159
what might the internet be in the next

2025
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:50,080
decade the future is up in the sky here

2026
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:52,400
our understanding for internet for the

2027
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,480
internet in the next decade which we

2028
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,480
call that integrated space and

2029
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:59,280
terrestrial networks or istn

2030
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,840
as a high level the istm will contain

2031
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,400
two segments the first one is the space

2032
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,639
segment including satellites and ground

2033
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:09,600
stations here the leo stands for low

2034
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,639
earth orbits which means less than 2000

2035
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:14,800
kilometers orbital attitude

2036
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,560
emerging mega constellations like

2037
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,199
starlink one wipe and the amazon cooper

2038
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,280
work in leo

2039
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,199
the second segment is the terrestrial

2040
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:25,520
segments which include the network

2041
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,600
infrastructures of today's terrestrial

2042
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:28,960
internet

2043
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:31,920
taken together istn can provide internet

2044
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,920
service for various users such as

2045
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,920
space-based users and traditional

2046
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,679
interesting users

2047
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,800
so next page please

2048
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,280
the integration of satellite is

2049
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,360
constellations and terrestrial network

2050
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:50,320
opens a lot of great new opportunities

2051
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,639
the first one is that istn can

2052
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:54,960
potentially provide pervasive network

2053
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,600
accessibility for various users

2054
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,920
according to a recent broad report from

2055
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,480
statistics the global internet

2056
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,199
penetration rate is about only about 60

2057
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:06,639
percentage

2058
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:08,239
there are still a large portion of

2059
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:10,880
population still have no internet access

2060
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,000
in the world

2061
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,480
istn is promising to provide internet

2062
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:17,040
success for remote or rural users and

2063
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:20,239
many other situations like maritime

2064
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:23,120
global iot airplane users

2065
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:26,239
in addition istn can also be used for

2066
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:29,280
many new scenarios such as space flights

2067
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,080
deep space navigation and exploration

2068
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,120
so next page please

2069
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:39,280
the second istn can provide low latency

2070
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,760
for wide area long-haul communications

2071
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,920
the low latency opportunity is based on

2072
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,520
two important facts

2073
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,440
first emerging satellites can be

2074
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,760
equipped with inter-satellite links for

2075
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,159
example the free space laser links for

2076
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:54,000
intercellular communication

2077
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,239
laser links can communicate at the speed

2078
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:58,880
of the light in a vacuum which is much

2079
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,480
faster than that in the terrestrial

2080
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:01,679
fiber

2081
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:02,639
second

2082
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,880
evently evenly distributed leo

2083
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,440
satellites can establish near to optimal

2084
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:10,480
space roads and enable lower latency as

2085
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,239
compared with meandering terrestrial

2086
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:13,600
fiber roles

2087
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,000
for example this right picture shows an

2088
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,719
example on one hand assume two

2089
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:21,199
communication ends locate at beijing and

2090
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,120
sydney for

2091
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,760
for for some isps if you use the trace

2092
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,080
route to track the package forwarding we

2093
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,880
can find that the package might be first

2094
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,199
be forwarded to los angeles and then to

2095
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:34,239
sydney

2096
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:36,719
on the other hand if we can use leo

2097
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:39,280
satellites to with intercept links to

2098
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,040
create space roads

2099
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,360
like the green line in this figure we

2100
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,600
can obtain the near to optimal path with

2101
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,600
reduced latency

2102
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,120
the next page

2103
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:52,000
next page please

2104
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:55,199
and the third opportunity is that istn

2105
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:57,360
can be can enable high through

2106
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,960
throughput assess

2107
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,880
free space high-speed inter-satellite

2108
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,600
links can provide several gbps data

2109
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,639
rates and the new ka or ku radio

2110
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:08,800
frequency links can also provide very

2111
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,199
high speed ground station links so this

2112
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:13,600
picture shows a speed test from the

2113
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,920
individual styling beta test

2114
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,719
so one individual can user can obtain

2115
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:21,679
about 400 mbps downlink data rate over

2116
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:23,440
the current version of starting

2117
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:26,159
constellation

2118
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:28,719
next page

2119
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:30,960
but

2120
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,840
while promising istn also involves

2121
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,159
several unique characteristics that

2122
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:37,440
might be the

2123
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,440
roadblocks of realizing such new

2124
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,639
opportunities

2125
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:42,960
the first characteristic characteristic

2126
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,520
is the high dynamics on a global scale

2127
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:48,159
these two figures use the first share of

2128
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:50,239
sterling constellation with more than

2129
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:52,560
one thousand and five hundred of stars

2130
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,960
find hundreds of stress satellites

2131
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,280
this satellite moves in very high

2132
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,880
optical velocity and it takes about

2133
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,960
19 minutes to make what make a one path

2134
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,679
around the earth that means the space

2135
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,840
ground connectivity could change in

2136
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,800
every about every three minutes

2137
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,159
such dynamics may cause many connect for

2138
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:16,880
example connectivity loss routing

2139
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,560
reconvergence and other issues

2140
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,199
next stage

2141
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:27,199
the second characteristic is that mega

2142
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:29,280
constellations are still under heavy

2143
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,639
development

2144
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:32,800
there is this manning unknown

2145
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,040
or unexplored uncertainty in the

2146
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,760
architecture mechanisms and protocols in

2147
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,440
future istm

2148
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,880
just like this draft we pr we propose

2149
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,440
maybe the first pro maybe the first for

2150
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:48,159
the version is awful so we need many

2151
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:50,880
rounds to discuss and modify our draft

2152
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,159
to polish it

2153
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:54,239
and the styling constellation today is

2154
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:56,639
not the same as its first version and we

2155
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:58,800
believe it is it is not the final

2156
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:02,159
version and it will still evolve rapidly

2157
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:04,719
in the future

2158
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:07,520
the next page

2159
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,080
finally as compared with many other

2160
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,239
kinds of terrestrial networks the

2161
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:14,400
operational cost of a satellite network

2162
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,280
could be very high here i mean here at

2163
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,600
the cost i mean the time and money for

2164
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,159
example uh it may take years from a

2165
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:24,800
trunk check to the rear satellite launch

2166
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,400
and if we have deployed the satellite in

2167
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,679
outer space

2168
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,600
updating a deployed constellation is

2169
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,600
costly

2170
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,400
so next page

2171
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:40,719
so here when we look back at the history

2172
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:43,360
of internet we found we can found that

2173
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,840
evolution evolution and benchmark play

2174
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,920
an important role in the evolution of

2175
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,520
our internet

2176
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,400
if we look ahead since istn is still

2177
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,719
revolving very rapidly and not in the

2178
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:58,239
final stage we argue that rs istn

2179
01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:01,600
necessitates the right evolution storage

2180
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,239
there should be many new designs and

2181
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:06,800
internet working technologies in ica

2182
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,199
such as new constellation new

2183
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:12,080
architecture new topology new routing

2184
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,480
mechanisms and new transports and new

2185
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,639
applications

2186
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:19,199
next page

2187
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:22,719
because there are many uncertainties and

2188
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:25,199
operational cost of satellite network is

2189
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:28,719
high so such new network designs are

2190
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:31,280
expected to be comprehensively and

2191
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:34,159
systematically evaluated before they are

2192
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:37,679
deployed and launched to outer space

2193
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:40,400
next page

2194
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:42,480
and here when we talk about the

2195
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,239
evaluation storage

2196
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:47,040
first we need to create an experimental

2197
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,360
network environment or a laboratory

2198
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:50,719
environment

2199
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,560
second we need a series of

2200
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,800
recommendations of benchmark or test

2201
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,880
case to be run in the laboratory

2202
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,679
environment and again implementation

2203
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:02,320
implications for tested internet working

2204
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,320
technologies

2205
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,559
next page

2206
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,440
thus we ask the question how can we

2207
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,920
evaluate such new internet working

2208
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:17,679
designs for future istn

2209
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,800
so next page please

2210
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,960
so next let's do look at the possible

2211
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,360
evaluation storage the first one and the

2212
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:28,000
most straightforward approach is to

2213
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,239
leverage leave satellite networks to

2214
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:31,920
evaluate new sites

2215
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,239
for example starling has started its

2216
01:30:34,239 --> 01:30:37,360
beta test recently however this however

2217
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,040
this approach suffers from several

2218
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,400
limitations

2219
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,480
first the leave satellite network lacks

2220
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,040
the flexibility to explore various

2221
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,679
experimental requirements for example it

2222
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:49,280
is very difficult to change the

2223
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,560
constellation

2224
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,400
exchanged maybe change the inter

2225
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,320
satellite or ground satellite

2226
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,719
connectivity to evaluate various

2227
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:59,920
internet working technologies of istm

2228
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,000
second the accessibility of a live

2229
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,159
satellite leaves satellite network could

2230
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:06,080
be constrained in many regions around

2231
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,560
the world as far as i know for example

2232
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,800
studying their tests is only available

2233
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:13,120
in certain regions around the world

2234
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:16,080
finally directly conducting experiments

2235
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,080
in the leave network has many

2236
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,800
constraints for example it is difficult

2237
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:24,000
to conduct top large topology or login

2238
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,600
test in a live satellite network

2239
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,159
next page please

2240
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:35,360
the second approach is using simulations

2241
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:37,679
to evaluate or benchmark new designs for

2242
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:38,960
ists

2243
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:41,600
both aerospace and network community

2244
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,719
have many simulation tools to create an

2245
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:46,639
experimental network environment for

2246
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:47,760
evaluation

2247
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,719
for example stk is a rapid

2248
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:52,880
representative of orbital anesthetic

2249
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,040
tool that can perform complex analysis

2250
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:58,239
of spacecraft as well as ground stations

2251
01:31:58,239 --> 01:32:01,440
however sdk may mainly focus on orbit

2252
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,520
and spacecraft analysis and have the

2253
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,320
limited support for simulation of

2254
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,480
internet working technologies

2255
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:12,320
most recently more recently sms s3 hyper

2256
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,000
tier and star probe are emerging

2257
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,080
simulators for istn the is3 is an

2258
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,560
extension to the s3

2259
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:23,520
simulation platform and it models a full

2260
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,520
satellite network with a geostationary

2261
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,560
set like and bandpass payload

2262
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,880
hypertri is a framework for simulating

2263
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,960
and visualizing the network behaviors of

2264
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,960
emerging mega constellations

2265
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:37,199
similarly star perf is a simulator

2266
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:39,199
simulator that enables users to

2267
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:42,000
characterize estimate and understand

2268
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,840
achievable network performance under

2269
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,800
variety of constellation options

2270
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,880
although the above simulators can

2271
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,960
flexibly simulate satellite

2272
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,120
characteristics and the impact of

2273
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,520
dynamics of network conditions a

2274
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,120
fundamental limitation of those

2275
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:00,000
simulators is that they cannot support

2276
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,760
run of real system codes or

2277
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:05,040
functionalities as in real deployment

2278
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,520
the abstraction level of pure simulators

2279
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,840
might be too high to capture the system

2280
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,400
level effects and could and could hide

2281
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:13,280
other

2282
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:15,520
practical issues for example software or

2283
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,000
hand under the heavy workload in real

2284
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,840
resistance

2285
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:23,159
next page

2286
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,560
so the third approach is emulation

2287
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,960
emulation is a hybrid approach that

2288
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:33,760
integrates real applications protocols

2289
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,400
and operating systems in the network

2290
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:37,679
environments

2291
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:40,480
similar to the leave networks emulators

2292
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,320
emulators run real codes with

2293
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,320
interactive network traffic

2294
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,560
similar to simulators emulators can

2295
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,800
support controllable and diverse

2296
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:51,920
topologies and their virtual hardware

2297
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:54,560
requires less resource and compared with

2298
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,000
leave networks

2299
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,639
the the community has many private

2300
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:01,520
efforts such as mines and

2301
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:02,639
other

2302
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:05,679
vm or container-based emulations

2303
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:07,679
but the limitation but the limitation is

2304
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:10,800
that existing emulators inherently lack

2305
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,760
the ability of mimicking leo dynamics

2306
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,920
and time-varying network behaviors in

2307
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,199
istn

2308
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:18,960
for example the high dynamics almost

2309
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,600
global scale and they cannot incorporate

2310
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,760
the unique characters characteristic of

2311
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:26,400
emerging mega constellations

2312
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,280
next page please

2313
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:34,480
so once we have set up an experimental

2314
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:37,440
or laboratory environment next we need

2315
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:40,320
the right test case for the evaluation

2316
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:43,040
the ietf has many discussions and

2317
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,040
standards related through the benchmark

2318
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:47,600
cases for a specific application or

2319
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,000
network for example as projected in this

2320
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,440
slides

2321
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,679
issues as some for example the document

2322
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:55,760
about the test case for evaluating

2323
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:58,000
construction control for

2324
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,400
interactive real-time media or the

2325
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,719
evaluation test case for interactive

2326
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:04,960
real-time media over wireless wireless

2327
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,000
networks

2328
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,639
and also we have some benchmark cases

2329
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:10,480
for data center networks

2330
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,880
but collectively the limitation of these

2331
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,600
test cases is that they mainly focus on

2332
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,400
terrestrial networks and do not

2333
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:22,080
maybe not so suitable for the istn as

2334
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:25,760
they do not incorporate the unix

2335
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:29,199
tie dynamics of istn

2336
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:32,080
next page please

2337
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:33,199
so

2338
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:35,920
given that all these existing approaches

2339
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:38,000
have their limitations on evaluating

2340
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,440
isatn here we summarize the problem

2341
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:44,080
existing evaluation methodologies from

2342
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:47,440
both aerospace and the network community

2343
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,840
may have their limitations and

2344
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:51,639
are insufficient for

2345
01:35:51,639 --> 01:35:53,840
comprehensively and systematically

2346
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,480
evaluating istns

2347
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,959
next page

2348
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,360
so what we also ask a question what are

2349
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:06,239
the requirements of the right evaluation

2350
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:09,280
by storage for istn

2351
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:12,080
so next page

2352
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:15,840
here we conclude by our understanding

2353
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,159
several key requirements for istn

2354
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:20,400
evaluation map storage

2355
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,638
next page

2356
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:27,119
the first requirement should be realism

2357
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:29,679
at least constellation and real network

2358
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:30,800
realism

2359
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:33,760
that means if we create an experimental

2360
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:36,719
environment or an isolated environment

2361
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:38,480
in our terrestrial

2362
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:41,280
laboratory laboratory the terrestrial

2363
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,600
presentation is expected to have the

2364
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,239
same skill and dynamicity like a real

2365
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:48,719
constellation for example in an

2366
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:50,719
experimental environment for studying

2367
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:53,360
satellite network is expected to have

2368
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:56,480
the same size of the experiment nodes

2369
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:57,920
for example

2370
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:00,000
the first shell or

2371
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,600
of the starting phase one has about 1500

2372
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:06,000
satellites so if we build a virtual

2373
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,159
presentation a versus presentation on

2374
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:10,320
the terrestrial environment it is

2375
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:13,199
expected that this that is network

2376
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:16,000
environment can conclude can include

2377
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,000
for example 1500 network nodes

2378
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,639
also it is because it is expected that

2379
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:24,480
the environment can load realistic

2380
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,639
network traffic functionalities

2381
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:29,119
protocols not just the numeric

2382
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:30,800
simulation

2383
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:33,360
next page please

2384
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:36,080
so the second requirements we call it

2385
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:38,880
flexibility at mega constitution scale

2386
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,199
testers may have various experimental

2387
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:43,119
requirements to evaluate various

2388
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:45,440
internetwork technologies under

2389
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,280
different network architectures

2390
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,280
topperage and so on

2391
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:52,400
so the mass storage is expected to

2392
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,360
flexibly support various experimental

2393
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:56,960
situations

2394
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:59,280
in addition consider that the scale of

2395
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,199
mega constellation network could be much

2396
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:02,960
higher larger than many other

2397
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,639
terrestrial networks

2398
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:06,960
for example a satellite network could be

2399
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,360
a global wide area network with

2400
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:12,159
thousands of networks nodes so the map

2401
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:14,880
storage is expected to be scalable to

2402
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,600
mega constellations

2403
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:20,159
next page

2404
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:23,360
and the third requirement could be maybe

2405
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,360
low cost and easy to use

2406
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,760
to advance the progress of isd and

2407
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:30,239
technologies the methodology is expected

2408
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:33,040
to be technically and economically

2409
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,199
feasible for normal researchers and

2410
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:37,040
engineers

2411
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,600
next page

2412
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,840
and the last one is that the methodology

2413
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,880
requires realistic data and test cases

2414
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:49,840
to improve the fidelity and standardize

2415
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,400
the benchmark steps for example

2416
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,119
if the evaluation is driven by realistic

2417
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:57,520
constitutional information and isdn

2418
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:58,400
traffic

2419
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,880
users and user and ground station

2420
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:03,520
distributions it can produce more

2421
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,360
meaningful recommendations concerning

2422
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,840
the key performance characteristics of

2423
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:10,639
internet working

2424
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:14,800
technology next page please

2425
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:17,280
so here uh if we

2426
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:20,080
look forward what we really need is an

2427
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:23,280
evaluation methodology tailored for ists

2428
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:25,280
and how could we design such an

2429
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:27,600
evaluation storage satisfying all the

2430
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,679
requirements above

2431
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:32,400
a viable path might be might be to build

2432
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:35,600
an integrated reality realistic database

2433
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,920
community driven evaluation storage for

2434
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,600
future istm

2435
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,000
here the integration means that we can

2436
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,840
combine leaf facilities simulations and

2437
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,639
emulations together to conduct flexible

2438
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:51,280
and low cost experiments with acceptable

2439
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:52,719
fidelity

2440
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:54,560
data driven here means that the

2441
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:57,679
laboratory environment is expected to be

2442
01:39:57,679 --> 01:40:00,239
driven by real data for example based on

2443
01:40:00,239 --> 01:40:02,320
information of real ground station

2444
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:05,040
satellites orbits and constellations

2445
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:06,320
here we show

2446
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,880
these three pictures should introduce

2447
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:09,679
some

2448
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:11,760
open database for example

2449
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,920
this is the data satellite database of

2450
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:15,679
itu and

2451
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:17,199
an orid

2452
01:40:17,199 --> 01:40:19,920
in this open database you can search the

2453
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:22,000
satellite information for example the

2454
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,639
satellite location i mean latitude

2455
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:27,520
longitude and attitude

2456
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,440
this figure shows that the right figure

2457
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:33,280
the third figure here shows sat nogs

2458
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:35,360
which is an open platform for ground

2459
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:36,800
station networks

2460
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,639
users may purchase a small ground

2461
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,800
station or satellite dish and

2462
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,520
participate this platform by sharing

2463
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:46,239
their ground station data or results to

2464
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:47,920
other participants

2465
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:49,760
so the first third feature might be

2466
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,840
cross sourcing or we can call it

2467
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,960
community driven essentially isdn is a

2468
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,600
wide area network not a private local

2469
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:00,080
area network so creating the right

2470
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:03,040
evaluation storage for isdn needs the

2471
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:05,280
collaboration of the community

2472
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:08,560
the evaluation storage of istn requires

2473
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:11,520
efforts from participates from different

2474
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,760
regions to share or contribute their

2475
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:16,239
test cases and the results

2476
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:17,679
and also

2477
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:19,920
we need the pacific place with different

2478
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,840
domain knowledges for example the

2479
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,920
knowledge from both the aerospace

2480
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:27,600
industry and the network community

2481
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:32,119
let's preach next page please

2482
01:41:32,239 --> 01:41:35,040
if we continue to look at hand who can

2483
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:36,960
benefit from the

2484
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:39,520
social evaluation storage

2485
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,400
for satellite operators such as spacex

2486
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:43,760
or one wipe

2487
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:46,239
they can use this evaluation methodology

2488
01:41:46,239 --> 01:41:48,400
to analyze and understand network

2489
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,960
performance under various constitution

2490
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:53,360
designs for example under different

2491
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:56,480
numbers of satellites and different

2492
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:58,800
orbital heads

2493
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:01,280
second for internet service providers

2494
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:04,960
they can use such uh methodology to

2495
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:09,119
evaluate the reliability latency support

2496
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:10,880
convergence time

2497
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:13,040
and other metrics under various

2498
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:16,239
inter-domain routing protocols

2499
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:18,880
third for content providers they can use

2500
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,000
this math storage to assess the various

2501
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
congestion control mechanisms on the

2502
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,639
network fluctuation which may involved

2503
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:27,440
by

2504
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,679
which may involve non-congestion rtt

2505
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:33,440
violation and packet loss in istns

2506
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,600
also we ask a question what can be

2507
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,199
centralized guys

2508
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:39,440
here we conclude maybe first the

2509
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:41,199
evaluation storage for

2510
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:44,880
ii students and the benchmark steps and

2511
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,000
test case

2512
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,080
and also some maybe the performance

2513
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,320
metrics for stm evaluation for example

2514
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:52,480
constellation utilization

2515
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:53,760
can be

2516
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:57,119
standardized in buy some the draft or

2517
01:42:57,119 --> 01:42:59,360
work

2518
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:02,719
so next page please

2519
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:06,560
so now this is a conclusion page so

2520
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:08,159
let's conclude come through this

2521
01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:09,360
presentation

2522
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:11,119
future integrates space and terrestrial

2523
01:43:11,119 --> 01:43:14,080
networks or stn holds great promise for

2524
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:16,239
pervasive low latency and high

2525
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:18,400
throughput internet service

2526
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,960
but realizing such promise needs the

2527
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:22,880
right evaluation and storage to

2528
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:25,360
comprehensively and systematically

2529
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,679
evaluate and understand new network

2530
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:30,560
designs for istn before the real

2531
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,960
deployment and launch

2532
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:35,199
existing assessment tools or benchmark

2533
01:43:35,199 --> 01:43:37,920
tools plan phones and test cases are

2534
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:41,360
insufficient for comprehensive and

2535
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:44,320
systematic evaluation for ictn and we

2536
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:47,280
need the right evaluation storage turret

2537
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:50,320
for tailored for the future icn for

2538
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,480
example constellation and network

2539
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:55,679
realism flexibility low cost and data

2540
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:57,600
trace and test case

2541
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:59,920
so that's all thank you and

2542
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:02,000
any questions recommendations

2543
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,159
suggestions are more than welcome

2544
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:06,960
thank you and thank you al

2545
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,520
well thank you zeki uh you've you've run

2546
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:12,080
through this uh very efficiently and and

2547
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,480
all your references are available here

2548
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:16,239
uh

2549
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:18,719
yeah so we've we've got all that

2550
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,480
material available

2551
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,440
and

2552
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:24,320
this might be a slide to leave up for uh

2553
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,920
for folks to

2554
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:28,639
kind of refer to let me open the four up

2555
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:32,960
to uh to comments and

2556
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:35,679
if folks have any questions or or

2557
01:44:35,679 --> 01:44:37,520
additional observations they'd like to

2558
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:41,119
make maybe we've got some satellite uh

2559
01:44:41,119 --> 01:44:43,280
well-worth orbit system users out there

2560
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:46,840
who would like to comment

2561
01:44:56,239 --> 01:44:59,360
well i am definitely not qualifying into

2562
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,679
the latter part of al's comment there

2563
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:04,480
but i would ask um you know first thing

2564
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:07,440
this is super interesting

2565
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,760
i'm wondering if you have

2566
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:12,320
uh any participation

2567
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:15,840
from operators or folks who are running

2568
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:18,639
um these satellites um or ist and

2569
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:20,400
networks for for lack of a better term

2570
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:21,199
here

2571
01:45:21,199 --> 01:45:22,560
um

2572
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,320
do you have any involvement from folks

2573
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:25,679
outside of the

2574
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:29,199
uh uh educational forum

2575
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:31,199
okay thank you sarah thank you for this

2576
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:32,400
question

2577
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:35,600
actually our team have been working on

2578
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:39,360
the ice tn for many years and

2579
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,360
as as we have listed in the reference

2580
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:44,159
page so recent uh so over the past

2581
01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:46,960
decades maybe we have some research work

2582
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:48,000
and

2583
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,560
from maybe from paperwork or we also

2584
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:53,280
submit some uh discussion or draft in

2585
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:56,800
the standard group for example itf or iq

2586
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:00,000
and for your question i mean today maybe

2587
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,800
most of our work are done by our groups

2588
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:06,320
but in the future maybe if we can agree

2589
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:07,679
this is a very

2590
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:11,520
uh after after we clarify this problem

2591
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:13,920
statements and requirements if it is

2592
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:16,560
needed we can ask for some further

2593
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:18,800
collaboration maybe with the satellite

2594
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,560
operators or

2595
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:24,080
maybe the cloud operators and the

2596
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:26,960
industry satellite industry

2597
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:31,119
so we can leave it as our future work

2598
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:33,280
yeah i definitely see

2599
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:33,630
um

2600
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:35,760
[Music]

2601
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:37,520
i definitely see some room for

2602
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:39,760
clarification here and we can provide

2603
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:42,480
those comments to you on list right

2604
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:44,560
there is a very high level view of

2605
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:47,360
requirements but i think

2606
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:49,520
getting to the next level down and

2607
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:51,679
merging what you some of what you said

2608
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:54,960
into text would make a lot of sense

2609
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:57,600
um and then i think once there's sort of

2610
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:00,000
a cohesive hey here's what we want to do

2611
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
and here's particularly what we want to

2612
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,920
measure and why

2613
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:06,080
the existing rfcs that we have don't

2614
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:08,159
cover those methodologies

2615
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:10,320
and you've touched on i think your first

2616
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:12,639
bullet point there under looking ahead

2617
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:14,800
for satellite operators is a really

2618
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,560
interesting one

2619
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:19,520
um yeah i think then uh

2620
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:22,000
my based on what i know today ahead of

2621
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,159
the working group taking this on or us

2622
01:47:24,159 --> 01:47:25,920
having a conversation around if we're

2623
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:29,040
the right ones to take this on

2624
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,040
would definitely be around

2625
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,440
hey making sure that there's

2626
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:35,679
a need for this in the industry and it

2627
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:37,679
certainly seems like there is but

2628
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:40,639
getting that feedback directly from

2629
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:43,280
the folks who would own these satellite

2630
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:46,480
or space networks i think is is probably

2631
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:47,760
going to be

2632
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:50,080
key so that we understand hey putting

2633
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:51,840
the time into this

2634
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,000
makes a lot of sense

2635
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,560
and again that's i think a secondary

2636
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:58,639
point to i think there might be a bit of

2637
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,080
a question there over whether or not

2638
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:02,320
we're the right group to do this or not

2639
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:05,600
benchmarking yes it's the uh first

2640
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,679
bullet point on that previous slide that

2641
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:09,679
you were on around hey where the

2642
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:12,239
satellites are positioned at once we

2643
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:14,080
start getting into space specific

2644
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:16,560
technologies it makes me wonder if if

2645
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:19,679
maybe this is very interesting very cool

2646
01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:22,400
and neat but maybe a little bit beyond

2647
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,880
our depths of of current charter or

2648
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:27,119
potentially even the charter that

2649
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:28,800
you know i'm not sure if the ietf itself

2650
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:32,440
could take this on

2651
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:34,320
but i i to be clear

2652
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,400
what i'm proposing is hey

2653
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:39,520
if we have a crisp and clear set of

2654
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,199
problem statements and the requirements

2655
01:48:41,199 --> 01:48:42,639
that you're looking what are you looking

2656
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:45,040
to test and measure and why what we have

2657
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:47,760
today doesn't help i think once that's

2658
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,320
crisp it'll be easy to have or what i

2659
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,080
propose is then we could have that

2660
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,719
conversation around does this make sense

2661
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:56,320
for us

2662
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:58,560
or if you can remove certain things out

2663
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:01,679
of uh out of scope would it make sense

2664
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:02,880
for us

2665
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,560
al i was thinking ahead a little bit

2666
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:05,760
there to

2667
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,920
hey if they want to test you know where

2668
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:09,280
satellites how closely they're

2669
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:11,360
positioned or not or what have you

2670
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:13,920
that's probably way beyond our purview

2671
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,760
but if they remove that from from

2672
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:17,520
purview or make it sort of a a

2673
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:20,639
superfluous detail uh would that change

2674
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:22,960
our stance and and i actually i honestly

2675
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:26,159
don't know i i could take a guess but

2676
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:27,760
i'm proposing that hey we might want to

2677
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:30,800
have that conversation as a group

2678
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:31,599
sure

2679
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:32,480
sure

2680
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:34,320
yeah the yeah the reason the reason i

2681
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:37,280
put this slide back up is that um

2682
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:39,440
you know if you if you take away all the

2683
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,280
all the indications that things are

2684
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:42,800
flying here

2685
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:45,920
and earth stations

2686
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:49,119
there are there's some fundamental

2687
01:49:49,119 --> 01:49:52,560
networking problems uh to solve

2688
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:54,719
and that is um

2689
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:56,880
that there are you know backbone

2690
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:00,000
satellites and relay satellites

2691
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,480
and uh you can think of these as

2692
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:04,400
backbone routers and

2693
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,639
and uh you know uh

2694
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:08,000
uh

2695
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,719
you know maybe uh routers near the edge

2696
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:12,560
but not quite at the edge

2697
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:15,040
and and uh and and then you know you've

2698
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:17,360
got the terrestrial network here where

2699
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:19,679
uh there's there are going to be routers

2700
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:21,679
uh that are connected to the earth

2701
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:24,320
stations that are at the edge of the

2702
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:26,719
network and and there's you know there's

2703
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:29,920
real path benefits that uh path length

2704
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:32,639
uh propagation delay benefits that uh

2705
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:35,199
can be derived from

2706
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:38,639
the additional flexibility that that a

2707
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:42,560
a dense uh leo network uh can provide

2708
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,159
so there's there's

2709
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:45,440
there's clear

2710
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:47,760
there's clear advantages to

2711
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:48,719
uh

2712
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:50,320
you know to this work

2713
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:51,440
on

2714
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:52,560
um

2715
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:53,840
on paper

2716
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:56,480
uh you know from from many uh

2717
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:59,840
perspectives but as as uh zeki lai uh

2718
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,599
mentioned there's there's also a lot of

2719
01:51:01,599 --> 01:51:03,920
expense involved in in building these

2720
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:06,080
networks and maintaining these networks

2721
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:08,159
uh just and you know the main the

2722
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:09,520
maintenance part

2723
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:11,360
is uh is hard

2724
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:14,000
because uh these satellites are in space

2725
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,320
and they can't be uh you know easily

2726
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:18,960
serviced beyond a kind of like a reboot

2727
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:21,760
that uh brings online redundant uh

2728
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:22,880
equipment

2729
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,960
things like that so it's a you know it's

2730
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,840
a it's a cold lonely problem to uh to

2731
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:30,320
try to fix these things and and uh

2732
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:33,040
uh the you know the satellite processors

2733
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:35,840
in space um

2734
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:37,840
i i think you know i think

2735
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:39,599
zeki it might help a little bit for me

2736
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:42,719
to add my personal uh perspective here

2737
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:45,679
uh i spent i spent the first eight years

2738
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:47,520
of my career working in satellite

2739
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,199
communications

2740
01:51:49,199 --> 01:51:50,080
and

2741
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:51,280
and um

2742
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:53,040
back then i mean back then it was the

2743
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,440
late 70s and the early 80s

2744
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:57,360
and so satellite communications was a

2745
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:59,679
lot simpler

2746
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:03,199
and and if we if we involved

2747
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:04,719
pardon

2748
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:06,960
no no i i think that the tradition of

2749
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:08,239
the first generation

2750
01:52:08,239 --> 01:52:10,320
network is mainly based on the

2751
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,880
geostationary system

2752
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:14,719
that's right that's right

2753
01:52:14,719 --> 01:52:15,599
um

2754
01:52:15,599 --> 01:52:16,719
but the

2755
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:18,960
but the most i think the most important

2756
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:21,760
uh part of it was that um

2757
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:24,880
we found ways that we could test in

2758
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,880
test the satellite network

2759
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:29,840
in the laboratory

2760
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,199
uh

2761
01:52:31,199 --> 01:52:34,320
with without some of the

2762
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:36,880
without some of the pieces let me let me

2763
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:39,199
let me just put it that way um

2764
01:52:39,199 --> 01:52:40,000
we

2765
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,480
we had a laboratory where we could test

2766
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:44,960
all of the ground-based systems

2767
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:46,719
and the um

2768
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:48,639
uh you know and the and the networks

2769
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:50,320
that connected up to the satellite

2770
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:51,599
network

2771
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:54,320
and all of the frequency conversion and

2772
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:56,840
then maybe the big surprise is that we

2773
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:58,560
had um

2774
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:01,199
the actual what they called the brass

2775
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:04,639
board version of the satellites

2776
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:06,800
and so we were we dispensed with

2777
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:09,520
antennas and high-powered amplifiers but

2778
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:11,840
we connected right up to the right up to

2779
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:14,719
the functional satellite with uh uh you

2780
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:16,480
know using waveguide

2781
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:19,760
and um uh you know that was a and that

2782
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:21,679
was a very valuable thing to do because

2783
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:22,880
very often

2784
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,719
most of the questions we were asking had

2785
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:27,440
to do with you know how many how many

2786
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,440
channels can we get going on this

2787
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:30,880
satellite with this new form of

2788
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:34,400
modulation and and and so forth and and

2789
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:37,199
finally we did bring in some um antenna

2790
01:53:37,199 --> 01:53:39,760
based uh testing uh with the third

2791
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:42,080
generation of the satellites that that

2792
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:45,040
we tested we ended up with two two big

2793
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:48,080
brass board versions of the uh

2794
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:51,599
of the satellites uh there with um

2795
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:54,159
a traveling wave tube and

2796
01:53:54,159 --> 01:53:57,040
silicon based uh amplifiers you know the

2797
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:59,119
technology changed over time

2798
01:53:59,119 --> 01:54:00,560
um

2799
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:02,960
it was uh i mean

2800
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:05,440
all i'm saying is there were ways to

2801
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,719
scale down

2802
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:08,880
from the you know the

2803
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:10,480
the complexity

2804
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:12,080
of uh

2805
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:13,360
actual

2806
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:15,199
satellite uh

2807
01:54:15,199 --> 01:54:17,840
live network usage and and still get

2808
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:20,159
very meaningful results

2809
01:54:20,159 --> 01:54:22,639
so um you know that's the challenge that

2810
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:26,480
we would be faced with here in in uh uh

2811
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:28,320
trying to get this working

2812
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,719
in a laboratory and in a benchmarking

2813
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:33,440
kind of environment that we could uh uh

2814
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:35,679
that we could call on and maybe that's

2815
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:37,520
the kind of thing that that would only

2816
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:41,040
answer a limited uh range of questions

2817
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:43,760
but it still might be uh it still might

2818
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:45,840
be useful to go after that

2819
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:48,159
so uh you could imagine

2820
01:54:48,159 --> 01:54:50,000
um you know i've been i've been thinking

2821
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,239
about the the dynamics of this here the

2822
01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:55,440
the dynamics of the the multiple shells

2823
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:58,719
of uh the orbits that are talked about i

2824
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:00,560
mean all the all the orbits you're

2825
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:01,760
talking about are

2826
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:04,400
are higher than the international space

2827
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:05,679
station

2828
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:08,560
and and the international space station

2829
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:12,239
is at uh 220 miles

2830
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:14,800
about 330 kilometers or something like

2831
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:18,320
that and and it traverses the visible

2832
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:19,360
sky

2833
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:22,320
in less than a minute it it really seems

2834
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:23,840
to fly by

2835
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:25,360
um

2836
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:27,840
you're talking about uh the low earth

2837
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:30,960
orbit with uh three minute visibility so

2838
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:33,199
that's uh i mean that's a that's

2839
01:55:33,199 --> 01:55:34,960
actually a big step up you could you

2840
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:36,560
could potentially use you know one

2841
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:38,480
satellite for three minutes

2842
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:39,360
um

2843
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:41,520
and that starts to give you the kind of

2844
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:43,679
um

2845
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:45,840
you know the pace of of connection

2846
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:48,960
changing that that's going on also um i

2847
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:51,760
attended a workshop uh back in september

2848
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:54,560
and at the end of the workshop uh one of

2849
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:56,080
the participants who'd been you know

2850
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:58,400
very active very vocal and and uh you

2851
01:55:58,400 --> 01:56:01,760
know really nice guy uh

2852
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:04,320
uh he he revealed to us that he was

2853
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:07,760
using a a leo satellite service

2854
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:09,119
and yeah we did see a couple of

2855
01:56:09,119 --> 01:56:11,280
interruptions when he was speaking and

2856
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,599
and things like that but no no more than

2857
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:15,119
what you see when

2858
01:56:15,119 --> 01:56:16,480
you know when somebody's trying to use

2859
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:19,599
the terrestrial background so so i i

2860
01:56:19,599 --> 01:56:21,599
thought that was quite amazing he walked

2861
01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:23,679
around the the farm where he was and

2862
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:26,159
showed us the dish up on on top of a

2863
01:56:26,159 --> 01:56:28,000
barn and stuff like that it was really

2864
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:28,800
cool

2865
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:31,360
so um you know this this stuff is a

2866
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,599
reality right now that's the most

2867
01:56:33,599 --> 01:56:35,599
important comment i wanted to make and

2868
01:56:35,599 --> 01:56:37,119
and uh

2869
01:56:37,119 --> 01:56:40,080
it's it's it's just a matter of of uh

2870
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:43,840
designing the right uh

2871
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:46,400
you know uh a scope of testing that

2872
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:48,639
would produce some meaningful benchmarks

2873
01:56:48,639 --> 01:56:51,840
and uh and reasonable results i think i

2874
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:53,440
and i'm i'm you know we're getting close

2875
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:54,960
to the end so i'll give you the last

2876
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:57,760
words here uh seki

2877
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:00,000
okay thank you al and thank you sarah

2878
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,679
thank you very much for all your

2879
01:57:01,679 --> 01:57:02,719
comments

2880
01:57:02,719 --> 01:57:05,360
so i want uh here maybe

2881
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:08,320
let me explain why we want to

2882
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:10,639
submit this draft because

2883
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:14,159
uh during our previous studies in

2884
01:57:14,159 --> 01:57:17,040
istn we found that there are a lot of

2885
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:19,520
internet working technology

2886
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:22,880
and challenges facing the istm because

2887
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:24,719
as we have introduced before the the

2888
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:26,719
high dynamics and the constraint

2889
01:57:26,719 --> 01:57:29,040
resource and the low the high

2890
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:30,480
operational cost

2891
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:34,320
so if we uh if we want to unleash

2892
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:36,960
such a lot of potential of the istn for

2893
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:38,639
example pervasive

2894
01:57:38,639 --> 01:57:41,360
connectivity low latency and throughput

2895
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:44,159
we need a lot of new research and we

2896
01:57:44,159 --> 01:57:47,520
know the experimental or the evaluation

2897
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:50,000
storage play a very important role

2898
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,080
during the evolution in the evolution of

2899
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:54,560
our internet so we believe the same

2900
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,800
thing for istn we need the right

2901
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:59,520
evaluation methodology and test case for

2902
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:03,360
the istn to evaluate evaluate a lot of

2903
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:05,520
internet working technologies

2904
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:08,000
we would believe that that fits the

2905
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,639
charter of the bmw

2906
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:13,360
so that is why we write loads we wrote

2907
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:15,840
this draft and some here

2908
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:18,800
but i also agree with sarah that

2909
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:22,000
maybe we need some clarifications for

2910
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,520
the problem requirements and the most

2911
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:27,280
most important maybe the performance

2912
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:28,239
metric

2913
01:58:28,239 --> 01:58:29,360
for example

2914
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:31,280
whether we can use the traditional

2915
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:34,159
metrics like the latency or support

2916
01:58:34,159 --> 01:58:37,920
coverage and other metrics to quantify

2917
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:38,639
the

2918
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:41,520
performance of the benchmark of the isdn

2919
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:44,239
or maybe we need to seek for some

2920
01:58:44,239 --> 01:58:47,760
new specific metrics for istn maybe

2921
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:50,239
like the constellation just i have very

2922
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:51,119
simple

2923
01:58:51,119 --> 01:58:53,440
question for example starlink has

2924
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,880
already launched about

2925
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:59,119
1500 satellites in the orbit and they

2926
01:58:59,119 --> 01:59:03,000
plan to launch for example

2927
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:07,119
43 thousands of satellites but

2928
01:59:07,119 --> 01:59:10,239
how many satellites really we need to

2929
01:59:10,239 --> 01:59:12,800
support the global internet so what is

2930
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:14,960
the constellation utilization and how

2931
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:17,920
can we evaluate manning the network

2932
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:20,639
performance from the network perspective

2933
01:59:20,639 --> 01:59:23,760
of istn so such metric or

2934
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:26,159
such test case and benchmark methodology

2935
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:28,320
can guide us to

2936
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:31,440
construct the future istn

2937
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:33,520
so that is why we

2938
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:35,679
want to roll this draft and submit this

2939
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:37,360
draft to this group

2940
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:40,639
and i'm very happy to if i can get some

2941
01:59:40,639 --> 01:59:42,960
further recommendations or suggestions

2942
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:46,960
from the chair of the and other bmw

2943
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:49,760
folks so you are more than welcome to

2944
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:52,560
give any questions recommendations and

2945
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:54,560
suggestions from

2946
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:57,360
the mail list or just direct mail to me

2947
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:59,520
thank you

2948
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:01,360
well you're very welcome thank you and

2949
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:02,400
and um

2950
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:04,560
you know i think i think one of the

2951
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,400
one of the other points that came up is

2952
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:08,560
is if we can recruit

2953
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:10,080
some um

2954
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:12,639
new members of the audience uh from

2955
02:00:12,639 --> 02:00:15,599
these uh new networking uh providers the

2956
02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:16,800
the space

2957
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:20,159
uh leo network providers uh i mean that

2958
02:00:20,159 --> 02:00:22,000
would that would give us a real leg up

2959
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,560
in uh trying to make the decisions of

2960
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:26,960
what's valuable to this audience

2961
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:27,760
and

2962
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:30,000
what would they like to know now

2963
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,239
and

2964
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:34,320
what uh how would this help them choose

2965
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:37,599
the equipment they want to

2966
02:00:38,159 --> 02:00:40,719
add to their networks and and modify

2967
02:00:40,719 --> 02:00:43,199
existing protocols and so forth so these

2968
02:00:43,199 --> 02:00:45,840
are the kinds of questions that um

2969
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:48,880
you know we could uh

2970
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:52,400
possibly begin to help with in uh in

2971
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:54,960
bmwg but but there's a there's a ways to

2972
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:57,440
go here i i mean most of most of what i

2973
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:59,599
hear is is research and i think uh i

2974
02:00:59,599 --> 02:01:02,080
think everyone would generally agree uh

2975
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:04,239
agree with that at you know at this

2976
02:01:04,239 --> 02:01:06,480
exact point of time although you know

2977
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:08,159
there are production networks out there

2978
02:01:08,159 --> 02:01:10,159
so that's the you know that that's the

2979
02:01:10,159 --> 02:01:13,040
other side of it uh yeah it's uh

2980
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:15,599
it's it's it's it's way way out of the

2981
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:17,440
lab it's uh people are using these

2982
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:20,800
things right now and and 40 4500

2983
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:22,960
satellites is nothing to sneeze at

2984
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:24,239
so um

2985
02:01:24,239 --> 02:01:25,440
very good

2986
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:27,119
all right um

2987
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:29,280
so we're a little bit over time but i

2988
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:31,440
i'm really glad that in this session we

2989
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:34,080
had some chance to uh uh give some extra

2990
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:37,199
time to this techie because uh uh

2991
02:01:37,199 --> 02:01:38,880
you know this it just happened to work

2992
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:41,199
out that um we had some extra time in

2993
02:01:41,199 --> 02:01:43,520
this uh in this session to handle it so

2994
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:44,719
um

2995
02:01:44,719 --> 02:01:46,639
usually we don't

2996
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:49,280
so it's worked out well all right well

2997
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:50,880
we encourage you to keep working on it

2998
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:53,760
and um uh try to try to draw in some uh

2999
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:56,960
audience members and then we'll uh uh

3000
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:59,199
you know from the industry and then

3001
02:01:59,199 --> 02:02:02,239
we'll um take it from there thank you

3002
02:02:02,239 --> 02:02:03,760
thank you pressure

3003
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:05,840
and thank you

3004
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:06,960
okay

3005
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:09,840
so um uh at the end of our agenda any

3006
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:12,400
other business

3007
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:18,880
okay well thanks very much for

3008
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:21,360
participating today everybody uh it was

3009
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:24,080
a useful session and uh we shared a lot

3010
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:26,639
of uh information and

3011
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:29,520
test results and um

3012
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:31,599
progress and i think that uh that's what

3013
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:33,840
we're always looking for here uh during

3014
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:35,040
our sessions

3015
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:36,239
so again

3016
02:02:36,239 --> 02:02:38,320
uh thank you we'll see on the mailing

3017
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:39,199
list

3018
02:02:39,199 --> 02:02:42,638
and um bye for now

3019
02:02:43,119 --> 02:02:46,440
thanks folks

3020
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:53,840
you
