1
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,200
okay we've reached the top of the hour

2
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,520
and reaching the usual this is third

3
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,000
session on thursday and people are

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
slowly trickling in

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,600
give people one last chance to test

6
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,880
their microphones before we kick off

7
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,439
hi jeff this is

8
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,880
can you hear me

9
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,520
in june we can hear you fine thank you

10
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,920
thank you

11
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,400
okay care take it away

12
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,360
good morning good afternoon good evening

13
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,360
folks welcome to the second and the

14
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,640
final session of idr 112.

15
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,560
uh we have

16
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,240
a note well here uh please read this

17
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,520
carefully

18
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,759
please note what it means is you are

19
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,479
bounded by this rules that are out here

20
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,880
and many more that are described in

21
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,840
the bcps

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,160
we also have

23
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,720
a code of conduct guidelines that we

24
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,720
request you to follow

25
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,680
both at mic as well as on the jabber

26
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,760
and then any im messages that you've

27
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,319
been doing yeah

28
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,319
on the agenda today we have about uh six

29
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,640
presentations we have a psap

30
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,280
presentation coming from agent we have

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,360
dynamic capabilities

32
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,760
um the draft that has been resurrected

33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,440
by nk

34
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,360
it's actually a working group draft that

35
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,000
mk is going to present again we have a

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,160
variant of multi-session on a different

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,440
transport

38
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,160
quick uh that's going to be presented by

39
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,360
yinzhan

40
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,080
um there is a draft on 5g

41
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,319
computing app metadata that linda is

42
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,400
going to talk about hype is going to

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,640
talk about revised error handling draft

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,400
and finally we got a new

45
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
draft at the last minute draft

46
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,760
presentation

47
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,879
on flow specifications for devnet that

48
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,200
quan is going to be presenting so any

49
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
questions on edge in the bashing before

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,959
we start

51
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,519
fantastic

52
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,920
agent

53
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,000
yeah

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,440
hi hi slide slide

55
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
i can move this i can i can change the

56
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,239
slides for you just let me know when

57
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,879
okay okay

58
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,440
so

59
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,920
okay so uh i think you you can

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,400
change it so the the motivation for this

61
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,319
practitioner is one for

62
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,000
uh we want to

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,560
the working progress within the pc

64
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,760
working group but it is related to the

65
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,319
idr so we want to the id are expert and

66
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,680
also the deal

67
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,560
so

68
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,720
the solution is

69
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,798
based the other two rc the first they

70
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,639
have published the described scenario

71
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,358
and the simulation reload for the te in

72
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,080
network network the second

73
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,479
published rfc describes the architecture

74
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,360
to

75
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,280
for providing the traffic engineering in

76
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,840
your natural hype network by using the

77
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,759
multi pdp session and a pc based control

78
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,840
a sensor function mechanism so this

79
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,800
document just describes the

80
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,360
precipitation

81
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,240
and the procedures to practically build

82
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,759
such mechanisms

83
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,919
build such architecture okay next slide

84
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,080
okay let's let's start this

85
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,639
sorry agent can i pause you for a second

86
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,000
oh okay

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,360
uh thank you so

88
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,440
agent can i pause you agent can i pause

89
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,120
you for a second um folks we i

90
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,280
i i apologize but we need someone to

91
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,559
take minutes gee

92
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,880
in case we don't get a minute

93
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,080
taker will you please take minutes

94
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,919
g

95
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,440
okay thank you jay um agent please

96
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,800
continue

97
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,000
okay so uh this is uh overall solution

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,120
so we just uh

99
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,120
utilize the this is the solution is

100
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,560
based on the

101
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,960
sensor controller so we also want to

102
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,240
utilize the traditional pgp session so

103
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,960
there are many main three steps to you

104
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,800
know accomplish the task the first is we

105
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,520
want to um we should build the skill or

106
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,280
multiple sessions between edge water uh

107
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,639
open uh open request from the pcb the

108
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,120
overall aim of the solution is to

109
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,639
uh

110
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,639
differentiate the traffic between to end

111
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,680
so so the first step is to build

112
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,080
the several pdp session between the edge

113
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,120
router

114
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,639
of the request

115
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,520
and

116
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
the second is

117
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,240
advertised different prefix by the even

118
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,880
the pdp session with the pc

119
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,840
p7

120
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,960
[Music]

121
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,240
piece of message

122
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,160
the third is

123
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,919
we should steer traffic towards the

124
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,520
particular route by the pgp next hop

125
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,080
with the anticipated message

126
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,719
okay next

127
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,880
so uh here is the detailed procedure for

128
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,400
the three step

129
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,800
you know if we want to different the

130
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,880
traffic between the harvard and r7 so we

131
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,039
should first

132
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,319
build the

133
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,520
uh build uh for example 2 btp session

134
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,720
between r1 and r7

135
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,919
and the

136
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:18,720
uh

137
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,520
two alternators we

138
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,680
just downloaded the pdpr information

139
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,800
object

140
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,479
uh that is the ppi of from the pc here

141
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,800
to let the uh

142
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,759
letter r r and r seven

143
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,240
build the two pg sensor the the main

144
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,319
information within the

145
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,440
millions this object is the qrs number

146
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,319
and the local pure address and the

147
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,800
tunnel source has been addressed this is

148
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,240
similar in the

149
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,199
normal pgp session setup

150
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,879
requirement okay next slide

151
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,199
so after the uh the pgp says the multi

152
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,599
physics has been established

153
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,080
we can

154
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,479
let the

155
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,520
letter

156
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,039
edge rotor

157
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,759
to advertise the different prefix via

158
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,240
the different big session so

159
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,599
we should

160
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,680
send the explained peer route object

161
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,479
uh

162
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,319
oh sorry

163
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,400
sorry this is not a no no no no

164
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,759
the second

165
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,319
step is

166
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,479
the second step is

167
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,959
we should

168
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,120
uh explicitly expressly

169
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,399
point out the the the path

170
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,000
from the

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,760
the password pgp next hop from r1 to r7

172
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,320
so we should send the explicit peer

173
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,760
route object

174
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,640
from the pc to the edge to the total

175
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,040
water on the on the

176
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,320
floating path

177
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,800
for example r1 are

178
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,920
6 r8 r5 okay uh and the the main

179
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,640
information including the object has a

180
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,080
root priority and the purchase of this

181
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
and the next problem with the

182
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,279
pure tunnel

183
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,560
uh destiny audition

184
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,040
next slide please okay yeah yeah the the

185
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,519
third the third step is uh

186
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,480
because we have filled the uh different

187
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,519
video session between the edge router

188
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,880
we we

189
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,160
should

190
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,920
let the

191
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,760
edge rotor advertise the different

192
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,480
prefix from for millions of different

193
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,399
video tests

194
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,320
so we should

195
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,240
send the pure prefix advertisement

196
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,360
object to the edge router the aim of

197
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,959
such a object is

198
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,200
just that as i described that you know

199
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,640
let's the

200
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,279
edge rotor uh advertise the different

201
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,000
prefix for the twist appear

202
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,120
while the different video tests are so

203
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,160
uh based on these three steps

204
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,600
uh

205
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,640
every router will receive the

206
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,760
uh

207
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,519
this unit prefix

208
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,279
but the

209
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,800
next job was for this prefix has been

210
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,600
changed by the

211
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,360
expire ex by the second step

212
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,040
so the the overall folding path on the

213
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,399
on the path on the water will be also

214
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,519
changed

215
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,880
so that is the the final result is the

216
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,240
normal traffic

217
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,160
and the priority traffic will default on

218
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,600
a different path

219
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,440
so this so

220
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,839
so we can achieve with the the different

221
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:02,959
course

222
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,600
requirement okay this is uh overall

223
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,720
solution

224
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,519
next i think

225
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,600
[Music]

226
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,959
so the information transferred in this

227
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,240
job is mainly used for the uh the first

228
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,720
is the lightweight pdp session setup

229
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,079
uh the second is the x place explicitly

230
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,120
root deployment this explicit result is

231
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,640
through the pgp next hub not to the um

232
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,760
prefix so it can reduce the border on

233
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,640
the on the internal loader and the third

234
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,560
is the the prefix distribution by the by

235
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,120
the pc file preset

236
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,440
so uh under the planning policies and

237
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,600
the distribution of the products within

238
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,959
it

239
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,200
should be done in advance

240
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,560
okay next slide

241
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,279
so uh we we want to

242
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,720
uh ask the

243
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,200
expert within idr

244
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,079
to for the overall solution let's use

245
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,240
the lightweight bgp session

246
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,959
and

247
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,519
and we are also prepared for the working

248
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,079
group working good classical both in the

249
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,440
rdr and the pc pc working group thank

250
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,440
you

251
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,279
thank you agent any questions for agent

252
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,519
so jeff uh this is yet another draft

253
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,120
that will need a collaboration between

254
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,920
pc working group uh as well as idea i

255
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,760
believe

256
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,279
absolutely so

257
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,200
what we should be doing is uh we'll add

258
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,519
this to the wiki of things that

259
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,440
need to be tracked across working groups

260
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,200
and additionally we'll

261
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,040
you know try to find a time

262
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,720
for working group last call to be shared

263
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,440
across idr and get chair review as well

264
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,839
and we'll try to get you some form of

265
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,600
deadline likely the week after etf

266
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,360
okay

267
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,240
i also welcome any comment

268
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,839
in the medium idea mail list for the

269
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,959
for my and this

270
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,800
for the future

271
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,040
okay

272
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,959
i think

273
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,120
this slider need not be off should i use

274
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,920
it in slide

275
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,120
this is just for the backup

276
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,600
music

277
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,760
any questions for

278
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,560
agent folks

279
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,880
thank you agent

280
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,880
okay

281
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,519
the next speaker is donal

282
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,120
for flow specification version two

283
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,720
hi uh this is donald

284
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,839
um

285
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,800
sue harris is not available due to some

286
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,079
medical problems so i'm just going to

287
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,600
give a very brief

288
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,360
uh presentation

289
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,079
uh about what's going on with the ptp

290
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,320
flow spec version two

291
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,279
next slide please

292
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,639
so uh just an introduction for people

293
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,079
who haven't seen this most people i'm

294
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,920
sure have full spec is about the

295
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,160
distribution of filters that this is a

296
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,560
packet match criterion and resulting

297
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,199
actions it's about a number of existing

298
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,839
applications and the initial motivating

299
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,760
application was dos mitigation but it's

300
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,680
been used for other things as well and

301
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,360
there exists a flow spec version one

302
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,880
defined in

303
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,160
rfcs

304
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,240
listed on this slide and some working

305
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,959
group graphs and the idea is that future

306
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,279
efforts would be directed to

307
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,160
version two because of the problems that

308
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,760
have been found in full effect version

309
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,399
one and there's no consistent

310
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,560
tlv encoding so extensibility is

311
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,240
difficult because you can't skip over

312
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,680
things you don't

313
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
know the type of because there's no

314
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
consistent length encoding

315
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,000
there's a difficulties there's no user

316
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,639
or way in general to specify the order

317
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,079
for the

318
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,440
application of filters or actions

319
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,360
in case you have different peers who

320
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,279
have different levels of support for

321
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,839
slow spec currently either supporting or

322
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,000
not supporting fsv1 and

323
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,600
i guess in the future

324
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,440
and supporting or not sporting

325
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,480
fs v1 or fsv2 or both

326
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,240
uh those as peers with these different

327
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,399
levels support interact wasn't specified

328
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,040
so fsv2 solves uh data to solve these

329
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,440
problems excuse me and it uses a new

330
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,680
saffies to keep itself separated from

331
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,079
ssv fsv1

332
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,560
next slide please

333
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,199
so there's a version three draft as

334
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,839
posted uh i'd like to welcome two more

335
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,000
authors to this draft

336
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,959
uh

337
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,800
titania and sven

338
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,440
and uh this is a considerable

339
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,199
expansion to the ver zero two draft uh

340
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,360
the draft is uh

341
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,279
becoming somewhat more mature but it's i

342
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,440
don't think it's mature yet

343
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,079
uh that went from 22 to 57 pages that's

344
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,839
just the body text

345
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,920
ignoring the references section

346
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,440
there's more on improved material in

347
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,839
almost all the sections particularly

348
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,759
material related to ordering including

349
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,480
ordering between the rules received

350
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,120
via fsp1 and fsv2

351
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,079
more control over the

352
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,880
way that failures are treated in a chain

353
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,720
of actions that are applicable to the

354
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,279
same particular filter

355
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,120
uh some more

356
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,799
material expanded on how validation both

357
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,839
against routing uh determine whether

358
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,839
some fs should be

359
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,959
ignored or uh put into effect and also

360
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,520
cryptographic validation and there's uh

361
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,880
now a section on manageability

362
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,359
there's really lots of uh changes here

363
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,079
uh

364
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,280
sort of

365
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,799
in uh

366
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,959
but i decided to the

367
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,960
brief report would probably be uh

368
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,039
appropriate in this case and

369
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,320
hopefully this report will be short

370
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,080
enough that her time will be available

371
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,120
for for other uh items at this idr

372
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,080
meeting

373
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,639
next slide

374
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,600
so there is work progressing on a more

375
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,640
mature

376
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,840
version four draft uh any comments on

377
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,640
the

378
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,400
version three drafts would be welcome uh

379
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,640
a lot of comments were received and

380
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,440
they're

381
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,919
uh included in the

382
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,240
uh being included in the version four

383
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,600
drafts at the extent

384
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,559
can

385
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,480
and there is a

386
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,320
a idr

387
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,160
virtual meeting scheduled for 13

388
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,799
december which on the tentative agenda

389
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,520
is sent out includes uh the topic of

390
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,360
flow spec v2

391
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,440
so i would

392
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,600
think that would be a good place to

393
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,760
think that we will be talking about all

394
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,840
of this in much more detail

395
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,760
so that is my effectively a status

396
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,559
report on on fsv2

397
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,960
i have any i'm welcome to

398
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,880
have any questions people like to answer

399
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,640
ask and i'll see if i can can answer

400
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,799
them

401
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,600
thanks donald um

402
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,400
this is a pretty serious work that's

403
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,480
coming up it's got it's very

404
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,880
comprehensive so we do urge

405
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,320
both operator

406
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,080
both the operator community as well as

407
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,000
the developers to take a closer look at

408
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,840
this and provide as many comments as

409
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,520
they can upfront to

410
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,679
donal another co-authors

411
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,240
questions for donald

412
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,799
thank you

413
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,280
thank you so much

414
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,039
the next on the list is dynamic

415
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,679
capabilities for bgp this has been a

416
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,640
working group draft for a while um

417
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,760
it's been

418
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,840
back with updates and case gonna talk

419
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,919
about it thank you

420
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,799
hi gio hi everybody can you hear me

421
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,440
we can hear you thank you okay okay

422
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,440
all right uh so uh

423
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,679
this is anchor chain from palo alto

424
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,200
networks and the courser is the srihari

425
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,799
from juniper

426
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,080
and next slide please

427
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,520
so this uh yeah as a queue we just

428
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,840
mentioned uh this

429
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,400
document has been there uh for for a

430
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,200
while actually for for a number of years

431
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,120
uh version 14.

432
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,360
i think there are several reasons that

433
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,760
draft has not been re has not been

434
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,880
refreshed before because we've failed to

435
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,080
my reason was that we felt the the

436
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,720
the spec was stable and actually there

437
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,960
was a it's really waiting for the

438
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,480
implementations

439
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,280
uh

440
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,480
so we we also we have to apologize we

441
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,000
got lazy didn't do that didn't do the

442
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,320
necessary work to refresh it

443
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,470
and so we have been made

444
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,799
[Music]

445
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,799
aware that they have

446
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,280
there have been multiple implementations

447
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,559
over the years

448
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,120
the capabilities are being supported at

449
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,080
the address families and also the gr

450
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,880
uh they are certainly uh i think the

451
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,360
multiple implementation on the gr

452
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,159
that is uh that is that was you know

453
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,840
it's if you look at the original

454
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,559
motivation was really for enabling

455
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,400
disabled address families for

456
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,320
provisioning and this later at the gr

457
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,200
came in the support came in and it would

458
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,960
dynamically

459
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,039
revise the timers

460
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,559
for the gr in the case of

461
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,120
applied maintenance

462
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,880
so over the last

463
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,080
uh couple years there there were we

464
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,120
received a the authors

465
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,320
received

466
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,760
a couple comments from implementors

467
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,360
on the draft

468
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,320
and

469
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,640
so it is uh

470
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,679
it's a

471
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,159
that's that's the reason for the recent

472
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,840
update

473
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,720
next slide please

474
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,799
so we

475
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,840
so we basically we decide to basically

476
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,960
to post two versions

477
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,480
of the draft

478
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,440
uh the first versions is really because

479
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,440
it has been a number of years and they

480
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,960
there has been a lot of change in the

481
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,880
template so the the version 15 is all

482
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,120
about template changes so that way we

483
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,520
can minimize

484
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,039
the basically protocol changes or

485
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,000
clarification in the version 16. so this

486
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,880
update is really about the 16.

487
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,120
so in version 16

488
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,799
here are the changes

489
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,159
and why

490
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,559
area is the classification or the

491
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,280
multiple instance capability

492
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,120
so this uh

493
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,080
so this clarifies that each for such

494
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,960
capability the instance each instance

495
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,919
should be

496
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,159
revised individually

497
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,960
currently really the only only the

498
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,520
address family belongs to this category

499
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,440
i think it's really for historical

500
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,480
reasons

501
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,360
because the capability less

502
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,679
is defined as the four bytes

503
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,840
it's not instead of multiples of four

504
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,799
bytes

505
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,280
that's why if you look at this uh

506
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,320
the capability advertisement in the open

507
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,520
is really listed individually

508
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,240
the

509
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,760
the afr sub efi is in four bytes field

510
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,640
and instead of the tovs

511
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,039
right so this make it very difficult if

512
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,200
you look at multi protocols later it

513
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,159
declarified it the explained quite a bit

514
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,919
of text on this

515
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,640
talking about this multiple instance

516
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,120
it's mostly historical we have to deal

517
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,919
with that because the length is 4 bytes

518
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,440
it's not in multiples for us

519
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,000
and also this uh

520
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,360
because now

521
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:55,570
uh

522
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,880
[Music]

523
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,279
to further clarify because we if we have

524
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,880
to talk about multiple instance

525
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,240
capabilities then this is a we also have

526
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,600
to talk about single instance

527
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,640
capabilities so there's also we clarify

528
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,159
that for the single instance

529
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,720
capabilities basically this whole

530
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,720
capability is revised

531
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,600
uh you know there's only one instance

532
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,000
right every time you add you want to you

533
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,880
want to uh modify a one field for

534
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,679
example timer you have to advertise the

535
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,080
whole thing right it's a replacement of

536
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,559
the pre the whole capability as a whole

537
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,600
right

538
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,559
and also the the the the one

539
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,720
clarification is basically how do you

540
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
remove

541
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,360
uh this single instance capability what

542
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,000
will be length because the capability

543
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,360
you have

544
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,200
uh you have the type you have lengths

545
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,440
you have the body so this here you

546
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,600
clarify although this is i think that's

547
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,360
what people have been doing

548
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,640
it's basically when you when you remove

549
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,200
when you remove a capability the lens

550
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,799
field should be set to zero

551
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,919
next slide please

552
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,600
so

553
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,720
i think several people also suggested uh

554
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,000
you know

555
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,039
have a question about uh you know what

556
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,039
capability to support

557
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,760
if you look at the spec uh starting from

558
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,400
version five uh basically the protocol

559
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,279
extensions is it's generic

560
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,600
it's really not limited to specific

561
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,559
capabilities there is enough protocol

562
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,039
machinery to deal with the capability

563
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,840
changes generically

564
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,919
so this this

565
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:38,640
is

566
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,799
we we felt that basically what

567
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,720
capabilities support

568
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,559
will be

569
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,080
designed

570
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,000
by the implementers either by the

571
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,840
customers basically and so this here we

572
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,120
add this uh section as suggested by

573
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,279
several people i think including john

574
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,120
sterner at the gs

575
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,440
basically we say

576
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,520
we should be selective

577
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,320
on the capability that to be supported

578
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,080
because due to the

579
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,600
complexities

580
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,960
that might

581
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,600
you be involved for some of the conflict

582
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,679
for some of the capabilities

583
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:16,799
clearly

584
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,440
you know that not all capabilities are

585
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,080
equal right some are much somewhat

586
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,240
simple some are more complex so there

587
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,159
are trade-offs

588
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,120
so it's

589
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,559
it's

590
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,440
it's it's hard to it's hard to say okay

591
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
what probability

592
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,080
uh should be supported or should not be

593
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,640
supported as an example we didn't when

594
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,600
we started right we didn't

595
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,559
think of gr would come into play right

596
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,039
uh to it's something that needs to be

597
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,400
revised dynamically it so

598
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,559
especially in the future if the new

599
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,279
capabilities and that will likely be

600
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,559
introduced so it's very it's it's it's

601
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,720
it's

602
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,480
we feel that it's it's difficult and

603
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,120
it's it's also not necessary to

604
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,279
basically to uh

605
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,720
to exclude

606
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,440
the support of certain capability i mean

607
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,360
we that basically

608
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,919
is left with the implementation and to

609
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,559
the to the to the market

610
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,840
right next slide please

611
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,600
so what here are the next steps

612
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,720
so uh

613
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,440
so

614
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,039
so so just just last week uh i think

615
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,960
that i and i basically uh did a review

616
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,159
on the on the 16th version 16 and also

617
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,880
jtf did a detailed review so there were

618
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,679
a couple issues actually identified

619
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,399
one is the capability message type

620
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,799
this has this basically

621
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,520
it's defined as a six that would remain

622
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,679
that is uh that is

623
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,000
there's no need to change that

624
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
that that's good news and but as ayanna

625
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,720
editor basically uh

626
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,520
recommended we should not say it is is

627
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,080
defined as a six instead we will say

628
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,399
suggested value six

629
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,080
and also the

630
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,880
gifts part is this one and the error

631
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,440
code actually conflicts with the error

632
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,399
code

633
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,000
allocated for

634
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,720
uh

635
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,200
for extended enhanced run refresh

636
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,679
capability i think the reason is that

637
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,360
because this chapter has been there for

638
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,320
a long time the uh the other draft

639
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,360
basically

640
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,679
uh got ahead of this one

641
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,880
and i think this trial as i recorded

642
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,559
you know this

643
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,240
we didn't

644
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,799
i think we didn't have a rigorous

645
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,000
procedure for early anal allocation

646
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,200
years ago

647
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
and so it's just that we just

648
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,000
sequentially putting a number there and

649
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,080
that is certainly that is causing

650
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,760
problem and

651
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,760
the new value we need to be allocated we

652
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,600
will need to work with the chairs

653
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,720
together early allocation so that

654
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,520
the existing implementations can make

655
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,000
the necessary changes

656
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,720
so we certainly we we welcome the

657
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,399
reviews and especially in particular uh

658
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,480
the experience from uh from

659
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,919
implementators

660
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,520
and we also

661
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,159
we work with uh with our chairs

662
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,520
on the implementation report so folks if

663
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,840
you have an implementation please let

664
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,120
the chairs and all

665
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,919
shares add slash or the mailing list

666
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,600
know about your implementation in

667
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,559
particular which basically

668
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,960
which capabilities you support

669
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,240
right

670
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,600
and also i think uh last couple days

671
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,320
uh i think

672
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,279
there's a there's a one one more thing i

673
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,279
think we would like to do giving the

674
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,360
long history of this document and

675
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,039
especially the significant changes in

676
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,000
from version 4 to version 5. i think we

677
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,480
would like to add appendix

678
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,880
to the document to make it clear what

679
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,279
has changed or the evolution

680
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,000
of the draft that will he that will help

681
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,520
the implementation

682
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,399
uh

683
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,520
and also interoperability in the field

684
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,919
and that's i would think that's optional

685
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,600
that should be removed

686
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,880
uh you know before final publication

687
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
all right these are these i think these

688
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,840
are all the slides we have

689
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,200
cool thank you thank you anchor ac thank

690
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,440
you

691
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,679
you can hear me right ac lyndon cisco

692
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,840
system so so i agree that it shouldn't

693
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,960
be for you know it should only be for uh

694
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,720
capabilities it makes sense for but

695
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,039
you're that's not going to be specified

696
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,880
so what happens is if

697
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,200
people support this dynamic capabilities

698
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,799
but they don't support the same set of

699
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,000
capabilities the session just gets

700
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,200
reset if there's a mismatch right

701
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,720
no actually

702
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,799
operationally you'd have to document

703
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,240
what you uh

704
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,760
what you said no easy

705
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,320
let me let me reply ac it's actually

706
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,640
that's not the case you basically this

707
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,519
is this is by negotiation up front you

708
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,320
say okay i suppose let's say let's say

709
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,519
he says

710
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,559
let's say i say i support a and b

711
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,840
and uh

712
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,840
ac you say okay you support bi brc so in

713
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,240
the end we can only do b

714
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,360
we cannot do asc so you basically it's

715
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,919
controlled by both sides both sides have

716
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,480
agreed to support the particular

717
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,840
capability then the dynamic revision can

718
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,919
happen

719
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,880
okay so what happens

720
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,039
so what would happen is you you you

721
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,880
would attempt a dynamic renegotiation

722
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,440
and if if somebody supported a b and c

723
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,640
and then the other guy supported c

724
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,640
uh but the other guy didn't support c

725
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,200
dynamically it couldn't be renegotiated

726
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,320
because he doesn't support that

727
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,840
dynamically

728
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,159
so basically up front in the open

729
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,279
message

730
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,559
you have to list what you support

731
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,480
right that cannot change i'm talking

732
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,399
about the dynamics

733
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,840
dynamics

734
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,080
dynamic is the second step so in the

735
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,679
open message

736
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,399
once i say ask support dynamic revision

737
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,760
of abc

738
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,679
the other side they say i support

739
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,880
alarming revision of c now you can only

740
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,600
do c dynamic division of c because both

741
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,440
sides supports it

742
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,760
you can't okay okay okay i i didn't

743
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,440
re-read the draft i haven't read it for

744
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,519
a couple years thanks yeah so that that

745
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,000
is i think that is uh

746
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,279
remember

747
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,760
for folks who still follow follow the

748
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,039
draft originally it was too broad we

749
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,720
basically say oh i support dynamic

750
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,480
capability out that's very problematic

751
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,799
because it's it means

752
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,200
i think the thematic is not clear means

753
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,480
support one or two or all of them so

754
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,679
i think

755
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,399
before version four even we say okay now

756
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,880
you have to list what do you support

757
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,240
up front

758
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,880
right uh

759
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,640
so there's basically if you look at

760
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,600
protocol extension right why

761
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,279
it's a definition of the uh basically is

762
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,159
is you advertise your uh

763
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,640
the dynamic capability in the open you

764
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,039
list the capability you support then the

765
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,039
saving things that the message

766
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,039
dynamically will be messaged for

767
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,480
revisions

768
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,440
subsequently

769
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,919
cool thanks jeff

770
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,919
thanks so i think you've answered part

771
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,360
of the question which was how do we know

772
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,919
what's safe to change uh you're saying

773
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,679
the procedure has been limited to

774
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,080
only allow us to update things that we

775
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,960
have

776
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,600
uh originally exchanged

777
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
i still think there's probably edge

778
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,200
cases in that where

779
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,279
add paths as an example

780
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,000
that's not safe for you to renegotiate

781
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,960
so

782
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,280
it'd be nice if we had a way maybe a

783
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,879
parallel capability that said here are

784
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,560
the capabilities we allow to be

785
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,800
renegotiated

786
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,719
so take that piece as a standalone bit

787
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,719
of feedback but certainly having it is

788
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,399
renegotiate only the stuff that is

789
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,480
inside of the open message

790
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,639
simplifies procedures quite a bit versus

791
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,879
what was there some years ago

792
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,440
yeah that also gives the control to

793
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,280
actually to both sides

794
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,399
if work

795
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,918
so it's basically they are multiple

796
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,520
controllers why is the software

797
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,000
capability right your implementation

798
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,359
basically

799
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,839
we don't expect vendors to implement the

800
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,639
capability that does not make sense but

801
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,800
an angry revision all that involved too

802
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,960
much complexity that's one level of

803
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,159
control

804
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,918
if there's if the software does not have

805
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,599
a have the

806
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,480
does not have the the feature you cannot

807
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,960
use it right second thing is that it's

808
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,520
also operationally it's once the

809
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,440
software supports this

810
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,839
the revision of particular capability it

811
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,800
is the either side can decide

812
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,599
do you really want to enable it by

813
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,960
configuration right uh operationally so

814
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,079
it's so they are this

815
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,079
yeah

816
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,440
right so

817
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,720
again there may be situations where uh a

818
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,960
implementation a had negotiated a

819
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,880
feature with implementation b

820
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,720
you want to revise it but it may not be

821
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,280
safe and the session would drop knowing

822
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,800
if it's going to be something that could

823
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,079
cause the drop

824
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,720
if a knew that it would potentially

825
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,560
avoid trying to renegotiate and simply

826
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,640
bring it to operator tension anyway so

827
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,640
that's the feedback on the

828
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,520
procedure uh in terms of advancing the

829
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,640
draft

830
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,320
uh you're saying that there's multiple

831
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,920
implementations meaning you know greater

832
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,040
than one

833
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,720
if these are actually multiple

834
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,640
independent implementations we have a

835
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,599
lot of easier opportunity at iana to

836
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,960
move things forward in terms of early

837
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,320
allocation

838
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,680
so if you could

839
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,160
take the link that's in chat for the

840
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,440
wiki where we would like to get the

841
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,359
implementation report filed

842
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,440
this would let us do this very very

843
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,200
quickly

844
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,800
sure sure so it's clear i think the last

845
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,160
time uh srihari and were discussing this

846
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,640
we are not sure about the procedures

847
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,119
of doing the implementation report

848
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,280
so we will work with you with the chairs

849
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,280
with you on that

850
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,880
uh to see

851
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,720
so there are certainly there are some

852
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,760
implementations are public uh on they

853
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,400
basically is in their online

854
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,920
documentation

855
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,440
some it's not clear but

856
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,359
through the emails through the question

857
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,800
we know that there are other

858
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,720
implementations out there

859
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,760
okay that was my questions thank you

860
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,359
thank you thank you

861
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,440
hey nk one comment as a working group

862
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,560
member uh here k you could tell arkis um

863
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,359
the draft has been around for a while um

864
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,480
i am happy to see implementations

865
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,200
um you've talked about what capabilities

866
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
can be negotiated

867
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,800
and the

868
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,480
the kind of capabilities can be

869
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,320
negotiated is

870
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,119
uh

871
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,119
um upon

872
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,280
implementers and upon

873
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,920
operators to decide in the field

874
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,760
what would be cool is

875
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,480
if you can make a comment or two and you

876
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,079
can take this to working group as well

877
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,359
as what are the easiest use cases to

878
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,440
enable this draft for i think official

879
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,680
fees are are the low hanging fruits but

880
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,440
something like that to say hey you can

881
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,000
enable this and by the way the easiest

882
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,680
use case is when you want to enable a

883
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,920
new offi selfie something along that

884
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,680
lines i think

885
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,160
will also allow more implementers to

886
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,400
think about where the feature can be

887
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,760
enabled in a limited use yeah

888
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,160
yeah yeah actually if you look at the

889
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,599
version 16 right in the introduction we

890
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,839
also added text on gr

891
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,440
uh because

892
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,960
primarily these these two things

893
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,560
certainly make sense the the uh f is

894
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,640
plus and the gr

895
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,920
so if we yeah we can we can look at it

896
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,560
if you if you have a if you can offer

897
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,800
some text that will be cool too

898
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,480
so we will look at it

899
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
super thank you so much yeah

900
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,079
thank you any other questions for nk

901
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,520
thank you

902
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,640
next is uh

903
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,400
multi-session

904
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,560
for bgp or quick uh yingsen

905
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,480
uh hello everyone and this is india i'm

906
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,359
going to present use of streams in vcp

907
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,640
over quake

908
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,440
on behalf of the co-authors

909
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,400
next slide please

910
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,240
so first of all why do we need bcp

911
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,160
multi-sessions

912
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,720
most of today's bcp implementation

913
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,560
support only one tcp session

914
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,920
and all supported rfe services run in

915
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,400
this one connection

916
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,599
there was a draft uh ietf pcp

917
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,960
multi-session

918
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,280
several years back

919
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,680
proposed to support busy

920
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,839
pcp multi-sessions

921
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,720
as point out by the draft there are two

922
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,720
major issues

923
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,599
the first one is that most male formed

924
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,040
messages cause the tcp concession to be

925
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,800
terminated

926
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,960
well this might be necessary for

927
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,800
particle correctness

928
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,440
it is desirable that only our physique

929
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,720
with the male form was message to be

930
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,240
terminated

931
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,640
and leave all other sessions untouched

932
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,560
for example a male formed message or

933
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,760
even misconfiguration in flow spec

934
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,920
should not impact the regular

935
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,319
ipv4 or ipv6

936
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,280
address family

937
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,480
the second issue is that

938
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,400
since all these office services are

939
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,880
carried in one connection

940
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,240
and sbcp is extended to carry more and

941
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,520
more services there are more chances of

942
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,040
control plane resource contention

943
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,880
if we can separate all these services

944
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,480
it's easier to manage such contention

945
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,839
next slide please

946
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,160
so

947
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,280
quick

948
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,520
defined in rfc 9000 is a udp based

949
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,079
multiplexed and secure transport

950
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,119
protocol

951
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,839
so i'm not going to talk details about

952
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,240
quick just want to mention that quick

953
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,960
exchange information wear streams

954
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,520
a quick connection can carry multiple

955
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,000
streams

956
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,960
as shown in the picture here in a quick

957
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,319
package multiple streams can be

958
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,000
multiplexed inside into one packet

959
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,640
so each quick stream has its own flow

960
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,520
control as well as flow control for the

961
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,640
entire connection

962
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,598
next slide please

963
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,440
there was a draft presented at last atf

964
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,119
which defined the mechanism of using bcp

965
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,560
or of

966
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,520
of bcp or bcp or earthquake

967
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,240
so this draft builds on top of that

968
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,480
draft specify

969
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,319
how to use quick streams to establish

970
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,520
multiple bcp sessions

971
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,680
each vcp session operates independently

972
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,119
which means

973
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,720
if some

974
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,040
critical if there are some critical

975
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,760
condition happens in one session it

976
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,880
won't affect other sessions

977
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,680
so we have a picture here

978
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,480
on the slide trying to illustrate the

979
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,280
idea and the difference

980
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,000
most implementations today run all the

981
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,359
rfe service in one tcp connection

982
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,119
which means packets for different

983
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,000
network work layer services are carried

984
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,079
in one tcp connection

985
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,599
while in quick we can use one stream

986
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,319
for one office selfie

987
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,560
as shown in this picture

988
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,160
and it

989
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,520
works like you have multiple small parts

990
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,880
inside one big pipe

991
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,680
next slide please

992
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,599
ying zhan i'm sorry to

993
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,640
interrupt uh linda has a question i just

994
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,680
want to ask linda are you okay to wait

995
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,200
um till

996
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,040
uh

997
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,800
i just have a very good question for

998
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,880
clarification so are you talking about

999
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,119
multiple stations between saying you

1000
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,440
know

1001
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,839
multiple pcp sessions between yeah we

1002
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:28,000
don't appear

1003
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,760
oh okay

1004
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,839
why

1005
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,119
all right sorry you can go on

1006
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,720
yeah maybe you can ask the follow-up

1007
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,200
questions a question or questions after

1008
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,800
the presentation is done that would be

1009
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,079
perfect

1010
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,280
thank you

1011
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,920
thank you linda

1012
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,240
next slide please

1013
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,280
so here are some details

1014
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,400
the bcp multi-stream capability is

1015
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,839
defined to indicate that a bcp speaker

1016
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,040
can support multi-sessions

1017
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,760
once the bcp session is established it

1018
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,839
follows the regular procedure as

1019
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,760
specified in

1020
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,000
rfc 72

1021
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,160
4271

1022
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,359
so the

1023
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,839
we have a figure here just it's a

1024
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,599
snapshot of the encoding of this

1025
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,000
msc

1026
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,480
next slide please

1027
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,359
the user interface for page flip is too

1028
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,800
close to the close button

1029
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,160
yep that's what happened sorry for that

1030
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,720
no problem

1031
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,598
next slide please

1032
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,400
so error handling um this draft

1033
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,200
introduces a few new error sub code in

1034
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,880
open messages

1035
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,520
about uh multi-session conflict session

1036
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,760
capability mismatch

1037
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,440
network layer protocol mismatch so um

1038
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,319
i'm now going to read the slide you know

1039
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,880
if you want to know the details please

1040
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,839
read the draft

1041
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,799
next slide please

1042
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,359
so collision avoidance

1043
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,640
before creating a new session a bcp

1044
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,720
speaker should check that no session

1045
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,880
exists for the same network layer

1046
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,839
protocol if a session already exists the

1047
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,480
bcp speaker should not

1048
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,160
attempt to create a new one

1049
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,720
in case of a collision happens

1050
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,359
it's result using the extension

1051
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,359
specified in rfc

1052
00:45:56,359 --> 00:45:58,240
6286

1053
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,920
and please refer to the draft of details

1054
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,560
it's sort of long so

1055
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,359
um

1056
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:09,119
next slide slide please

1057
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,359
and next step

1058
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,359
we are going to

1059
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,480
continue to refine the draft and review

1060
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,960
and comments are welcome collaborators

1061
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,599
are welcome

1062
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,440
and that's it's it

1063
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,640
cool thank you ying zhen sorry you linda

1064
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,400
linda do you want to go first there are

1065
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,280
a bunch of questions on the chat as well

1066
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,359
so i'm curious about this multiple

1067
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,800
sessions right you mentioned ipv4 ipv6

1068
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,640
um so i always thought the bgp over tcp

1069
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,640
the tcp session just maintained that

1070
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,800
they can have retransmission

1071
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,040
in case some packets get lost

1072
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,520
and in terms of indicating different

1073
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,480
capability or different

1074
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,880
the the prefix whatever is already

1075
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,920
reflected by the ipsavi so one bgp

1076
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,880
speaker can advertise multiple updates

1077
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,480
with different ipc base um so indicate

1078
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,760
different things

1079
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,560
so why you need the different sections

1080
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,040
to me it's practically achieve the

1081
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,119
different purpose of different packets

1082
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,599
already

1083
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,359
so as

1084
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,880
there is a one slide

1085
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,520
okay okay i'll try to go back to slide i

1086
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,880
think number three maybe

1087
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,800
number three or number three yeah so

1088
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,200
uh there is the the one that i has

1089
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,720
so like you have all office offices that

1090
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,280
are carried in one tcp session right so

1091
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,400
something wrong in one office traffic

1092
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,079
will cause the entire tcp session to

1093
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,680
reset

1094
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,599
what do you mean the major

1095
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,839
what would it mean wrong

1096
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,240
mean package lost

1097
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,160
now packet get lost

1098
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,440
there are

1099
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,280
different error conditions that's

1100
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,440
defined by the protocol you know for

1101
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,280
different address family there might be

1102
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,280
different error conditions all those

1103
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,359
error codes a lot of them will cause

1104
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:14,400
session to reset

1105
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,200
so

1106
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,760
just like the example i used you have

1107
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,760
something wrong in

1108
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,880
um

1109
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,319
flow spec

1110
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,400
that will cause your

1111
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,960
entire tcp session to be terminated

1112
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,880
so so that's really up to the

1113
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,960
implementer right implementation i think

1114
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,839
router a may reset the bt session

1115
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,480
it's defined in the protocol

1116
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,240
you have to reset the session

1117
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,559
okay i'm sure there'll be reasons why

1118
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,800
you need to reset so the sum of the same

1119
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,359
reasons can cause your session to be

1120
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,760
reset as well does it

1121
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,400
i'm just curious on that

1122
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,480
yeah these are these are great questions

1123
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,640
uh we should take it on the working list

1124
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,960
and interest of times but i think uh

1125
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,440
linda yingsen is talking about is if

1126
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,200
there are errors which are specific to

1127
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,559
address family

1128
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,160
that will cause the entire session to

1129
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,040
reset and affect other address families

1130
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,760
right yeah

1131
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,119
thank you

1132
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,400
thank you um andrew

1133
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,200
um can you guys hear me okay

1134
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,160
um

1135
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,079
yes i can hear you

1136
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,800
my question here would be if we've got a

1137
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,599
problem with the session resets as you

1138
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,040
say

1139
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,280
would this not be better served by a

1140
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,839
simple modification

1141
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:44,559
or pgp itself to allow fe south resets

1142
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:47,280
rather than the entire session reset

1143
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,000
rather than kind of reinventing the

1144
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,480
whole underlay 2pgp in this manner

1145
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,880
yeah so i think that's that was the

1146
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,960
point of the um vcp multi-session draft

1147
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,599
right what it was trying to do is to

1148
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:09,359
support um bcp multi-session or tcp

1149
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,440
right so

1150
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,079
you you something wrong in one office

1151
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,640
office you don't want to reset the whole

1152
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,400
connection that costs all the ipv4 ipv6

1153
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,160
whatever character out reset

1154
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,440
so the the

1155
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,200
the pro the

1156
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,599
difficult part with that draft is

1157
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,359
because you have to use tcp and then you

1158
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:41,359
need to have multiple tcps connections

1159
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:43,839
now like what we are proposing here you

1160
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,480
only have one quick connection and you

1161
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,160
can use multiple you can use streams to

1162
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,599
support

1163
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,520
rf stuffy so you can have this vertical

1164
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,440
pipes

1165
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,520
hope i explain that clearly

1166
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,800
did i answer your question

1167
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,319
thank you okay

1168
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:15,760
uh yeah

1169
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,440
can you hear me

1170
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,640
yes

1171
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,760
okay so uh just to clarify clarify on

1172
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,440
the error handling

1173
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,520
so if you look at multi-protocol

1174
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,079
extensions it basically

1175
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,319
sort of generically

1176
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,800
so amazing that if this error is

1177
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,960
associated with a particular address

1178
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,160
family

1179
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,160
basically this address family can be

1180
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,440
disabled

1181
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,280
but

1182
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,119
then the um the

1183
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,760
error handling spec

1184
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,920
they should carry that forward

1185
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,640
basically that's why and one of them

1186
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,480
basically

1187
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,280
actions uh you know shorter for station

1188
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,760
reset you basically disable that but

1189
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,880
that has not been really spelled out

1190
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,680
completely and has not been another

1191
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,559
aware of the implementations actually

1192
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,119
doing that but i'm just thinking that

1193
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:10,800
because we have that

1194
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,599
uh spec for error handling to disable

1195
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,599
particular address department coupled

1196
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,160
with the dynamic capability that

1197
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,839
actually can be achieved now

1198
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,880
dynamic capability for address family

1199
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,440
to enable or disable let's say in case

1200
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,119
of whatever that's associated with a

1201
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,119
particular address family then you

1202
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:33,280
basically you disable that temporarily

1203
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,640
later if you can also enable it

1204
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,640
that part was missing without dynamic

1205
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,160
capability how do you actually

1206
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,839
re-enable a particular address

1207
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:47,839
yeah

1208
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:51,200
certainly i agree it's not as clean i

1209
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,920
think as you have a completely separate

1210
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,960
you know sort of frustration concept

1211
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,440
yeah thank you for the clarification i

1212
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,640
didn't know that you you refresh the

1213
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,440
dynamic capability draft so that has

1214
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,359
actually a big impact

1215
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,400
uh for us um i will look into the

1216
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,839
details of your draft

1217
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:16,559
and see whether what what the impact it

1218
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,480
may have and

1219
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,200
we can talk also look at this look at

1220
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,280
the error handling spec

1221
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,200
because this is one of the

1222
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,319
actions basically short of station reset

1223
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,359
yeah so once once we support

1224
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:34,000
yeah i i agree with you once we support

1225
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
dynamic uh capability a lot of the cases

1226
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,880
we may that may not cause the session to

1227
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,119
reset right so you add a new address

1228
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,240
family

1229
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,559
configure new office safety that sort of

1230
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:47,839
thing

1231
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:52,240
yeah that's a actually a big improvement

1232
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,119
thank you

1233
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,800
thank you thank you jeff

1234
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,200
yeah just to add a detail here one of

1235
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,839
the problems that the

1236
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,599
error handling draft was attempting the

1237
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,079
deal with is that when nlri in

1238
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,839
particular are mal

1239
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:12,079
we sort of lose where you know the

1240
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:13,920
packet boundaries can be since this is

1241
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,839
all in a tsp stream

1242
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,839
it's my belief i need to finish

1243
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,760
reviewing the quick specs that quick

1244
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,280
provides a proper layer 5 style session

1245
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,440
and if that's the case

1246
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,040
this means we have some additional

1247
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,920
alternatives about how bgp can handle

1248
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,839
some of these error conditions

1249
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,520
so places where we had to reset the

1250
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,440
session because we couldn't trust the

1251
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,960
packet boundaries

1252
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,480
potentially go away

1253
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,319
it still doesn't handle our issues with

1254
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,480
no form dental right not letting us know

1255
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,680
what the

1256
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,000
actual prefixes are but it moves us from

1257
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,839
having to reset the session immediately

1258
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:48,720
to

1259
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,400
moving to potentially not trusting the

1260
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,480
session

1261
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,640
yeah thank you for that point that's

1262
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,040
exactly what we are trying one of the

1263
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,960
reasons we are trying what we are trying

1264
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,160
to do here

1265
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,720
right so

1266
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,440
you have a malformed message in one

1267
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,920
particular office office we want to

1268
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,119
leave just you know reset that session

1269
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:16,040
instead of the whole entire connection

1270
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,160
any more questions

1271
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,200
i see there are a lot of comments in the

1272
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,680
chat window i will try to catch up those

1273
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,799
comments

1274
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:38,160
and we will communicate more on the list

1275
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,359
thank you

1276
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,240
thank you yinzhen

1277
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,480
next up is linda

1278
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,960
with 5gh computing

1279
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,920
okay

1280
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,079
and um

1281
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,000
okay so this is the update to the

1282
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,599
um

1283
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:00,559
bgp update to reflect the fight edge

1284
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:04,400
computing service related metadata

1285
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,520
next slide please

1286
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:12,319
okay so just to recap

1287
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,319
so in the

1288
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,440
5g edge computing environment for low

1289
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,240
latency services they may put many

1290
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,359
servers

1291
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,520
in close proximity

1292
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,160
to serve the same application

1293
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,920
and

1294
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,520
i know that still there are people

1295
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,480
debating

1296
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,599
um that those kind of

1297
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,280
choosing the right

1298
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,000
server should be application layer

1299
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,960
function

1300
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,520
it is true that is all done today

1301
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,480
and so for the application layer to

1302
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,680
choose the

1303
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,119
appropriate server they normally use

1304
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,559
local dns

1305
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,880
so practically making the local dns

1306
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,559
being the

1307
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,160
finger one managing the traffic

1308
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,440
condition basically based on their load

1309
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,079
and they can give different

1310
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:05,599
address to the english router and so the

1311
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:06,960
english router

1312
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,359
resolve the new ip address it will go to

1313
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,040
the new server

1314
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,839
however this kind of approach using the

1315
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:16,480
local dns as a traffic manager it

1316
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,640
doesn't take into consideration the

1317
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,119
actual uh traffic condition in the

1318
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:22,720
network

1319
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,920
as you can see that all those routers in

1320
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,559
there they may experience stress

1321
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:31,520
or they may experience experience um

1322
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,319
actual load so this

1323
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,920
job is to bring some of those attributes

1324
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,640
to be propagated to the ingress router

1325
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,680
so that they can um build appropriate

1326
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:48,000
tunnel to the specific equestrian so um

1327
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,079
here's the an

1328
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,960
assumption for this draft

1329
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,000
we're talking about small iq network

1330
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,880
close to the 5g

1331
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,760
core

1332
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,880
and

1333
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,960
the services which need those low

1334
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,000
latency services are limited

1335
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,839
just like today in like aws women's

1336
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,400
weave lens zoom you have to register

1337
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,680
your service in order to receive the low

1338
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,000
latency service so we're talking about

1339
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,839
limited number of

1340
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:21,040
addresses

1341
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,000
so with um

1342
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,280
anycast address like say for example s1

1343
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,400
here

1344
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,319
being attached to

1345
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:33,440
uh four different egress routers if they

1346
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,400
are assigned as the same address to the

1347
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,000
english router they are just saying

1348
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,160
multiple next half to reach that same

1349
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,160
destination and we want to

1350
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,440
be able to advertise the associate cost

1351
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,280
for this s1

1352
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,520
like associated to different egress

1353
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,760
router to the ingress one so they can

1354
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,520
compute the right path

1355
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,559
um

1356
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,680
next page please

1357
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,640
so we made some major changes um to

1358
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,400
simplify the attachment

1359
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,280
so

1360
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,000
the site cost is now is associated with

1361
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,720
the tunneling cap so basically for the

1362
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,520
e-waste router to announce a particular

1363
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,799
prefix

1364
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:18,880
can be carried by certain type of

1365
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,200
tunnels it can also

1366
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,280
attach the additional

1367
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,640
cost to reach this prefix so that for

1368
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,880
the ingress router they can compute that

1369
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,920
okay to reach specific prefix i can use

1370
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,520
this specific tunnel and um

1371
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,760
and this tunnel has this cost

1372
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,599
of course we have some assumption there

1373
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:40,480
that

1374
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,200
the matrix change the frequency of the

1375
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,400
changing of the matrix has to be large

1376
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,240
enough to not cause too much

1377
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,040
oscillation in changing the tunnel

1378
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,760
selection for the ingress router

1379
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,640
in the

1380
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,280
nano talk a couple of nanos

1381
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,960
ago there was a

1382
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,400
talk about

1383
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,480
how they um in the

1384
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,200
in the wireless domain how do they uh

1385
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,480
manage the any kind of servers actually

1386
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,640
there's some issue they're talking about

1387
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,280
when traffic pattern change it takes

1388
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,559
months for them to install new servers

1389
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,520
in in new locations like for example

1390
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,760
there's a talk about

1391
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,559
before pandemic there used to be traffic

1392
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:27,520
mainly

1393
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,760
centralized in certain locations but

1394
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,040
during pandemic is shifted to different

1395
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,400
different

1396
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,839
locations

1397
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:38,480
limiting data centers so here if we can

1398
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,119
change the timer to be in matter of

1399
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,920
hours or days then we can help the

1400
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,160
applications um

1401
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,359
to be better balanced utilize our

1402
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:50,880
network condition

1403
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,839
uh so um so basically here some of the

1404
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:58,799
we propose that can be attached to the

1405
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,640
tunnel in cap

1406
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,960
path attributes

1407
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,760
okay

1408
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,040
next slide please

1409
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,480
so another thing is um

1410
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,640
since the number of those services are

1411
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:16,000
very limited um not every router is

1412
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,119
interested

1413
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:18,960
in

1414
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,799
in those services so um we can use the

1415
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:25,599
route constraint distribution so that

1416
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,240
those those attributes uh those metrics

1417
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,359
are not flooded to to everywhere

1418
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:33,280
especially for example like you can have

1419
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,520
a table like based on application server

1420
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,160
id um

1421
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,640
indicating which what kind of ingress

1422
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,040
routers might be interested for this

1423
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,680
kind of service

1424
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,558
okay next one

1425
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,920
okay so we this is just um i think

1426
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,039
second time we presented here

1427
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,680
we want to get more feedback

1428
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,039
and

1429
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:02,839
okay that's it

1430
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,559
questions

1431
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,960
jeffrey

1432
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,359
thank you linda um

1433
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,039
not sure if my voice is edible but

1434
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,920
jeffrey do you want to go

1435
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,200
jeffrey you are in the queue

1436
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,480
we can't hear you if you're talking

1437
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,000
about now

1438
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,520
much better thank you okay um so earlier

1439
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:47,359
i sent the email to lsr and idr and six

1440
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:48,960
men list uh

1441
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,280
talking about uh

1442
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,839
basically referring to a

1443
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:57,039
discussion from uh in the spring time

1444
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,119
about the use case

1445
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:01,280
there there are actually two two

1446
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,200
problems

1447
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,079
to solve in this use case one is how to

1448
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:08,720
uh pick which server to use

1449
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,559
another one is uh

1450
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,520
how do you stick to the same server when

1451
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,440
when mobile devices move to a different

1452
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,760
anchoring upf

1453
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,440
the second problem is actually harder to

1454
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,359
solve and the long email discussion in

1455
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:25,279
the six-man list in springtime

1456
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,079
explains some different complexities

1457
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:28,960
there

1458
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,440
so based on all that i believe and

1459
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,079
actually many uh according to that linda

1460
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,200
agrees as well that the best

1461
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,440
solution to the problem is actually uh

1462
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,839
at the application layer just use the

1463
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:44,720
app server app load balancer

1464
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,680
to pick which server to use and to to

1465
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,079
make sure the traffic sticks to the same

1466
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:50,799
uh

1467
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:53,440
same server when the ue moves

1468
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,240
so just want to bring mention that there

1469
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:59,520
is an email thread about this thank you

1470
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,079
yes thank you and i agree with you many

1471
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,400
people working in cloud provider like my

1472
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,720
sister included she worked for aws lo

1473
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,880
player four load balancer she debate

1474
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,359
with me all the time

1475
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:13,599
basically from their perspective that

1476
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,920
network doesn't need to do anything um

1477
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,440
application layer can take over

1478
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,520
everything uh however they their

1479
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,400
approach have their limitations as well

1480
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,640
they can instantiate a load balancer

1481
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,400
very quickly

1482
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,640
however the load balancer they

1483
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,599
instantiate is at their specific

1484
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:34,880
location um for example

1485
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:38,079
when they deploy those woodlands boom in

1486
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:40,319
service like verizon's

1487
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:43,520
edge data centers now like aws has

1488
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,000
reblend zone instantiating

1489
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,079
verizon's

1490
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:49,680
local

1491
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,280
because

1492
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,720
access point the data center says i've

1493
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,200
saved or says um

1494
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:01,760
anyway they cannot really add a server a

1495
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,680
load balancer that easily it takes

1496
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,079
months for them to be able to add a new

1497
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:08,559
server there so um

1498
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:11,280
they can do a lot of things but i think

1499
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,000
networking since we are the underlay a

1500
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,640
provider and we

1501
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,839
have a lot of lots of information that

1502
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:21,200
can help them

1503
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,799
make their service better balanced

1504
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,480
it's not that everybody's going to take

1505
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,119
this approach but by having an approach

1506
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:31,680
there on the table eventually they will

1507
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,839
see that hey actually this is better

1508
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:36,559
than what we have done so that's why we

1509
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,119
propose this approach

1510
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,720
right right but the thing is that uh

1511
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,880
solving the which server to pick

1512
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,520
initially is just

1513
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,880
a small part of the the solution and and

1514
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,960
when you when the ue moves how do you

1515
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,280
make sure you stick to the same server

1516
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,200
and that's a that's a more complicated

1517
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,880
problem that's that's why i i

1518
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,880
when you consider all those problems to

1519
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:03,760
solve

1520
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,720
you may still agree that you may agree

1521
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,680
that

1522
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,839
the best solution is still at the uh

1523
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:14,000
soviet uh at the application layer

1524
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,599
okay so

1525
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:18,079
that's in a six month discussion and we

1526
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,319
can continue there because we didn't get

1527
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:22,400
a chance to present there um for the

1528
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,960
solution how do we do the sticky service

1529
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,680
for the sticky service and especially in

1530
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,559
a 5d environment when ue moves the

1531
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:33,440
source address don't move okay and also

1532
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,240
the flow id don't move so based on those

1533
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,960
information especially bgp they can

1534
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,920
count it into the same tunnel to go to

1535
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:42,720
the

1536
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:47,280
previous um egress router um that is not

1537
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,160
part

1538
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,319
actually today's router modern router

1539
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:53,119
can support that feature um it's

1540
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:55,440
almost like traffic engineering when you

1541
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,160
have bandwidth change when you have

1542
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,280
pass condition change and how do you

1543
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,680
swing from one pass to another past the

1544
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,400
cause changes right it's same problem

1545
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,520
same solution we have done that

1546
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,760
for many years

1547
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,599
yeah i actually have a question but we

1548
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,920
can take it offline about the

1549
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,799
ue address change i i have

1550
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:19,839
i have some

1551
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:22,960
doubt there but we can take it off

1552
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,520
okay thank you

1553
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:30,720
thank you i've got a quick quick

1554
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,079
question for you as a working group

1555
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:34,240
member linda this is george um from

1556
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,119
marcus uh that can you comment on the

1557
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,400
chattiness

1558
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,799
that this would bring in or you think

1559
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:43,760
this won't make uh bgp any more chatty

1560
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,480
than what it is

1561
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,400
it shouldn't as long as we put the

1562
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,240
timing there it's not like every minute

1563
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,480
you change we're talking about hours or

1564
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,240
days the frequency granularity so um i

1565
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,760
think we're going to modify the drag and

1566
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,920
reflect that we're not making we have to

1567
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:03,599
set a timer for the matrix change

1568
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:06,480
okay super thank you linda

1569
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,720
thank you

1570
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,839
next we have is hypo for revised error

1571
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:29,439
handling for bgp messages

1572
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,158
oh everyone can hear me

1573
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:34,319
yes we can hear you

1574
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:35,600
okay

1575
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,520
hello this is hypoall

1576
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,040
from huawei

1577
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,600
our topic is about revised error

1578
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,439
handling for php messages

1579
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:48,318
next slide please

1580
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,600
here is a simple general for bpi

1581
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,600
handling

1582
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,399
suppose there are three routers

1583
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:59,198
router 1 to rotor3 they are connected to

1584
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:01,600
the r yeah then the

1585
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,960
r3 may

1586
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,080
update some messages to the r when the r

1587
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,719
found that the package has an error the

1588
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:11,839
army will reset the connection later the

1589
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:14,960
session will be established then the r3

1590
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,600
will continue to advertise the message

1591
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,759
the session will go down and up again

1592
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:22,880
and again this may occur for each each

1593
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,359
session such a procedure

1594
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:28,399
don't have to solve the problem what is

1595
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:30,479
the occurred perhaps authority may have

1596
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:33,759
some software box or

1597
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:36,080
understanding of standards we have which

1598
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,040
i will also have met this uh center role

1599
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,120
in some interconnection with the other

1600
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,719
vendors yeah

1601
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:47,319
this procedure is defined in rc for to

1602
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:51,359
4271 but it but it's too strict and also

1603
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,439
it was revised by

1604
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,440
fc7606

1605
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,800
but there are still some not clearly

1606
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,840
description of the

1607
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,640
situation

1608
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,520
next slide please

1609
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:10,239
this is our proposal our proposal is you

1610
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,880
to reduce the impact of these errors on

1611
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,120
bp existing services

1612
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,000
as this

1613
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,640
as this current kind of residual doesn't

1614
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,520
help to solve the problem

1615
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,000
we want to decline some general where

1616
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,159
the current definition is not clear

1617
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:28,840
enough and some are too

1618
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,040
strict uh the following

1619
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,360
is uh something about the suggestions

1620
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,159
first about the mp rich and mp outreach

1621
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:39,360
yeah uh there are some uh some there are

1622
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,760
three kind of sub sub center rules the

1623
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,719
fourth is the prefix last error

1624
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:47,679
now in current uh procedure when we find

1625
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:50,000
proof's last error we also may

1626
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,840
may this uh re we also may uh

1627
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,480
reset the session so we recommended that

1628
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,440
we may discard the error prefix and stop

1629
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:02,239
the current messages passing but we also

1630
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:04,880
may keep the correct correct prefix

1631
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,320
passed before

1632
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,880
the second is that when some when the

1633
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,239
when the message

1634
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:13,120
there appears more than one amp reach on

1635
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:16,960
npr which measures attributes we in this

1636
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,960
in this general we recommended that we

1637
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,520
may process with the last

1638
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,239
last one or the first one and ignore the

1639
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:25,760
others

1640
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,560
the third is that the netherlands error

1641
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,640
also for this scenario we recommended

1642
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:34,560
that we may ignore current message

1643
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,360
the second is about the validation of

1644
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,640
the address

1645
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,600
there are two sub-center rules the first

1646
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,960
result the address is indicate the pgp

1647
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,560
bpsid

1648
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,679
uh the rfc

1649
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:52,239
6286 the differently defined the bpid

1650
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:54,640
only choose only uh

1651
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,880
on unintended

1652
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,320
online integer only zero is invalid the

1653
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,080
other all the other values

1654
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,280
is a valid vpid

1655
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,280
then there are some attributes such as

1656
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,719
aggregator s4 aggregator oriented id and

1657
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:13,280
the catalyst disease attributes are all

1658
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,640
used the

1659
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,080
number as a bpid so we may think we need

1660
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,679
if we may clearly

1661
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:22,560
define that only the zero value is

1662
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:27,040
invalid all the others are in are valid

1663
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,040
another is that address indeed in this

1664
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,120
indicates the ip

1665
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:34,000
mainly uses the network attribute

1666
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,560
in most case you can assume that valid

1667
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,679
unit cost address can be used so the

1668
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,880
money costs address reserve address and

1669
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,360
and the broadcast address and also and

1670
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,080
some invalid address shouldn't be used

1671
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,719
also there are some special address such

1672
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:53,520
as all the arrow also we may also we

1673
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,400
should we shouldn't use this either but

1674
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,560
but also there are perhaps made some

1675
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,440
other special address such as a

1676
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:04,560
localhost address this is a well whether

1677
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,800
we should use it or not this is a

1678
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,679
service behavior so we may not uh focus

1679
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:12,320
on it in here

1680
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,800
the third is that about the precedence

1681
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,440
built this was introduced uh from the

1682
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,920
rfc 8669

1683
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,040
this was defined to create a

1684
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,880
sr tunnel bps our tunnel

1685
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,000
when we saw in so in so when we find the

1686
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,800
attribute is incorrect it means that we

1687
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,840
can't use later to create as a tunnel so

1688
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,960
we may perhaps we may withdraw the roads

1689
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,480
because it's

1690
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,960
for otherwise it may cause some

1691
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,800
unexpected

1692
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,560
result

1693
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,520
next slide please

1694
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,239
uh also before this meeting we have

1695
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:57,040
received some comments uh since first of

1696
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,600
thanks for the robot's comments he gave

1697
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,440
us many comments

1698
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,360
some comments that we have been

1699
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,000
described in a previous decision

1700
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,239
uh there are also some general comments

1701
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,719
for discussion the first one is whether

1702
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:13,760
we when we see you issued

1703
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:14,880
i've seen

1704
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,480
76 or six piece or separate dropped we

1705
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,560
think that we may first discard which

1706
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,239
problem channel roles need to be

1707
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:24,320
modified and

1708
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,120
then we may uh discuss about whether to

1709
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:31,120
do to you do a beast or a new draft

1710
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,840
yeah the second comment is that bg4

1711
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,640
protocol running rtp is not a bullet

1712
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,880
proof when it comes to handling bad

1713
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,760
implementation or malicious protocol

1714
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,400
attacks consider using new transport

1715
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:48,159
which no longer runs on tcp and

1716
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:49,840
essentially

1717
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,159
not only treats all surface as a fully

1718
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,800
independent stream but also cause

1719
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,440
independent interdependency between the

1720
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,880
ornamental eye even with given selfie

1721
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,719
which also we may suggest that we

1722
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:05,520
firstly we may consider polishing the

1723
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,280
existing bpm

1724
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,239
mechanism and also then we may also

1725
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,080
consider improving the bp protocol

1726
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,719
mechanism because some nouns there are

1727
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,360
some jobs such as

1728
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,320
engine has shown before the pvp mass

1729
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,520
stream or euro creek also on some rfc

1730
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,920
like vp money session

1731
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,159
so we may also we will consider that but

1732
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:29,920
let me firstly

1733
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,560
consider publishing the existing vp they

1734
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,280
cannot be calling them

1735
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,840
next i please

1736
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,920
yeah okay we are welcome we may we all

1737
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,640
also welcome more comments and final

1738
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,960
discussion i also i just see that this

1739
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,440
afternoon i have received a new some

1740
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,320
comments from anchor yeah but we don't

1741
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,840
have time to

1742
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,000
reply for it

1743
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,400
thank you

1744
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:05,320
thank you thank you

1745
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:10,320
thank you so much uh not sure if i'm

1746
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,239
audible but nk can you hear me you can

1747
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,959
go first

1748
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,400
you can hear you care

1749
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,320
thank you we can't hear you yeah caillou

1750
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,760
can you now yes

1751
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,199
yeah yeah okay

1752
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:26,880
could you go back to

1753
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,800
the slides at least

1754
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,159
the several

1755
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:34,199
that itemize the issues

1756
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,360
yeah this one yeah this one okay

1757
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,760
so i i reply on the

1758
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,199
main list i think mostly i agree with

1759
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:45,679
with the robert's comments but

1760
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:48,080
i think i have several more specific

1761
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,239
comments why is this

1762
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:53,520
regarding this um an error iii

1763
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,560
basically uh passing if there's any

1764
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,360
error if you look at

1765
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,560
ifc

1766
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,040
the base best spec

1767
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:05,360
4271 basically there's a semantics

1768
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:08,560
validation right so basically this this

1769
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,480
and i have passing if you have whatever

1770
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:11,600
this will be

1771
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,679
basically the same it belongs to that

1772
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:17,920
category semantics thematic validation

1773
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,320
and the fundamental to this in highest

1774
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:23,280
error handling it's basically

1775
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:26,000
previously yeah as you correctly stated

1776
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,760
the best backstage you say if there's

1777
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,920
earlier error with the prefix you reset

1778
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:30,960
station

1779
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,800
so in this

1780
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,120
in the enhanced error handling what we

1781
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,520
stated that basically in some cases you

1782
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,800
can use

1783
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,199
tree that withdraw so you keep the good

1784
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:44,400
guys and throw out the bad guys right

1785
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,640
uh yeah the fundamental to this

1786
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,960
supremacist is basically you will be

1787
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:53,040
able to pass all the prefix in the air

1788
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,400
field or in this mp resource unreached

1789
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,880
an error field all of them

1790
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,000
that's the fundamental to that enhanced

1791
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,440
uh enhanced error handling draft and

1792
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,920
particular in particular to the tree

1793
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,520
that withdrawal because if you you as we

1794
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,960
all know pdp update is incremental every

1795
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,080
time you discard or it knows

1796
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,960
a message as you have here or ignore

1797
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,320
part of the message now you you may have

1798
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:27,280
a stale

1799
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,360
steroids because it's incremental

1800
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,719
between it will not be advertised to you

1801
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:35,360
for a long long time right so this is

1802
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,199
that's fundamental i think what you are

1803
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:39,920
proposing here this is not this is not

1804
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:40,960
correct

1805
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,719
the moment you do this you say okay i

1806
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:45,520
keep the prefix that passed previously

1807
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,280
that's good but

1808
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:50,000
what may whether what

1809
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,199
that

1810
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:53,520
all the prefix that following that you

1811
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,320
have not passed correctly that will

1812
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,239
become still let's say these are

1813
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:00,239
replacement or

1814
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:02,560
they are not reflected now it's

1815
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:03,920
basically the

1816
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:04,880
is

1817
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,600
at that point bdp will not behave

1818
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,920
correctly so this is this is i think

1819
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,920
fundamentally this problem i have a

1820
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,320
problem with relaxing

1821
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,040
the the error handling for the prefix

1822
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,239
schematics

1823
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:19,840
validation

1824
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,960
and in terms of this that's number one

1825
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,400
in terms of

1826
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:28,000
uh the pdp id in the aggregate or es4

1827
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,840
aggregate

1828
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,880
or the original id i think at that time

1829
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,040
we discussed so we talked about that we

1830
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,840
feel that it's sort of it's unnecessary

1831
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,280
for us to so to make it more restrictive

1832
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,159
if you look at aggregate yes aggregate

1833
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:46,159
we didn't specify that okay theory is

1834
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:48,960
invalid it doesn't really matter right

1835
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,440
and also the original idea

1836
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:54,320
if it's zero yeah that's a bug but

1837
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,040
it's a how much harm does it cost if you

1838
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,960
treat every through an hour suddenly you

1839
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,600
are you are you are losing reachability

1840
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,560
right so the cost least actually

1841
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,960
i went back and look at uh

1842
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,480
reflecting spec we didn't specify zero

1843
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:13,440
is invalid so we we can at this stage we

1844
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,239
cannot just we cannot do it right

1845
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:19,440
i think the only thing from from this

1846
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,159
proposal is really the next half next

1847
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:25,199
hub could be interesting it could be if

1848
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:27,760
necessary i think there's room for

1849
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,040
improvement

1850
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,800
because the way

1851
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,760
we we have uh are personally run into

1852
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,320
multiple cases of next half issues for

1853
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,560
example there's a misconfiguration of

1854
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,199
interface addresses you have a duplicate

1855
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:41,920
but

1856
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,639
as a base spec specifies

1857
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:47,440
you have to you have to drop that update

1858
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,440
if the next halfway contains your

1859
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:52,239
address that's you cannot even recover

1860
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:54,080
uh i mean in the old days you have to

1861
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,280
reset

1862
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,520
right so that's certainly that can be

1863
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,800
improved

1864
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,920
right uh so that's that's i think that

1865
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,719
i think if if working group agrees that

1866
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:07,120
should be i think as a separated

1867
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,320
document

1868
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:11,600
just focus on the next half validation

1869
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,400
right you can prefix srd if

1870
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,040
this these i'm not expert uh

1871
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,920
in that area if there's an error that is

1872
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,159
certainly that that's back

1873
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:25,280
was published after you passed

1874
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:29,280
error handling spec and as expected this

1875
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,880
should that draft

1876
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,800
should should do the proper error

1877
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,440
handling spec specification if there's

1878
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:39,120
error there then the authors of that

1879
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,239
that

1880
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:44,719
ifc should issue a peace uh

1881
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:45,600
uh

1882
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,400
revision that's following

1883
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,880
in the tradition right that's

1884
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,159
that's what i

1885
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:54,719
that's all the comments i think is uh

1886
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:58,000
it's uh the email has more details so so

1887
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,560
in summary i think that there's perhaps

1888
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,440
some benefit to basically to to have a

1889
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:07,600
targeted more focused uh you know draft

1890
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,880
perhaps on this next half

1891
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,360
attribute

1892
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:17,120
yeah thank you and thank you anchor yeah

1893
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,760
i see you you have too many

1894
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,800
comments and also i see i just see your

1895
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,880
email but uh i think

1896
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,760
i think we may first adjust some a

1897
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,920
little discussion about this for the

1898
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,920
first about the amp reach

1899
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:40,080
uh foreign see that uh when

1900
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,719
when we found the prefix error also we

1901
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:45,920
may keep the correct prefix

1902
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,239
this is because this in this behavior

1903
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:51,120
was we just think past women to our best

1904
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:55,199
effort to process each but also

1905
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:58,480
also it because for some address some

1906
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,880
surface the one

1907
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:04,159
one message one update plan may have

1908
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:05,280
some

1909
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,639
multiple

1910
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:09,280
multiple prototypes such as evpn they

1911
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,320
may have they may have

1912
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,159
they may have too many

1913
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:17,679
many kinds of row types when some rows

1914
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:19,520
once one and

1915
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:22,080
when some rules are updated or packaged

1916
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,639
in one updated message perhaps we may

1917
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:27,600
for some such as a kind type one such as

1918
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,840
first type one it may be cracked part of

1919
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,840
the others such as type two or type

1920
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,239
three maybe some errors so so in this

1921
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:39,760
case we may uh keep the type one rows uh

1922
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:40,719
uh

1923
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:43,520
and uh discard that then discard the

1924
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,920
errors such as type two and type three

1925
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,800
so i think this also may pass maybe a uh

1926
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:49,840
situation

1927
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,360
center role

1928
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,080
uh

1929
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,199
so

1930
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:55,840
i think the key thing is you have to be

1931
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:56,800
sure

1932
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:01,120
the whole field an li field all the mp

1933
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,679
reach and reach all the all the prefix

1934
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:05,520
are passed correctly

1935
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:06,800
and fully

1936
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,679
uh you cannot say okay i i i partially

1937
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:10,800
pass this

1938
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,800
this field then i keep whatever i i have

1939
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,159
whatever

1940
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:17,120
i have

1941
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:20,320
able to extract or have able to pass

1942
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,840
because at that point you don't know

1943
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,080
what is following uh because it's

1944
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,080
incremental you can remind pdp is

1945
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,800
incremental okay

1946
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,520
so at that time you are not sure you say

1947
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,719
okay do i is it better to keep this a

1948
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:35,840
but it is

1949
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,520
b as c

1950
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,600
uh becomes stale i mean you you are not

1951
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:43,960
sure and we is casing

1952
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:47,360
so i think if you look at the revised

1953
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:50,000
error handling spec that's

1954
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,880
what the fundamental is really you will

1955
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,159
be able to

1956
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:57,040
uh you know successfully

1957
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,960
past the whole

1958
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,679
field not partially right

1959
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,760
but when you know all the prefixes then

1960
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:04,960
you

1961
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,520
yeah you have there are ways to handle

1962
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,960
it more gracefully right

1963
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:12,480
you can use visa

1964
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,600
withdraw

1965
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,080
you can use you know tree that was true

1966
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,080
you can do that because you you know

1967
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,040
that

1968
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,800
you get all the prefixes you are not

1969
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,239
going to have still entries

1970
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,400
i think that's that's really fundamental

1971
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,480
i think we have to come to agreement on

1972
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:29,840
that

1973
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,000
okay okay i think uh we may just

1974
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,360
consider it uh

1975
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,159
uh for more okay and

1976
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:37,679
the other

1977
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:40,400
comments i think also is too much as

1978
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:44,239
perhaps we may i mean i will replied at

1979
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,719
the middle east okay

1980
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:49,760
yeah sure sure okay

1981
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,800
thank you okay jeff

1982
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,400
thank you uh so

1983
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,320
i'm going to

1984
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,320
very lightly repeat a couple of anchors

1985
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,360
points

1986
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,360
uh

1987
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,960
some of the things you're identifying in

1988
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:05,040
the draft look like they might be small

1989
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:08,800
changes to 7606 for some edge cases that

1990
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,199
might be okay to loosen you know please

1991
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:12,719
feel free to

1992
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:15,360
push on those as things be clarified i

1993
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,120
agree thinker that

1994
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,679
being able to have

1995
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:22,560
easier verification of a next top and

1996
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:23,920
decide you know if you want to use that

1997
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,360
as a criteria

1998
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,280
to avoid bouncing sessions may be also

1999
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,280
worth discussing

2000
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,960
the thing you're going to find and this

2001
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,520
is where i put on my working group chair

2002
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,280
hat

2003
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,440
there was considerable discussion about

2004
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,239
what to do about bad nlri

2005
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:41,760
that took up the majority of her

2006
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,199
discussion when we were going through

2007
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:44,080
the

2008
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,639
rfc 7606 process

2009
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:48,880
it's the one thing that is going to be

2010
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,600
the most difficult to convince people to

2011
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,760
revise

2012
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,000
i think there may be exactly one bit of

2013
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:56,880
room

2014
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,280
available that's sort of later learning

2015
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,520
since 7606 was done

2016
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,920
that gives us some option to do at least

2017
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,080
one level of revision

2018
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,480
which is if your implementation

2019
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:11,520
is guaranteed to only do one lri per

2020
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:15,280
update you completely break packing

2021
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,360
it's possible for you to do a check to

2022
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:20,480
see no am i overflowing a given pdu

2023
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:21,600
boundary

2024
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,360
and know that you have a

2025
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,840
you know single broken pdu

2026
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,239
this still as anchor points out leaves

2027
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:30,560
us in a case where that we have lost

2028
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,800
information and we no longer know if the

2029
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,719
withdrawal or the update that we're

2030
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:36,000
receiving

2031
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,679
is intended to update something we've

2032
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:40,159
already received

2033
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:42,400
and in those circumstances we'll be

2034
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,560
proceeding and leaving the session up as

2035
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,600
broken

2036
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,960
and this was one of the things that

2037
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,280
terrified people now we don't want to do

2038
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:51,360
this especially for internet

2039
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,760
but as we've discussed over the years

2040
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,080
bgp is used for things besides internet

2041
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,520
these days you know if this is your data

2042
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:00,000
center may be proceeding in a partially

2043
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,199
broken state makes more sense

2044
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:04,000
so

2045
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,159
my recommendation to you is

2046
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:07,199
now it's

2047
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:09,199
okay to discuss this point

2048
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:11,280
potentially discuss that there is some

2049
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,239
availability procedure for single nlri

2050
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:15,760
to allow us to proceed in a broken

2051
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:16,960
fashion

2052
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,120
and that this may make sense for some

2053
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,880
address families

2054
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,040
but not like the internet

2055
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,560
use cases

2056
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,400
an example of that is like the

2057
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,639
long-lived graceful restart feature

2058
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:30,239
now we put that out of scope for

2059
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:32,159
internet routes as part of you know the

2060
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:35,040
work that we did there

2061
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:40,560
uh okay thank you jeff

2062
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,400
thank you for your comments yeah

2063
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:45,360
uh yes uh uh

2064
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:49,120
as i as a as i think that uh

2065
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:51,360
for for the about uh

2066
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:54,320
the error across the pto i think this is

2067
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,360
no problem because

2068
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:59,920
even even even though we want to

2069
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:03,199
do best effort to pass the package

2070
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:06,159
but we still we are

2071
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:08,880
we still will follow the basic uh

2072
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,360
foundation about the pgp's

2073
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:12,239
rule

2074
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:14,960
so so i think it is

2075
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,719
whether we were to

2076
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:17,520
do

2077
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:21,280
it or not we may not

2078
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:25,360
obligate the pp's rules

2079
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,159
and uh the and for the under for the

2080
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:29,120
uh

2081
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:32,080
for the others we just in our in our

2082
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:34,400
purpose that we just want to

2083
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:35,520
learn

2084
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,280
don't want to

2085
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,280
reduce the impact of the

2086
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:42,080
pvp the error the error handling

2087
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:45,120
because now now although there are some

2088
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:48,800
nice dynamic capabilities modification

2089
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,280
mechanism tool can

2090
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,520
help reduce this but this is not an

2091
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,440
impairment

2092
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,400
at the network now

2093
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:59,360
so

2094
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,679
so we just want to uh

2095
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:05,679
do some to do as our best to

2096
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:09,040
to prevent the to prevent the bgp's

2097
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,040
neighbors uh uh

2098
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,960
neighbors uh

2099
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,840
never the reset so can make this can

2100
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,080
make the networks more

2101
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,280
stable

2102
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:23,040
state step up stability here

2103
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,520
right this is very much a discussion

2104
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,440
about operational safety this is

2105
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:28,880
partially the discussion that is

2106
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,960
happening in the uh chat

2107
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,960
and you know the original choice that we

2108
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:35,360
made was this is never safe

2109
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,880
you know what we have seen over the

2110
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,960
course of the years since that you know

2111
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,719
again using log lip graceful restart is

2112
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:43,120
the example

2113
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:45,199
if it's your network and it's strictly

2114
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:47,600
your routes you're leaving a session up

2115
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,880
until you can go through a maintenance

2116
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:51,199
procedure may make better sense

2117
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:52,719
leaving this in general internet means

2118
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:53,760
that you may be

2119
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,440
leaving black holes in the internet as a

2120
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,040
whole and we already have a number of

2121
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,120
bugs that cause that

2122
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,159
so

2123
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:01,440
we can continue that discussion on the

2124
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,839
mailing list

2125
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,239
okay uh thank you

2126
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:07,920
thank you thank you and i'll add my

2127
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:09,199
comments uh

2128
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:11,600
this is kev patel arkis as a working

2129
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,800
group member

2130
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,040
i will tell you that everything that nk

2131
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,760
and jeff said holds up so i'm not going

2132
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,199
to repeat that

2133
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:21,199
but one very interesting thing when we

2134
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:22,080
wrote

2135
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,159
enhance or revise error handling draft

2136
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:25,040
was

2137
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:25,720
there is no

2138
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:27,120
[Music]

2139
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,960
definite way

2140
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:32,880
to say after next top length error

2141
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,280
that the prefixes in empty reach are not

2142
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,040
corrupted

2143
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:37,920
so

2144
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,239
um if you can if you have a length error

2145
01:31:40,239 --> 01:31:42,159
of 0 0 or if you have a length error of

2146
01:31:42,159 --> 01:31:44,080
something some crazy length error that's

2147
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:47,360
shown in and it's an ipv6 session just

2148
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:48,880
plain old

2149
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:51,199
it's very hard to figure out that you're

2150
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:53,199
seeing a corruption on the stream or not

2151
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:55,520
at that point your best

2152
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,400
bet is to reset the session

2153
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,440
that also goes with the fact that if the

2154
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,440
update message is carrying one single

2155
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,440
prefix only because you have to wait for

2156
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,520
the next message to be parsed and figure

2157
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,520
out if the message is corrupted or not

2158
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,679
or are you going to see the marker even

2159
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:12,639
right

2160
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:14,960
so i think there are lots and lots of

2161
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:18,239
cases where you can't make

2162
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:20,800
it can't be guaranteed like nk said and

2163
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,120
you're going to hit that roadblock when

2164
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,280
you start solving some of these issues

2165
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,679
i'll also post my comments on on the

2166
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:29,520
mailing list yeah but thank you so much

2167
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:32,320
for the proposal

2168
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:38,280
okay okay with your comments thank you

2169
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:49,440
and we have quan who's going to talk

2170
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:51,199
about the flow specifications for the

2171
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:55,040
devnet flow mapping quant yeah thank you

2172
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,920
thank you jeff do you hear me

2173
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,320
yes i can hear you and i'm cave but jeff

2174
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:03,679
can hear you as well thank you

2175
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:04,960
yes thank you

2176
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:08,080
um i would like to introduce the bgp

2177
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:10,639
flow specification for that led flow

2178
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:14,480
mapping this slide please

2179
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:20,480
and this is night listed order of this

2180
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:24,320
related to tsm date plane including date

2181
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:28,159
plane framework ipo over tsn mps over

2182
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:32,000
tsn and tsn vpn over mpls

2183
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,040
so in the figure show the sled may

2184
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:38,000
provide the deterministic surface for

2185
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
the tsn end system

2186
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,840
and the ethernet ip and the nps flows

2187
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:46,960
may be carried over tsn sub networks

2188
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:50,639
so the flow mapping for tsn and

2189
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:54,320
that should be supported at the boundary

2190
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:55,360
loads

2191
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:58,239
let's slide this

2192
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:06,000
so regarding the uh dead plane there are

2193
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,159
two parts of requirements for the flow

2194
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:11,520
mapping first is the pro primary

2195
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,320
requirements of the controller plane for

2196
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:16,960
the tsn and the data flow mapping the

2197
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:19,679
mapping between tsn streams and the

2198
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:22,639
tesla flows is required for the service

2199
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:26,480
proxy function at data engineers and the

2200
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:29,600
mapping table can be configured and

2201
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,800
maintained in the control plane second

2202
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,320
is the aggregation of the flat flows one

2203
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:39,600
two one and into one mapping must be

2204
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,719
supported for example aggregating

2205
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:46,480
multiple tsn strings in a single should

2206
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:47,760
be supported

2207
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:48,560
so

2208
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,000
this document

2209
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,679
proposes extensions in control plate to

2210
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:57,040
bgp flow specification for the flow

2211
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:59,360
mapping by using the

2212
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,639
traffic of filtering rules to identify

2213
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:07,440
the packet and using the id associated

2214
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:10,960
action to map the packet to the related

2215
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,239
surface

2216
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:15,799
let's try please

2217
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:20,080
so based on the requirements uh this is

2218
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:24,400
the ptp fs extensions for uh tsm string

2219
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:27,040
magnitude

2220
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:28,400
the

2221
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,400
string identification

2222
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:34,400
uh functions are defined in suv

2223
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,679
and based on the the existing filtering

2224
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:38,719
rules

2225
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:42,560
this document just proposes a new type

2226
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:43,679
called

2227
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:46,400
mic service data newly

2228
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:50,480
it is an extension for l2 components

2229
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:53,280
flows back type for tsn traffic

2230
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:56,719
filtering in mask and

2231
01:35:56,719 --> 01:35:59,600
match stream identity

2232
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:03,360
and for traffic action of test screens

2233
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:07,679
the action is to accept the tsn strength

2234
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:10,000
matches the rule and map the strings to

2235
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:10,719
the

2236
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:12,080
flow

2237
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:15,760
so this document also proposed the

2238
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:18,880
the circle the sequence action extended

2239
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,400
community

2240
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:24,119
let's slice please

2241
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,400
and the four

2242
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:30,080
uh defect flow mapping to test string uh

2243
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,920
this document also

2244
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:35,920
dcw type in l-string components

2245
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:39,280
for that mpls flows uh the extended

2246
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:42,320
action for and that left that traffic

2247
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,480
filtering is to

2248
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:46,880
accept their tesla flows and match the

2249
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,280
ruler and map the flow to the tsn

2250
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,520
strings so a

2251
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:52,639
document

2252
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:55,040
this document also proposed the tsn

2253
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:58,080
action extended community

2254
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:59,679
and

2255
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:03,280
the tsn profile can be converted to the

2256
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,320
spring

2257
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:07,440
related parameters and the requirements

2258
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:10,719
including tsm string ids screen handle

2259
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:12,159
sequence number and the traffic

2260
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:15,040
expansion scheduling information

2261
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:18,920
now let's like this

2262
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,040
pfs extension for a tsm

2263
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:28,320
and definite mapping this draft has been

2264
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,520
presented in tesla yesterday uh we get

2265
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,719
feedback from that net and confirmed

2266
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:37,760
that this part of work is necessary

2267
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,119
and thanks

2268
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:42,000
thanks the suggestions from jeff

2269
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,440
we would like to present an idea to get

2270
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,719
more feedbacks about the extensions of

2271
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:50,880
their b2p flows back

2272
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:53,760
so any comment and discussion are very

2273
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:56,800
welcome thank you

2274
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:01,199
jeff you have the money

2275
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:02,480
thank you

2276
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,719
and quan thank you for bringing this

2277
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:07,840
work also to idr's attention

2278
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,040
as you're

2279
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,679
discussing flowspec is interesting work

2280
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:14,719
that is not only happening in idr but is

2281
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:16,480
getting leveraged and multiple working

2282
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:20,800
groups including that pce and elsewhere

2283
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,199
a piece of work that is challenging

2284
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:27,600
that has come out as part of rfc 8955

2285
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,480
as we updated flowspec version one

2286
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:33,600
as we understand that it's not safe in

2287
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,840
current circumstances to extend close

2288
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:38,080
back with new capabilities like what is

2289
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,239
inside of your draft

2290
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:42,480
so part of the work that idr is

2291
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:45,440
discussing that you saw earlier today

2292
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,280
is that we are doing a flow spec version

2293
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,480
too

2294
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,040
and we would like to invite you to

2295
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,360
contribute work there as well and if you

2296
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,199
have not worked with donald already

2297
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:57,679
certainly he would be happy to look at

2298
01:38:57,679 --> 01:38:59,440
this not only because of his flow spec

2299
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:02,480
v2 work but also the overlap of you know

2300
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:06,239
this potentially with the l2 vpn

2301
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:09,920
okay

2302
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:12,719
thank you so uh we will

2303
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:15,360
update the extensions based on the flows

2304
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:18,080
back version 2 last version

2305
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,400
thanks

2306
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:26,759
thank you any more questions for juan

2307
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:37,440
thank you thank you koan

2308
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,600
folks that was our last presentation in

2309
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,199
today's session thank you all for

2310
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:43,280
attending if there are no more questions

2311
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:46,800
we'll see you at next ietf

2312
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:54,040
thank you folks

2313
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,960
hopefully see you all in person next

2314
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:59,119
time

2315
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:04,280
thank you

2316
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:53,760
you
