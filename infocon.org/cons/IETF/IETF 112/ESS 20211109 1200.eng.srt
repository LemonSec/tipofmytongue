1
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,760
the top of the hour so it's time to kick

2
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,800
off

3
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,800
this new best session

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,440
for this virtual etf 112

5
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,840
not

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,960
well so

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,520
if some people are not aware about it

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,840
please uh please read it but it should

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,680
be well known for most of the people

10
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,479
here is our agenda it's pretty packed

11
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,040
so to all the speakers

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,560
uh please

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,479
keep your timing

14
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,119
and don't overlap otherwise we will have

15
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,439
some issues we have a very limited

16
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,158
buffer today

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,360
status update

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,400
so we have four rfcs that have been

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,720
published since the last summer idf

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,040
two are really interesting

21
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,920
so it took a lot of time but

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,119
at the end we succeeded to publish

23
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,079
the rfv2 rfcs that are related to our

24
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,360
evpn routing so vr irb

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,600
evpn as well as via

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,079
ip prefix advertisement so this is uh it

27
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,520
took a lot of time but this is a very

28
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,039
good a very good achievement

29
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,880
we have one rfc in the rfc editor queue

30
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,240
which is the proxy app nd and we have a

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,960
bunches of rf ref

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,440
drafts that are

33
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,399
either

34
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,520
under martin's review or at the

35
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,520
iesg

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,520
stage

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,920
we have uh two documents that are still

38
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,480
under shepard's review uh one which is

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,280
related to evp and lsp ping

40
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,680
so matthew if i'm not mistaken has to do

41
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,480
video right up on this one

42
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,720
we have also the unequal

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,239
load balancing

44
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,560
so i think the review has been done

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,720
so this document is just waiting for

46
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,920
some

47
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,239
dependencies to be served before before

48
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,879
we move forward otherwise

49
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,480
i think we were good at this one

50
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,560
uh we have one document

51
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,200
in our working room classical queue

52
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,640
which is via edna fast df

53
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,200
recovery

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,440
we have two documents that are still

55
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,920
under working replace call call

56
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,120
for a long time so on v i see the smack

57
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,400
flash

58
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,200
unfortunately we got very very few

59
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
feedback and responses during the

60
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,280
working rash call

61
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,519
so matthew requested a routing

62
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,720
directorate review on this one

63
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,840
so i think ross was appointed i provided

64
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,480
a couple of comments that video first

65
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,239
have two uh

66
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,480
two answers before before we can move

67
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,799
forward

68
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,440
on the ibm ws

69
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,159
vpws fxc

70
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,599
i think on this one we got a good amount

71
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,680
of support to move forward however we

72
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,200
are still missing

73
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,599
an ipr reply from

74
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,879
from ali

75
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,560
so as soon as we

76
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,480
as soon as we get it i think we will be

77
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,079
able to move to here to the next step

78
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,478
uh similarly

79
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,759
we have the

80
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,800
bgp evgp dmz

81
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,479
draft

82
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,800
under working group adoption

83
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,840
but we are still missing some uh ipr

84
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,400
response so i don't i don't know if we

85
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,800
have sat here

86
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,080
uh

87
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,520
connected no satya isn't there

88
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,040
so yeah two voters please reply to vr to

89
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,280
the ipr poll so we can we can move

90
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,400
forward with the adoption

91
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,840
working group document updates

92
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,639
so you will be able to review offline so

93
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,639
this is the latest update that we have

94
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,000
for the

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,479
uh documents uh

96
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,520
a couple of things to highlight

97
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,479
so

98
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,000
on mhps becoming protective there was a

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,560
single plus call that

100
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,360
failed it seems that the comments have

101
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,160
been addressed by the offer so i need to

102
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,720
check if everything has been resolved

103
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,479
and then we can move forward

104
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,240
evp genies there was also a

105
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,840
couple comments received during the

106
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,919
working replace call that needs to be

107
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,479
addressed

108
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,010
evp and ipp aren't working

109
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,080
[Music]

110
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,680

111
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,160

the multicast flow df election draft um

140
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,800
we think this is going to be ready for

141
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,360
working group last call soon so that's

142
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,120
in our queue

143
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,759
um the mvpn siemens interrupt draft is

144
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,960
on the agenda today um

145
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,319
evpn bfd and sd1 usage so evpn bfd do

146
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,160
any of the authors or any of the authors

147
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,080
on in the meeting that they can give us

148
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,800
a quick update on that

149
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,599
okay so i treat that as ongoing i think

150
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,000
um sd-wan usage um

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,319
so linda has asked for working group

152
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,720
last call on that um we've just got an

153
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,560
open point about the depend whether

154
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,599
there's a dependency on that and some

155
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,159
companion work in the idr

156
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,000
uh working group i don't know if linda

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,080
is on them in the meeting to

158
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,320
say something

159
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,720
hey

160
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,959
go ahead zenda you're asking me to do

161
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,519
some oh the companion working idr has

162
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,720
been adopted in idr and so this is the

163
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,399
base document that one depends on

164
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,399
because this is the usage basically

165
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,600
showing how btp used over there has some

166
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,480
bgp extensions so i hope this one

167
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,680
finished first

168
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,279
before that one can

169
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,560
finish

170
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,080
okay

171
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,240
but there's no normative dependency of

172
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,800
this draft on that one right

173
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,160
no no okay

174
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,800
so go ahead

175
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,240
excuse me the drafts are independent you

176
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,160
the one in idr can go toward

177
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,680
working group last call but remember idr

178
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,640
requires two implementations

179
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,080
thank you

180
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,600
thank you

181
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,839
okay

182
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,959
um so i think apart from that we'd like

183
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,080
to see a little bit more working group

184
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,600
review of this draft so we'll probably

185
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,640
initiate we will initiate a request a

186
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
routing area directorate review

187
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,519
of the draft and please do uh review the

188
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,800
draft and

189
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,079
send any comments to the list

190
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,079
um this is the uh

191
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,000
monotony split horizon draft um

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,160
so we believe that's ready to progress

193
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
to the next step which would be working

194
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,920
group article

195
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,200
um

196
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,279
the extended evpn optimized ir draft um

197
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,640
so the authors have said that they

198
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,880
believe it's ready to move forward

199
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,640
um martin's waiting for the um

200
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
the bomb procedures draft to move ahead

201
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,399
for this one

202
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,440
um

203
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,200
bgp multicast um this will be

204
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
ready for working group last call after

205
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,320
an update of the document

206
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,680
the irb extended mobility draft

207
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,760
is ready to move forward

208
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,640
now the dependencies have been resolved

209
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,880
and as we stated before the yang models

210
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,560
are mostly on hold for the time being

211
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,320
while we progress some of the other work

212
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,839
um next slide

213
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,160
okay so the rfc 7432 bis draft so there

214
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,120
were

215
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,399
a few changes in this um

216
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,640
i don't know if any of the authors are

217
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,800
on the in the meeting apart from stefan

218
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,120
uh who can get maybe talk about this

219
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,440
update

220
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,880
look

221
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,600
yeah yes go ahead thank you

222
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,279
uh sorry yeah so it's it's actually um

223
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,880
zero two is actually a fairly mechanical

224
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,720
update so we received uh four sets of

225
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,560
feedbacks

226
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,279
uh one of them actually is uh

227
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,000
is is a bit of a slip or or a purposeful

228
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,959
emission from rfc 85

229
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,160
84 i think it is or 8534

230
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,240
via the df election draft

231
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,519
previously sort of specified how to um

232
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,440
auto attract auto extract yes important

233
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,720
route targets but that was removed at

234
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,440
the last minute before publication

235
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,639
um so that's incorporated here

236
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,360
and then uh the other

237
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,480
i guess substantive changes in section

238
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,279
8.5

239
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,120
it's uh specifying the deflection

240
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,880
behavior for

241
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,519
um two different originating ips soybean

242
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,720
fee

243
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,959
uh v4 and fev5

244
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,399
and the rest is

245
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,720
fairly mechanical

246
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,519
uh wording changes and um

247
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,200
just updating sort of the applicability

248
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,279
of flow label both signaling and data

249
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,320
okay next slide

250
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,480
i think we we are done with you okay so

251
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,800
nick thank you next up is uh castlevan

252
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,760
um

253
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,200
stephanie if you could share the slides

254
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,200
for the vpn seamless intro

255
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,480
do you want to see if you can take over

256
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,600
now stuff and see if your audio is

257
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,800
improved

258
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,920
yeah okay thanks

259
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,120
hello everyone can you hear me

260
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,959
yeah yeah good

261
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:09,920
thank you

262
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
hey everyone uh this is cason throwing

263
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,360
the summit from cisco

264
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,959
uh this is about an update to the

265
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,560
existing iuvpn seamless interrupt draft

266
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,800
so this draft describes a procedure to

267
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,959
do seamless interrupt between evpn and

268
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,399
mep and pe

269
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,399
the same procedure can also be used to

270
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,480
do optimized inter subnet forwarding

271
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,320
with an evpn fabric

272
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,440
oh this is a old slider

273
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,719
uh

274
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,120
this is uh

275
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,519
uh this is old slide deck so can i share

276
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,079
the new one

277
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,880
yeah go ahead if you if you request it

278
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,839
we can give you permission

279
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,680
that's i'm trying to ground sets and

280
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,719
this is not doing it

281
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,360
uploaded the new slides for case one and

282
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,920
uh jeffries

283
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,680
uh can you see my screen or no

284
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,239
uh yeah

285
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,639
well okay

286
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,000
lots of recursion on your screen

287
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,760
that's good i can see the c powerpoint

288
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,800
now

289
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,000
okay

290
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,440
so uh

291
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,120
so this draft has been adopted as

292
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,000
working group document in 2019.

293
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,800
so in property l2 eupmpe was not covered

294
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,279
that time so this has been covered now

295
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,120
and addition few section has been

296
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,480
reorganized

297
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,320
so i'm probably i'm primarily covering

298
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,880
uh l2 vpn evpart right now

299
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,040
uh

300
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
so what's needed uh

301
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,199
for intra so

302
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,880
you get a gateway device needed to

303
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,399
reinterpret the l2 uh l2 uvp is

304
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,760
your turn and domain uh can be

305
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
provisioned with uh one or more gateway

306
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,000
device uh known as you know seamless

307
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,720
entrapy vpn gateway cpe which is

308
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,560
configured as uh gateway must be

309
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,079
provisioned with all bds that are

310
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,839
available in the tenant system

311
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,120
so given set of eligible pds ps1p is

312
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,199
selected as a df

313
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,040
so any of the existing evp and df

314
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,719
selection procedure can be used for this

315
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,800
so there are uh four possible use cases

316
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,720
depending upon whether the remote p or

317
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,160
local p supports igmp mld proxy

318
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,880
so it's this this can be supported

319
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,519
either at a seamless entropy or remote

320
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,320
pe

321
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,600
or you know a few set of uh uh l2 evpn

322
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,440
pas

323
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,519
so uh

324
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,600
there are four cases uh but primarily we

325
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,279
will just you know build l2 multicast

326
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,920
state uh either by smart out or igp

327
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,320
control plane depending upon whether the

328
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,720
remote p or local ps supports a multi

329
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,440
proxy draft

330
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,720
so operation overview so uh given set of

331
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,519
you know uh eligible gateway nodes uh

332
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,199
one node will one node will be elected

333
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,399
as idea

334
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,079
so the df uh will uh detect a remote p

335
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,360
capability

336
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,839
and based on that it it tries to learn

337
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,399
l2 multicast state either 3s not out or

338
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,560
igmp rpm control packets

339
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
so the ddf will act as a latcher for

340
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,040
receiver behind the l2 ebp with respect

341
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,360
to other seamless interrupt capable pe

342
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,519
as well as me pnp

343
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,839
uh the df will also act as a fr for

344
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,639
sources behind l2 evpnp with respect to

345
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,720
other seamless interrupt capable p as

346
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,480
well as mep and pe

347
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,040
so the df uses bump tunnel uh for

348
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,839
traffic forwarding towards clp vpnp

349
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,799
uh the df uses you know where tunnel or

350
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,039
mvp internal for traffic forwarding

351
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,439
towards other me pnp as well as other

352
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,039
seamless in top capabilities

353
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,640
so this is uh you know quick overview so

354
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,720
so i've seen that uh so here like you

355
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,959
know uh the blue the blue notes are uh

356
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,039
seamless in drop cable p

357
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,080
and p four and p e five are seamless uh

358
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,080
interrupt cable p uh which are

359
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,000
configures like you know gateway

360
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,320
so between these two nodes as in the

361
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,840
techno p5 got elected as a df

362
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,880
now uh it tries to send smart start slot

363
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,840
out to uh pull

364
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,960
uh all uh source traffic towards uh uh

365
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,280
uh dear so that it can act as a first

366
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,880
stop router so i think that like you

367
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,280
know now sources are tasked behind the p

368
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,480
p eight

369
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,799
so as soon as so start sending traffic

370
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,480
so it's going to send traffic towards

371
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,360
you know pe5 so pa5 will start

372
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,720
advertising you know ipip ip vpn and

373
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,520
evpn host routes towards uh evpn fabric

374
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,360
as well as mpn fabrics

375
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,840
with associated uh with uh

376
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,039
associated with import community

377
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,799
now uh assume that we have a receiver

378
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,679
behind the pe one so uh when it detects

379
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,120
uh uh mvpn uh ac routes it starts

380
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,240
sending mvpn type 67 towards remote pe

381
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,559
and it start pulling the traffic via uh

382
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,000
verb tunnel

383
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,440
so now uh

384
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,840
this is like you know for l3 l3 case now

385
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,919
assume that you have a

386
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,400
receiver behind pa7 which is you know

387
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,960
lte vpn pe so this can send uh

388
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,840
the interest to uh df either through

389
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,640
smart route or igp control packet

390
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,799
depending upon whether p7 support you

391
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,240
know igp proxy draft

392
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,080
we are just learning l2 multicast state

393
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,440
at pa5

394
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,400
so once we learn the state uh then it it

395
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,960
it's try to create a l2 state then

396
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,120
again it sends a request to irb

397
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
interface then we will just create your

398
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,240
three state

399
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,799
so now uh when p is eight sends a

400
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,760
traffic uh towards p5 see it does like a

401
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,480
local routing on irb 30 assume that like

402
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,240
a receiver has began uh

403
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,480
vlan 30 at pa7

404
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,799
then after routing it will try to send

405
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,799
the traffic towards the pe 7 using l2

406
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,039
state

407
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,600
now uh

408
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,840
so this is about you know source behind

409
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,720
a

410
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,960
seamless entropy what will happen in

411
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,799
this case it's pretty much you know pe

412
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,120
three since uh p5 will pull the traffic

413
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,080
from p3 using uh mepn signaling

414
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,600
when uh it has received behind the pa7

415
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,799
so the p5 doesn't advertise any host out

416
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,559
uh pe3 will take care of that

417
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,080
this is about uh

418
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,360
new flags uh in evp multicast uh

419
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,880
extended community

420
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,280
so this uh multicast flux extent

421
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,760
community is defined in uh a igmp

422
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,360
multiplexing dropped

423
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,840
so uh bit 14 and

424
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,960
bit 15 are used by a gmp multiplexing

425
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,039
draft so now we have proposed two

426
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,400
additional bits

427
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,960
for seamless interrupt uh draft so bit

428
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,280
13 indicates seamless and drop capable

429
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,720
pe and b12 uh indicates uh indicates

430
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,880
that this uh p is capable of you know

431
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,480
acting as a gateway

432
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,280
so uh so all eligible gateways will set

433
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,440
these flags and uh one of them will act

434
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,559
as a df

435
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,159
okay okay so can you try and wrap it up

436
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,000
please because uh i think we're out of

437
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,919
time on this one yeah yeah so this is

438
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,039
last complaint

439
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,000
okay so yeah so this drought has been

440
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,960
around for almost five years um yes it's

441
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,320
widely deployed

442
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,159
requesting last call if there are any

443
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,679
comments or feedback uh we will just

444
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,440
sing ticket

445
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,640
all right

446
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,679
okay really quick

447
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,159
yeah hi

448
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,799
can you hear me

449
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,880
yeah very quick um so the uh bits uh 12

450
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,280
and 13 in the multicast accident

451
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
community are taken and they are

452
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,919
actually uh used in in two drafts uh

453
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,640
one of the angus and last call the oism

454
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,760
draft

455
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,520
so yeah we should remove it from from

456
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,840
this draft as soon as possible

457
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,440
and the other comment i have is the oism

458
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,960
draft uh also defines uh

459
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,000
procedures for l2 multicast uh

460
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,760
um you know

461
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,320
interoperability so i wonder if you if

462
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,840
you look at

463
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,280
that draft for that specific uh

464
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,120
procedure

465
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,679
yes i looked at that so both are you

466
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,240
know handling two different uh uh

467
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,600
problems

468
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,480
uh so

469
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,280
so why is purely uh based on evp

470
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,559
signaling etcetera it's here like you

471
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,919
know we are just using anything uh

472
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,320
signaling between evp so uh some

473
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,159
additional producers are okay so that

474
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,679
has been captured here

475
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,120
so with respect to uh bits um yeah so uh

476
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,120
when i looked at last time um so i

477
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,200
haven't you know find uh any bits so

478
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,039
that's why i just you know took it

479
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,039
uh yeah i can just you know take a look

480
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,880
at that uh then i can just move the bits

481
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,520
yes please

482
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,080
thank you

483
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,039
okay

484
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,039
when unfortunately we don't have time we

485
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,720
have to move to the next slot so if you

486
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,640
have a question please please take it to

487
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,880
the list sorry

488
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,840
sure

489
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,240
thank you

490
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,520
okay next presenter

491
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,760
luke henry

492
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,559
hi

493
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,039
um should i should i uh share my screen

494
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,240
stephanie

495
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,960
i'm sharing okay okay perfect

496
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,400
um

497
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,880
so i'll be presenting draft builder best

498
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,120
evpn fast reroute on behalf of my

499
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,520
partners patrice and takuya from kddi

500
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,480
so this draft takes a look at um

501
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
evpn convergence solutions that exist

502
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,559
today and how convergence is achieved

503
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,880
for evpn deployments

504
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,240
so evpn based convergence is

505
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,640
largely control plane driven today

506
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,080
it's um

507
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,799
it's

508
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,240
route scale dependent topology dependent

509
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,960
and uh largely depends on

510
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
uh any delays in the network right raw

511
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,799
reflector uh network delays and so on

512
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,600
so there is a straightforward solution

513
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,200
which is

514
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,159
um using the peers service label as an

515
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,760
edge redirect

516
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,559
uh however um

517
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,039
there are two uh major problems with

518
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,320
this solution

519
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,240
uh that sort of has been floating out

520
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,320
there for a while the two problems are

521
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,600
basically that if if we use this peers

522
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,520
service label

523
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,840
uh it may lead to loops in the network

524
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,960
between the two peering pes

525
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,279
um or extra data plane work to to

526
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,640
prevent that

527
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,279
and um using the peer service label for

528
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,640
redirects actually does not work for all

529
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,240
for all existing load balancing modes

530
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,200
so with that premise effectively e-10

531
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,080
convergence can't reasonably meet

532
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,720
any sub-second or

533
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,240
uh you know even more stringent than

534
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,159
sub-second converged requirements

535
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,640
uh so in the next slide this draft

536
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,000
proposes

537
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,360
an approach to achieve class convergence

538
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,559
um so the only way to achieve rapid

539
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,640
convergence uh for evpn is to remove the

540
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,559
reliance on the control thing uh so what

541
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,559
this means is

542
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,880
uh effectively local failure detection

543
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,919
at pu1 and local failure restoration at

544
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,520
pe-1

545
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,240
where then the control plane so then the

546
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,480
crimp the edit procedures would kick in

547
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,080
as we know them right the edit then mass

548
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,279
withdraw and the correction of the

549
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,760
control plane

550
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,120
so this draft

551
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,559
addresses uh you know rerouting evpn

552
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,440
traffic at the edge uh in particular i'm

553
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,000
gonna go over uh issues with using the

554
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,080
peer service label

555
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,000
so the issue of the continuous reroutes

556
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,159
if multiple failures that p1 and p2 are

557
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,360
detected

558
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,159
and in the second step i'm going to be

559
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,200
covering effectively rerouting to a

560
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,320
non-df interface

561
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,720
so in the next slide

562
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,159
okay so in ebp and all active

563
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,559
if you consider two pes that are

564
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,880
connected to a ce in all active mode

565
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,640
which is fairly a fairly typical human

566
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,120
employment and you have a failure that

567
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,200
occurs at

568
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,919
the self switch

569
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,760
so what's going to happen is the lag

570
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,159
failures will be detected simultaneously

571
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,640
at pe 1 and pe 2.

572
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,039
so with any kind of

573
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,799
reroute active

574
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,039
it's it's very easy to observe how

575
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,400
basically

576
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,480
uh pe one will be redirecting to pe two

577
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,000
and p2 will be redirecting to pe one

578
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,600
and and that's gonna

579
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,279
continue until

580
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,400
you know it's going to generate a

581
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,799
traffic storm between p1 and p2 and it

582
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,440
will continue until either ttl drop or

583
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,520
uh

584
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,679
or forever

585
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,840
so

586
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,080
if you go to the next slide the solution

587
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,360
proposed actually

588
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,520
um it proposes a

589
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,840
a specially allocated downstream uh

590
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,880
label

591
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,159
which i i

592
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,400
you know i call the reroute label

593
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,919
and what's different between this

594
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,559
reroute label and the um

595
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,720
standard vpn edp and service label

596
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,480
disposition

597
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,200
is in standard disposition basically

598
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,440
uh the traffic from the north from from

599
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,320
the e3 to pe1

600
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,720
will use um a

601
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,240
what i call a state-based forwarding

602
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,559
chain depending on the ac so if the ac

603
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,480
is up the traffic will be get sent from

604
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,279
be1 to the switch on the south if the ac

605
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,120
is down typically traffic will be

606
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,600
dropped but if i use for example the

607
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,000
peers reroute label

608
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,640
the ac down can be re-encapsulated with

609
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,120
this reroute table

610
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,880
um so far so good and that's basically

611
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,399
the same thing as

612
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,679
the the proposal using the service label

613
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,039
however

614
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,520
by using a specially allocated label at

615
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,200
pe2

616
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,919
the the disposition of the reroute label

617
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,279
at pe2 of the once rerouted packet is

618
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,600
terminal so it's a final disposition

619
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,440
right so this disposition occurs at p2

620
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,799
of the packet that was rerouted from pe1

621
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,960
and

622
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,120
it happens regardless of the ac state

623
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,559
the packet is either forwarded or

624
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,960
dropped into the ac

625
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,200
so in this case here where both acs are

626
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,640
down

627
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,960
the packet coming from pe3 that arrives

628
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,679
at pe1 that is effectively rerouted over

629
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,159
to pe2

630
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,240
arrives at pe2 with the disposition

631
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,840
label that doesn't care about the ac

632
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,880
state

633
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,000
so if the ac is down pe 2 will not try

634
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,679
to redirect this packet so the once

635
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,360
rerouted packet that comes in with this

636
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,640
special label

637
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,760
will will now get dropped

638
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,000
uh and so because this is a downstream

639
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,480
allocated label at the e2

640
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,559
um there are no no data plane

641
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,080
modifications required i don't need to

642
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,919
change anything in the core

643
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,159
i basically need to track only a special

644
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,559
attribute on that label at pe 2 and

645
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,279
advertise it into evpn

646
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,840
um there's also no further no extra

647
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,600
labels on the stack so i'm not adding a

648
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,840
label onto the

649
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,000
onto the forwarding stack

650
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,919
it just replaces the service label for

651
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,679
the traffic from pe one to be two

652
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,720
on the next slide

653
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,760
so this is a bit of a heavier slide

654
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,760
but uh the the premise is actually very

655
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,039
simple

656
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,240
if the switch or sorry if p1 and p2 are

657
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,480
operating in

658
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,200
uh single active mode

659
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,919
what what you'll see is effectively pe3

660
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,320
sends traffic to pe1

661
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
which is down so without a reroute we

662
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,159
lose traffic at pe one

663
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,880
if i use this reroute label or if i use

664
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,960
for example the um

665
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,799
uh the service label

666
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,039
p1 re-routes to p2

667
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,799
but i haven't really gained much there

668
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,880
because p 2 is still is still waiting

669
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
for control plane to convert so p 2 is

670
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,320
still non dx and we'll drop the

671
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,880
re-routed traffic

672
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,600
so

673
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,399
by uh by allocating this special rerub

674
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,279
label

675
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,480
again it's the same label as the

676
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,159
previous use case

677
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,120
this reroute label carries effectively

678
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,960
um

679
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,559
a context of the fact that it is a a

680
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,640
once forwarded packet it is a reroute

681
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,039
packet and at pe 2 it has a special

682
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,200
characteristic allowing it to bypass the

683
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,720
collection

684
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,399
so while control plane is busy

685
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,480
reconverging over to pe2

686
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,559
this once rerouted packet will actually

687
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,240
bypass df election it is allowed to

688
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,559
bypass the reflection

689
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,159
uh and you'll see how this is is

690
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,080
especially applicable to load balancing

691
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,760
modes like uh single active uh and to a

692
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,279
lesser extent port active also

693
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,120
uh so the traffic ends up getting

694
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,360
rerouted much faster than the df

695
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,440
election procedures

696
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,519
uh and but then rely

697
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,360
on the df election procedures to restore

698
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,600
traffic using the

699
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,159
uh what i thought was purple but uh the

700
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,960
the purple uh traffic path from pe three

701
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,519
to pe two so traffic does reconverge and

702
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,960
takes the load off of the rear up path

703
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,320
uh next slide that's the phone please

704
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,840
so i have here um

705
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,840
implementation results so the table in

706
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,200
this slide

707
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,559
at the bottom of the slide highlights

708
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,360
the typical results

709
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,880
that are seen with an implementation of

710
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,080
this draft

711
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,679
uh so this is storing implementation

712
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,519
results from from shipping code for some

713
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,720
time now

714
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,159
and you can see actually there's two

715
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,519
things that i that i want to highlight

716
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,840
on this slide is

717
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,600
first of all by using this reroute you

718
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,679
can you can achieve

719
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,799
some 50 millisecond traffic restoration

720
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,960
and the other important part to that

721
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,120
sort of jumps out is the fact that this

722
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,120
plays

723
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,919
orthogonally to fast recovery procedures

724
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,039
right so the the fast recovery

725
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,000
uh in blue here is not being exercised

726
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,080
uh but that is the other the other draft

727
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,519
that is in working group last call and

728
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,200
this

729
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,000
complements that effectively

730
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,799
and with that i am done

731
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,960
you just have one minute left

732
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,279
for questions or

733
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,360
including questions yeah

734
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,039
yeah uh so who's the first in the queue

735
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,440
hi bo

736
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,200
hello hello luke yeah

737
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,960
uh can you hear me

738
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,039
yes

739
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,080
firstly i agree with your proposal uh

740
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,399
but i think i find that uh there was a

741
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,960
drought of team general before

742
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,919
i think

743
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,840
we may go

744
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,519
general

745
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,279
doctor named

746
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,720
fr label uepf label is always

747
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,159
same general with you

748
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,320
thank you okay maybe i think me offline

749
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,279
we can discuss

750
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,159
so i have a questions a couple comments

751
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,440
one you know an evpn fr for known

752
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,200
unicast traffic you can done this with

753
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,440
um as you mentioned with a special label

754
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,519
so the um

755
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,799
at the there's a draft presented a

756
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,640
couple ideas ago

757
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,559
but was uh um

758
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,360
using uh specially not using a special

759
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,760
level with your proposal at the comments

760
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,399
is you also need to consider a vlan

761
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,440
aware bundle service

762
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,240
and

763
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,080
if you have a

764
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,159
forbidden aware bundle service you may

765
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,799
have a 4k bridge domain and

766
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,200
also need to consider

767
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,040
the label allocation scheme was

768
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,280
used it could be a label assigned a

769
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,440
property in that case you may need

770
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,679
one label for reroute for each bd and so

771
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,560
it depends label probability label per

772
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,719
mac or label per verb

773
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,879
right i actually agree with you when so

774
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,960
i left that out

775
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,960
i left that out of the presentation i do

776
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,359
go into it a little bit so we do address

777
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,040
it in the draft to certain to a certain

778
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,879
extent but i left it out of this

779
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,960
presentation because effectively all

780
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,480
three can be done

781
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,599
um yes so so the special label can be

782
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,719
per bridge per ac or per uh per mac and

783
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,280
the the net effect would actually be the

784
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,159
same

785
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,159
because it's a it's a local decision at

786
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,480
pe 2 of what label that's allocated

787
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,800
that's right and uh but you need to

788
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,680
consider in that case once and

789
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,160
especially labeled for bridge domain or

790
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,440
labor pro evi this is it has much to do

791
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,079
with the forwarding model

792
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,720
then you need to do them and you have to

793
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,079
support 240 model in the local pe in

794
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,920
that case

795
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,680
maybe it will be

796
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,000
convenient just to make its

797
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,400
implementation simpler it has a one

798
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,560
forwarding scheme on the egress pe

799
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,280
otherwise you need to do

800
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,119
different forwarding scheme

801
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,960
because of label allocation different

802
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,280
label allocations

803
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,119
and

804
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,720
yeah

805
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,000
yeah this this is the scale concern yeah

806
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,640
okay i'm really sorry but we have to uh

807
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,880
to together yeah i just have one mistake

808
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,920
yeah

809
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,359
one woman one more comment about no no

810
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,000
i'm sorry we are already out of time

811
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,480
when unfortunately

812
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,480
yeah i'll connect with you offline

813
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,520
yeah thank you thank you

814
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,960
okay next presenter ali

815
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,800
you guys hear me

816
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,000
hello

817
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
yeah

818
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,920
okay i think we lost the stephan

819
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,000
um

820
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,400
he's still there

821
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,200
yeah

822
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,720
you can do it

823
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,320
okay great

824
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,760
uh so uh this is a uh

825
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,200
updated

826
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,160
version for the secure evpn

827
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,200
uh rev05

828
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,720
and nexus y

829
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,960
hello okay

830
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,440
uh so a little bit of about the history

831
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,920
of this draft uh uh

832
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,280
the

833
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,640
latest uh rev uh uh

834
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,920
the main uh difference between this rev

835
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,160
zero five and the previous

836
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,760
uh river f-zero f03

837
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,280
that was

838
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,320
uh presented uh is

839
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,240
the merge of uh

840
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,880
uh ipsec enemy control ike

841
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,760
draft which was a companion draft of

842
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,359
this trap into

843
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:24,480
here

844
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,079
and

845
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,400
the two got merged because of the

846
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,280
synergy between them

847
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,200
to have a

848
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,960
one comprehensive giraffe that covers

849
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,520
both the procedure of the wreaking as

850
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,160
well as the framework and the

851
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,000
architecture

852
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,079
for the security vpn and the

853
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,160
bgp

854
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,359
routes that are needed

855
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,440
so

856
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,160
next slide

857
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,720
the

858
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,640
main changes relative to

859
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,480
rev03

860
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,040
is basically the addition of section

861
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,920
four and five and uh section

862
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,040
uh four uh talks about the

863
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,320
generating the initial ipsec security

864
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,720
associations and the

865
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,480
section

866
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,560
for the two gets into the reking of

867
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,920
these uh sh

868
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,520
and

869
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,000
it covers a

870
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,040
single ip6 device wiki as well as the

871
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,880
multiple

872
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,920
reclaim for the multiple devices

873
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,920
section 5

874
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,839
covers

875
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,680
ipsec database generation that

876
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,200
includes

877
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,839
security policy database and security

878
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,200
association database

879
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,200
as well as a appear authorization

880
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,240
database so those are and these sections

881
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,040
basically got lifted from the

882
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,560
ipsec me uh

883
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,800
carol draft in here

884
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,800
next

885
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,880
another change in here was

886
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,079
the

887
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,440
correction for one of the encapsulation

888
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,280
it covers

889
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,640
correction for the diagram uh

890
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,280
there are two uh encapsulation one is uh

891
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,839
vx landing cab within the esp and then

892
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,480
one is vxram within the

893
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,520
esp which is in uh itself incorporated

894
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,440
within the udp uh

895
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,359
uh figure five of the draft uh

896
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,079
uh in the previous rev it was correct

897
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,240
but the there was a current page zero

898
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,560
and uh we corrected that uh that issue

899
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,480
in this round

900
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,280
next slide

901
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,560
so basically uh this draft

902
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,040
has been around for a few years and it

903
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,440
has been stable and baked

904
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,680
and uh after the

905
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,440
we were waiting for

906
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,280
merging the draft

907
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,359
uh with the other one and i think right

908
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,280
now that uh

909
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,079
we got it merge uh and everything is in

910
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,480
one place it is ready for a working

911
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,359
group adoption co

912
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,160
uh

913
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,200
all right

914
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,960
that is the

915
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,440
end of my presentation

916
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,520
okay

917
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,280
we can go to the questions when

918
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,000
when you're in you're on mute

919
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,480
do you mind

920
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,520
what head stuff

921
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,800
okay we get what happened

922
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,680
okay

923
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,760
sue

924
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,880
do you want to go ahead with your

925
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,880
question

926
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,280
we are not able to hear you

927
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,200
we can't hear you

928
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,240
ali thank you for

929
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,440
uh merging the two drafts i can see that

930
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,400
there's uh quite a lot of text moved in

931
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,359
from

932
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,240
uh the draft i will ask one key question

933
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,119
and then follow up with minor points to

934
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,480
the list the main question is how much

935
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,079
dependence

936
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,319
does the web of trust in bgp play for

937
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,079
the security associations in other words

938
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,040
how much is that the key requirement

939
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,000
for the security and how much does

940
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,680
section 4 work

941
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,839
or

942
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,119
work based on that

943
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,359
uh so uh for the bgp sessions we expect

944
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,119
the uh

945
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,240
bgp sessions uh to be completely secure

946
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,520
and uh either to be done via the tls or

947
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,480
ipsec so those the connection between

948
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,040
the pes and rrs

949
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,599
the bgp connection uh it is expected to

950
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,240
be completely secure

951
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,160
so that is that

952
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,240
that is the base requirement for all the

953
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,280
security that follows in the draft okay

954
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,440
i will send the rest of my comments via

955
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,040
list but i wanted to make sure i

956
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,280
understood that thank you sounds good

957
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,040
thank you sir

958
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,160
thank you

959
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,200
next speaker okay

960
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,319
um hello everyone so this is um domain

961
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,319
path for ethernet vpn interconnect

962
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,400
networks draft

963
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,200
next one please

964
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,040
so this is the agenda we can go to the

965
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,280
next one so basically

966
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,040
this draft

967
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,960
is about

968
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,040
taking the domain path attribute that is

969
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,000
defined in the evpn ipvpn interworking

970
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,119
draft

971
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,640
and use it also for evpn layer 2

972
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,760
routes

973
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,240
so a short refresh about the

974
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,720
the route is basically what you have on

975
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,079
on the slide

976
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:42,880
so

977
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,319
domain path is an optional transitive uh

978
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,319
attribute it's composed of a sequence of

979
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,000
domain segments

980
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,480
where each domain is defined by a length

981
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,800
and a sequence of domains

982
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,280
you see here the format of a given

983
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,319
domain

984
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,880
including the domain id and the safy

985
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,839
type

986
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,880
where the staff type can be evpn ip vpn

987
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,359
ip or zero for local routes

988
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,280
so the the whole idea is

989
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,800
in the ip vpn vpn networking draft at

990
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,440
each service gateway with an ipverv

991
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,400
connecting two domains can actually add

992
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,480
or append a new domain

993
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,040
for the routes that are the the gateways

994
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,280
are re-advertising to the destination

995
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,560
domain

996
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,599
and the d-pad has uh impacts on uh you

997
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,119
know the control plane loop protection

998
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,800
as well as uh the best path selection

999
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,680
next slide please

1000
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,280
so here you have uh two examples um the

1001
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,880
use case one is basically you have a

1002
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,359
bunch of gateways that are

1003
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,520
interconnecting different

1004
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,960
domains

1005
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,040
so p4 originates a route and route i5 it

1006
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,160
goes to p3 p3 installs that into into

1007
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,640
the ipv verv and we advertise that into

1008
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,440
a second domain in an

1009
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,400
and route

1010
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,880
and when it does that it slaps a d path

1011
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,040
with a with domain 6500 uh column one uh

1012
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,800
colony vpn

1013
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,359
and so on and so forth for the gateways

1014
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,200
pe2 and an evp and p1 so the idea is if

1015
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,640
p1 and p4 they have a backdoor

1016
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,880
connection or a peering

1017
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,920
and p1 re-advertises the route back to

1018
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,400
p4 p4 can actually

1019
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,680
uh

1020
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,359
recognize the uh

1021
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,240
one of the local domain ids as a

1022
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,119
his own uh local domain and can actually

1023
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,640
prevent uh

1024
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,760
you know

1025
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,440
re-advertising back the route so

1026
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,520
basically it drops the route

1027
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,079
a more uh you know simpler case is the

1028
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,240
use case two which is a typical data

1029
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,400
center gateway loop protection

1030
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,480
uh where you know you have a p1

1031
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,359
advertising an evp and route type 5 to

1032
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,680
gateways one and two and they exchange

1033
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,240
the routes in an ipvpn

1034
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,640
address family and they

1035
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,880
because of the uh you know the domain

1036
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,040
path they can actually identify a

1037
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,760
potential loop and they do not uh

1038
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,040
re-advertise

1039
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,760
the role back to the evpn domain

1040
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,480
next one please

1041
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,400
[Music]

1042
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,880
so uh what we are doing here in this

1043
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,520
draft is use the d-path for

1044
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,000
non-intersecting forwarding evpn routes

1045
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,960
in particular you have here the

1046
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,960
some details for the mac ip

1047
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,200
advertisement routes

1048
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,880
when those routes are not used for

1049
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,880
intersection forwarding

1050
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,200
and here basically

1051
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,000
we are not connecting like uh domains as

1052
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,240
uh defined in the avp and ipdp and

1053
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,760
interworking draft but what we are

1054
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,359
interconnecting here is layer two

1055
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:52,640
domains

1056
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,839
and the layer two evpn gateways between

1057
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,560
the domains are actually modifying the d

1058
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,079
path

1059
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,119
and

1060
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,000
here we also use the safety type is

1061
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,359
going to be always 70 so evpn

1062
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,760
but other than that the gateways will

1063
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,040
will use similar procedures and uh the

1064
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,599
use cases are um typically the

1065
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:19,599
rfc9014 interconnect gateways

1066
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:20,880
and we can

1067
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,960
reuse this attribute to detect the loops

1068
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,559
uh you know in a very simple way

1069
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,800
and because of the uh

1070
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,480
capabilities of this attribute we can

1071
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,720
also use it for route traceability or

1072
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,720
best path selection

1073
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,319
um a special attention to section 4 and

1074
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,800
0.2 in the draft that summarizes the

1075
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,720
current best path selection for mac ip

1076
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,079
routes in general

1077
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,880
so i should be looked at with you know

1078
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,839
in a careful manner next one

1079
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:54,559
please yeah so i have two examples that

1080
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,520
we have in the draft here uh

1081
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,440
a very simple one you have data center

1082
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,280
gateway one and two it's a for an evpn

1083
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,520
rfc

1084
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,119
9414 sorry nine zero one four

1085
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,319
interconnect

1086
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,960
so a mac route uh makes it to data

1087
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,520
center one uh one and two uh which you

1088
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,839
know uh we advertise that into another

1089
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:16,800
domain

1090
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,640
and because of this attribute we can

1091
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,400
protect the

1092
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,559
loop if you go to the next

1093
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,119
next slide

1094
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,279
we have another example

1095
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,040
yeah next next one please

1096
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,400
isn't it the seven

1097
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,079
which slide do you want is it seven yeah

1098
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,800
yeah this this one yeah sorry yeah

1099
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,599
it took a while for my screen yes sorry

1100
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,079
yeah here is a similar example but now

1101
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:51,680
in data center gateway 2 you have a

1102
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,960
local uh attachment circuit and uh

1103
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,880
an se connected to it

1104
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,839
so you advertise that macro out uh with

1105
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,960
you know a special local domain

1106
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,160
id

1107
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,760
and uh you

1108
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,599
you know the data center gateway one you

1109
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,000
receive both if you configure the same

1110
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,800
domain id for local routes on both uh

1111
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,119
data gateway one can actually drop the

1112
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,520
those routes immediately

1113
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,160
uh another way of doing it is even if

1114
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,760
there isn't a gateway one and two they

1115
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,839
do not share the

1116
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,160
local routes domain id

1117
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,359
you still

1118
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:28,400
prevent

1119
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,520
routes because uh let's say data

1120
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,680
they would one for instance uh selects

1121
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,880
the the one coming uh from domain one

1122
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,720
it'll re-advertise

1123
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,839
to domain two but now uh you know

1124
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,960
appending uh the new domain id so

1125
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,480
the route

1126
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,440
that is

1127
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,720
advertised into domain 2 will have

1128
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,800
domain id 1 column 1 evpn comma

1129
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,200
1.3 column 0.

1130
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,160
and that can be used uh first of all on

1131
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,720
the p or data center gateway uh to

1132
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,280
identify that this is coming from you

1133
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,520
know it's potentially a loop so data

1134
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,880
center gateway two is not going to

1135
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,119
advertise that into domain one

1136
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,079
and also evpn p2 can take that into the

1137
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,599
best path selection

1138
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,480
and use the one that was pre previously

1139
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,880
advertised by data center gateway 2

1140
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,160
directly

1141
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,200
so

1142
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,079
basically the forwarding will be uh

1143
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:27,920
properly done

1144
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,720
next slide please

1145
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,280
yeah and this is pretty much it so uh

1146
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,920
this is first you know version zero zero

1147
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,839
so we are looking for

1148
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:42,480
feedback so any any questions or

1149
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,760
feedback are

1150
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,160
welcome

1151
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,960
okay no question i think we can move to

1152
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,160
the next ali

1153
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,760
go ahead aliana and mute yourself

1154
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,160
please hear me okay yeah uh hurry thanks

1155
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,559
for the appraisal uh so

1156
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,720
uh quick question um

1157
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,559
so basically this is uh enhancing

1158
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:20,319
the procedure in rfc 9104

1159
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,400
uh for the uh

1160
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,599
uh to connect two domains uh

1161
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,839
where it is cover over there in here we

1162
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:31,200
can uh expand it to multi beyond two

1163
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,319
domains

1164
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:35,359
uh to do loop prevention as well as uh

1165
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,079
beta selection

1166
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,079
that is correct yeah it's extending the

1167
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,400
procedure c9014

1168
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,720
yeah okay very good thanks

1169
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,960
thank you

1170
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,119
okay so jorge you are also the next

1171
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,119
speaker let me

1172
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,359
change the slides about ip aliasing

1173
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,280
yeah okay

1174
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,559
so um

1175
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,520
yeah this is the version zero three so

1176
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,839
can you go to the next next slide please

1177
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,160
yeah so um so in

1178
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,760
revision02 was presented in the last

1179
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,480
ietf and we were talking about three

1180
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,839
different use cases for ipa

1181
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:18,400
aliasing

1182
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,599
so one was four ethernet segments for

1183
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,400
host routes in symmetric irb a second

1184
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,640
use case for interface less

1185
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,079
and host routes

1186
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,960
and the third use cases for ip prefix

1187
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,200
routes when the ethernet segment is a

1188
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,960
layer 3 construct

1189
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,480
so in

1190
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,079
in version 3

1191
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,400
basically we added an example for use

1192
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,680
case 2.

1193
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,079
uh there was some feedback in the main

1194
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,280
list that triggered some clarifications

1195
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,559
as well

1196
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,599
in particular about the ethernet segment

1197
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:54,480
when it's used as a layer 3 construct

1198
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,040
which is a which is a new concept

1199
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,440
and we also added a section

1200
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,160
uh which talk talks about the

1201
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,160
compatibility of ip aliasing and the

1202
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,520
unequaled acmp draft

1203
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,640
uh next slide please

1204
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,680
so uh yeah one of the points is the how

1205
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,400
you

1206
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,559
construct this layer three ethernet

1207
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:17,760
segment

1208
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,559
and

1209
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,800
the idea was that for this use case

1210
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,359
three uh basically the ethernet section

1211
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,359
is really defined as a set of layer

1212
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:26,880
three links

1213
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,760
that are connecting the uh multi-home

1214
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,119
leaves into the the same ce

1215
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,200
the esi in this case should be a type

1216
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,559
four uh

1217
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:39,920
using the router id of the multi-home se

1218
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,599
for the uh for the esi

1219
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,319
we can also run df election if uh we

1220
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,240
have single active there is no need for

1221
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,720
it in all active but in single active

1222
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,440
yeah it's a it's an option here

1223
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,400
and uh and then with that all the pec

1224
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,520
routes that we received uh receive on

1225
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,960
the ces uh with the the loopback as the

1226
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,559
next hop

1227
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,559
i mean the loopback that is defined uh

1228
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,040
for this ethernet segment um if it is

1229
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,800
received as a

1230
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,440
nexup the re-advertised

1231
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,880
routes type 5

1232
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,800
will use the associated ethernet segment

1233
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,440
identifier

1234
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,240
next slide please

1235
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,319
so uh yeah so the draft is it's been

1236
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:27,760
around for

1237
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,400
uh quite a bit and uh

1238
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,880
i think we we addressed uh all the

1239
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,040
different comments uh and you know and

1240
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,079
feedback

1241
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,960
so we believe the uh yeah is definitely

1242
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,040
ready for a working group adoption

1243
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:50,920
any question

1244
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:58,640
okay no question we will move to the

1245
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,000
next speaker

1246
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
jeffrey

1247
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,280
i'd like to

1248
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,280
share the screen myself because i have

1249
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,920
some animations to help show things

1250
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,760
sure let me stop sharing

1251
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,000
go ahead

1252
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,960
um so uh what i'm

1253
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:49,839
oops i'm sorry hold on a second

1254
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,440
um

1255
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,040
i think i'm going to uh

1256
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,839
to

1257
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:05,760
i

1258
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,760
i'm going to have to ask here to share

1259
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,520
i'm sorry

1260
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,319
okay

1261
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:13,680
i have some settings uh not fixed i

1262
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,240
tried it earlier right okay

1263
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,520
uh mvp and regional segmentation next up

1264
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,319
next slide please

1265
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,960
so let me start with the background uh

1266
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,160
we have rfc 7524

1267
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,280
which is about mvpn vpos

1268
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,839
inter area segmentation

1269
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,040
basically

1270
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,119
a provider tunnel

1271
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,960
from p to p

1272
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,520
consists of intra area segments of

1273
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,240
different types or instances for example

1274
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,680
you can they have a mlg tunnel in

1275
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,200
area one and but uh rcp the p20

1276
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,280
tunneling area too

1277
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,359
the way it works is that area border

1278
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:03,440
routers they

1279
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,760
they work as a route reflectors they

1280
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,319
modify the tunnel type and

1281
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,359
identification uh in the

1282
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,359
pins a tunnel attributes

1283
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:15,200
that is attached to the

1284
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,319
pins a.d routes

1285
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:20,480
when they re-advertise the routes to the

1286
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,400
next area

1287
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,359
they also update a community

1288
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,160
it is called segmented next hub extended

1289
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,119
community it's basically um

1290
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:33,520
another uh

1291
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,960
protocol desktop

1292
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,960
embedded in the in the in the message in

1293
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,359
a bgp update so that's um when the uh

1294
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:43,440
pes uh

1295
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,200
send back when they need to send back

1296
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,079
leave 80 routes they will send back to

1297
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,440
the

1298
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,960
router identified in this community

1299
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,400
um

1300
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,680
now that is limited to the inter area

1301
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,400
case and also

1302
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,440
limited to lsps um

1303
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,200
both these

1304
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,839
limitations can be removed

1305
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:10,480
and this is what this draft is about

1306
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,280
next time please

1307
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,040
so um to remove this

1308
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,400
area uh uh limitation we introduce this

1309
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,480
concept concept region

1310
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,200
so

1311
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,440
even if you have a

1312
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,520
provider network is a

1313
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,640
single area flat topology you can still

1314
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,480
still define regions

1315
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,559
um

1316
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:40,799
actually before we get to the regions we

1317
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:42,640
can first talk about how even in the

1318
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:47,119
intel area case how it can be be done

1319
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:49,280
for inter area

1320
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,520
to modify that uh

1321
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,000
pnz tunnel attribute and that extended

1322
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,119
community

1323
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,359
typically we we have a bgp neighbor

1324
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:58,319
group

1325
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,880
so that all peers in that same group

1326
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,559
will get the same

1327
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:03,520
uh

1328
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,640
pta and and that's segmented next hop

1329
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,319
extended community

1330
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:10,640
because of this pgp neighbor group

1331
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,480
we can

1332
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,880
we can allow the segmentation at the

1333
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,200
regional border routers

1334
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,480
a region

1335
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,799
can be arbitrarily defined because of

1336
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:23,599
that bgp neighbor group it could be igp

1337
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:24,960
sub area

1338
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,799
it could be a entire as plus uh some

1339
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,880
external links or it could you can

1340
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,559
so to do the inter-region segmentation

1341
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,440
and enter instead of inter area we

1342
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,280
actually don't need a signal a new

1343
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,799
signaling

1344
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:47,040
and this concept is already adopted in

1345
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,480
the

1346
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,640
evpn bound procedure of this uh spec

1347
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,118
next slide please

1348
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,400
um

1349
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,960
so that's the inter region um

1350
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,400
segmentation

1351
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,280
now

1352
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,599
the next one is uh we can actually

1353
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,880
extend it to intro region uh so that we

1354
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,040
can do essentially replication

1355
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,839
um here is an example

1356
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:18,960
um

1357
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,079
it's too bad i cannot use animation here

1358
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:25,280
but we have three areas uh

1359
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,920
those three three blue uh clouds there

1360
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,440
uh the first uh uh area or first region

1361
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,040
is uh

1362
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,240
is enlarged to show where the uh focus

1363
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,119
is

1364
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:40,839
we have pe1 as the source pe and we have

1365
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:44,640
a a few other pes in the same region

1366
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,599
and then then we have some others in the

1367
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:50,160
other regions on the right side

1368
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,520
what happens is that when the p1

1369
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:58,000
advertise the pinzi route it gets uh

1370
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,440
re-advertised by the first uh uh

1371
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,920
uh border router there

1372
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,160
uh when when

1373
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,960
for inter inter region well when

1374
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,280
when the border rod reader prizes

1375
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,240
it updates the uh panel attributes

1376
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,240
and but when it

1377
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,680
when we

1378
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,760
read the prize to to the scene into the

1379
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,200
same region

1380
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,079
those are not modified

1381
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:26,319
now in case ingress replication what

1382
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:28,400
happens is that

1383
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,079
all the pes in the same region will send

1384
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:34,400
back a leaflet route

1385
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,040
directly to the source pe

1386
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,720
and then

1387
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,760
the source pe tracks those leaves

1388
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,720
and

1389
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,640
and then what do we ingress replication

1390
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,559
to all of them

1391
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:47,359
now

1392
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:49,119
if if we in

1393
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,920
extend the intro reach the inter region

1394
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,319
segmentation to infrared region as well

1395
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:55,839
basically when the

1396
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,319
when the first abr

1397
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:01,359
rbr are

1398
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,760
re-advertised uh

1399
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,240
in back into the same region it also

1400
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,799
modifies the tunnel attributes

1401
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:09,599
then

1402
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,119
you you get a

1403
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,559
a in intra region

1404
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,039
segmentation and which achieves a

1405
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:19,039
associated replication

1406
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,839
next slide please

1407
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,880
so this is a show this shows that when

1408
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:27,760
the

1409
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,359
sp1 which is stands for uh

1410
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:34,319
a segment point segmentation point as

1411
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:36,240
the it is the

1412
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,079
reasonable order router there

1413
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,920
it re-advertises

1414
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,440
always a modified tunnel attribute or

1415
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,520
and the extended community

1416
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,880
that way the

1417
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:47,599
the

1418
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,280
source pes

1419
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,760
uh the the pe is in the

1420
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,039
first region

1421
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,599
will send the leaf 80 route back to uh

1422
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:58,880
sp1 instead of pe one and because of

1423
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,680
that now the p1 will only send traffic

1424
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,400
to sp1 who will then

1425
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,599
relate the traffic to both uh ps in the

1426
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:10,000
same source region and the next in the

1427
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,680
next region

1428
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:15,879
that's something next slide please

1429
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,240
um another

1430
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,400
uh issue here is the butt node support

1431
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,440
so

1432
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,160
here the segmentation point

1433
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,160
the stitches the upstream segments or

1434
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,680
downstream segments this is done by a

1435
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,520
label swapping

1436
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,359
um but it could also have local

1437
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:38,720
receivers

1438
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,799
and that needs to do ip forwarding

1439
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:44,720
um the implementation

1440
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,200
typically can replicate the incoming

1441
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,400
package for both label swapping to

1442
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,799
downstream segments and for ipv4 and

1443
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:54,319
local vrs

1444
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,160
but sometimes

1445
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,920
a particular implementation may not be

1446
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,400
able to do that yeah

1447
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,720
it's just because an imitation of that

1448
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:07,359
device so it needs one extra copy

1449
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:10,319
so one copy for label swapping another

1450
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:14,799
copy for ip40 next slide please

1451
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:20,160
so um this uh uh is about optional

1452
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,480
procedure or for a banner to request an

1453
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,440
extra copy for local ip4

1454
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,240
in the context of

1455
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,359
the

1456
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:33,520
segmentation

1457
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,440
this optional is only accommodate

1458
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,559
certain bundles with with the limitation

1459
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,839
now if the upstream and panel segment is

1460
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:44,240
uh rcp to np

1461
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,119
then

1462
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:48,079
the rcpp don't be signaling can actually

1463
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:50,799
request the upstream p-hop nodes

1464
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,799
uh which could be a

1465
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,640
which is a p router

1466
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,880
to send x the extra copy nothing else

1467
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,880
needs to be done but if the austrian

1468
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,119
timer is increased replication or beer

1469
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:04,640
or mldp then that extra copy needs to be

1470
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,440
tunneled directly from upstream

1471
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,160
pe or rbr

1472
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,760
it cannot be done by a core router

1473
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,240
so this request is sent by

1474
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,160
um

1475
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,400
by a tunnel encapsulation attributes in

1476
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,590
the leaf id routes um

1477
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:25,440
[Music]

1478
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,599
i'll leave the details for to the

1479
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:31,839
strapped next next slide please

1480
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,359
um so summary is that um the inter area

1481
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:40,319
segmentation is extended to both inter

1482
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:42,799
region and intro region

1483
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:45,839
this does not require a a new signaling

1484
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:48,839
it's just that for intra region case

1485
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:51,839
um the every border router needs to

1486
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:53,599
update the

1487
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,200
panel attributes

1488
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,359
and the extended community next topic

1489
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:59,039
extended community

1490
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,880
for introducing purpose

1491
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,799
and then it allows a bundle to request

1492
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:04,400
the extra copy

1493
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,359
and

1494
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:08,400
for local forwarding

1495
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,000
this is a zero version of the drafts um

1496
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,960
i appreciate comments um

1497
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:19,640
that's my presentation for this one

1498
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:25,520
ali go ahead with your questions but uh

1499
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:26,880
really quick

1500
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,920
uh sure uh jeffrey thanks for the prison

1501
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,640
quick question uh

1502
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,400
in your presentation

1503
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,000
you didn't cover the redundancy

1504
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,400
when we got multiple

1505
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,680
uh

1506
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,960
gateways for the enter into our region

1507
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,200
is your draft covers you know

1508
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,440
the redundancy and the df election

1509
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,359
aspects of it

1510
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:54,319
the redundancy is already covered by

1511
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:57,920
even by the original rfc 25

1512
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:03,520
7524 is because that the leafy routes uh

1513
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,400
the egress pe will only pick one

1514
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,200
uh

1515
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,920
segmentation point as upstream so and

1516
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,839
send the levy route towards that one

1517
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:17,039
so you will not get uh duplicate traffic

1518
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:20,000
uh so you might want to put a short note

1519
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,880
or a short section in this trash

1520
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,079
sure

1521
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:25,359
all right

1522
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:26,839
thank you

1523
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:30,558
thanks okay

1524
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,599
so you can go ahead jeffrey with your

1525
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:35,200
next presentation

1526
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,880
okay thanks so this draft is about

1527
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,280
having a controller

1528
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,400
using mvp and evpn for provider tunnel

1529
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,200
discovery um presenting

1530
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:50,079
on behalf of my co-authors rishabh sandy

1531
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:51,359
and human

1532
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,839
this is actually a draft that is two

1533
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:55,520
years old

1534
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:59,119
i uh we pres we published that but uh i

1535
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:01,039
actually didn't present it for a while

1536
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:02,960
um and i think

1537
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,720
it's time to

1538
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,160
to try to

1539
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,839
move this forward

1540
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:11,119
next slide please

1541
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:12,799
so let me first

1542
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:14,640
summarize the uh

1543
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,560
potential usage of a controller in an

1544
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,198
mvp and event network

1545
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:21,040
the first one is that

1546
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,000
is the calculation and the signaling of

1547
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,920
the provider tunnels

1548
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,359
um

1549
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,600
it

1550
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:32,960
this is uh uh covered by two drafts the

1551
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,600
first draft is basically how to set up

1552
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,238
p2mp srp2mp

1553
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:39,839
panels uh

1554
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:42,399
in the underlay and the second draft is

1555
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:46,000
the mvpn evpn sr p10p

1556
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,399
always talks about that ingress pe

1557
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,479
collects the

1558
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:52,080
tree information the provider tunnel

1559
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,439
information

1560
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:55,600
and which includes root information

1561
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,600
leaves and constraints and then pass on

1562
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,520
to controllers for calculation and

1563
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,960
signaling

1564
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,439
the next usage of

1565
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,399
the controller is that

1566
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:10,560
it the controller can actually directly

1567
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,600
set up

1568
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,238
overlay forwarding state on pes

1569
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:14,960
which

1570
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,158
can

1571
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:17,279
completely

1572
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,839
remove the needs for an ap

1573
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:22,238
signaling protocol

1574
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:24,000
presumably the similar could be done for

1575
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,560
year vpn and bomb traffic

1576
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,439
but i i had not talked about the in that

1577
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:30,560
draft yet

1578
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,000
um

1579
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,359
so that is covered uh as in in the bgp

1580
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,600
multicast controller uh draft which

1581
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,759
covers art things as well

1582
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,839
and finally the controller could

1583
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:44,960
actually participate uh in the mvp um

1584
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,080
signaling to collect a signal provider

1585
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,399
tunnel information at the overlay

1586
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:53,520
um that way we do not need the ingress

1587
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,640
pe to first collect the tree information

1588
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,560
which include leaf information and then

1589
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,719
password pass on the controller the

1590
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:03,679
controller will just do its uh

1591
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:05,520
collect the information itself

1592
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,840
and that is what this presentation is

1593
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:08,880
about

1594
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,600
next slide please

1595
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,040
some quick backgrounds for the tree and

1596
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,880
leaf discovery

1597
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,840
this term pmz provider multicast service

1598
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,640
interface is always a

1599
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,679
tricky term but it's basically a

1600
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:29,600
logical interface used by pe to send uh

1601
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,640
overlay data uh to some or

1602
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,640
or all the pes

1603
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,880
um you could have inclusive pinzo

1604
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,040
selected pnz and we have corresponding

1605
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,159
av routes that announces tunnel that

1606
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:45,440
used to instantiate that pinside

1607
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,440
uh we talked about that ingress pe

1608
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,320
advertise ipad routes

1609
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,320
and then they may track leaves

1610
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,719
explicitly and based on the trapped

1611
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:57,360
leaves the ingress pe will

1612
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,600
trigger tunnel setup

1613
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,800
in the old days if you use rcpt piton b

1614
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,760
tunnel the ingress pe will ask the rcp

1615
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,480
module to set up the tunnel

1616
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,800
in the controller case

1617
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,239
the ingress pe passed the tree

1618
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:14,239
information to the controller to

1619
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:18,640
calculate and set up that srp23

1620
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,360
next slide please

1621
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,840
now

1622
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:28,320
um the basic idea of the the main topics

1623
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:31,040
for this uh draft is that uh

1624
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,960
the controller will do the tree and

1625
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,600
leave discovery uh by participating in

1626
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,800
the mp mvpn evpn

1627
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,040
signaling

1628
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,679
to collect the tree information

1629
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:44,480
um

1630
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,360
here if you look at the picture on the

1631
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:51,280
right side i have numbered uh those

1632
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,640
routes um

1633
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:55,520
this basically indicate the

1634
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,640
the sequence of the events uh or which

1635
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,199
corresponds to the animation

1636
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:04,400
now the first step is i'm using the spnz

1637
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,120
example p1

1638
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,159
advertise spg routes and the controller

1639
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:14,400
is participating in the uh uh signaling

1640
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,360
so the controller gets that spg route it

1641
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,159
knows that oh okay for this spg i'm

1642
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:23,520
using this uh provider tunnel with the

1643
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,000
root id and tree id that

1644
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,760
ingress pe gave

1645
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,640
and then it re-advertises

1646
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,800
to other pe's

1647
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,480
in step two

1648
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:38,320
now pe2 and p3 gets that sp in z route

1649
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,440
send the leaf 80 route back um

1650
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,520
targeted at the controller

1651
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,159
so now the controller knows that the p2

1652
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:49,040
and p3 are the leads so it has the

1653
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,640
entire information

1654
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,880
uh the tree id um

1655
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,400
the leaf sets

1656
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,040
so they can set up the tree using the

1657
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,800
controller to three nodes the signal

1658
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,000
name

1659
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,080
um now for the p uh egress p to uh

1660
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,080
direct the leaflet route to the

1661
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,360
controller

1662
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,480
um

1663
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,239
then the ingress pe will attach the

1664
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:12,960
extended community to the pinz route

1665
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,640
that basic encodes the

1666
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,159
controller's address

1667
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:18,960
so now the panel leaves will use that

1668
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,679
information to construct a raw target

1669
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:24,640
attached to the dvd route um

1670
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,360
so that it can be targeted that

1671
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,800
at the controller

1672
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,719
that's the basic idea

1673
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:33,840
next slide please

1674
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,360
um now

1675
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,840
in the previous example the ingress pe

1676
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,040
originated origin uh the initial uh

1677
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,560
pinzi route

1678
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,440
now

1679
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,880
for ingress pe to advertise the uh ping

1680
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,159
routes it typically is done

1681
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:56,800
because of the configuration

1682
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,560
and that configuration

1683
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,040
is from a central planning entity anyway

1684
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,480
ahead of time

1685
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,440
so

1686
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,280
what if we uh

1687
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,600
relieve the ingress pes from that burden

1688
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,520
of learning that configuration and

1689
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,159
advertising those uh png routes we have

1690
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:15,760
the controller

1691
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:16,800
that

1692
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,760
is pre loaded with all the information

1693
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,840
and that is planned by the central

1694
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,400
planning entity and then it will just

1695
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,040
advertise the pinsy route on the ingress

1696
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,640
pe's behalf

1697
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,640
so now you can see that in the first

1698
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,040
step the controller added has the pinzi

1699
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,000
routes

1700
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,800
um

1701
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:35,840
and then the

1702
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:38,000
other pes uh they will send back the

1703
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,199
leave 80 routes when they if they decide

1704
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,199
determine that they are then tunnel

1705
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:45,199
leaves

1706
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:47,760
um so this not only relieves the

1707
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,480
increased p the burdens of learning the

1708
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,199
configuration and

1709
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:56,640
advertise those routes it also makes

1710
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,239
the dcb label allocation easier the dcb

1711
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,400
label is um

1712
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,960
it's basically like a global like global

1713
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,560
labels or similar to the srgb labels

1714
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,120
basically all the p's will use the same

1715
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,719
label value for for vpn or for

1716
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,320
internet segments

1717
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:16,770
um

1718
01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:18,719
[Music]

1719
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:19,840
um

1720
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,199
so they are

1721
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:23,280
they need they must be allocated

1722
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,480
from the common block by a central uh

1723
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,520
entity

1724
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,440
um so that could be the controller

1725
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,760
itself so now the controller

1726
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,159
has all the information and and to

1727
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:37,040
advertise the png routes and then

1728
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,719
with the uh

1729
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:41,040
dcp label allocated from

1730
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,159
uh

1731
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:43,360
from that

1732
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,520
that block

1733
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,239
there are some special considerations uh

1734
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:52,400
uh uh when the tunnel uh segmentation

1735
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,679
is used

1736
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:56,480
next slide please

1737
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,920
so um

1738
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:05,760
in in previous case we talked about

1739
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,040
controller advertising those pz routes

1740
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,880
now

1741
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,360
in a segmentation case

1742
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,520
because we want the

1743
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,679
propagation of the pinzi rouse to follow

1744
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:19,520
a

1745
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,920
certain order to go through all the

1746
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,679
segmentation points

1747
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,400
so

1748
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,360
if we don't do anything special

1749
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,480
those routes may be propagated out of

1750
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,280
order and then we don't get the

1751
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,560
benefit of

1752
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,360
segmentation points

1753
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,040
updating those attributes we talked

1754
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,520
about in the previous presentation so in

1755
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,320
this case we need a controller to

1756
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,320
targets

1757
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:51,199
the ingress pe is first even though we

1758
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:53,920
need uh uh is advertising routes on

1759
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,000
behalf of the ingress p

1760
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,080
so the first step the controller

1761
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,960
advertised pin the router was p1

1762
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,640
and then pu1

1763
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,880
and guess it and then turn back and

1764
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,480
advertise to to everyone now this

1765
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,159
extra step

1766
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:13,080
is achieved by manipulating the raw

1767
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:16,800
targets um

1768
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,400
so um

1769
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,800
i think i'm going to uh uh skip some

1770
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,120
details here um

1771
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,679
next slide please

1772
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,880
yeah you have to conclude jeffrey we are

1773
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,719
already behind the schedule

1774
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:32,880
yeah okay yeah uh can we get the next

1775
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,320
slide

1776
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,199
um

1777
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:38,080
yeah summary yes so we talked about the

1778
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,640
uh controller advertising the

1779
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,520
uh

1780
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:44,719
let's participate in signaling

1781
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:46,960
including controller learning the panel

1782
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,960
id and new information

1783
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,679
and all advertising the png routes on

1784
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:53,520
behalf piece

1785
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,040
and that allows the

1786
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,600
tcp label allocation

1787
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,520
more easily and

1788
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,159
so that's the idea um comments

1789
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,799
appreciated

1790
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,000
yeah ali i'm sorry but we don't have any

1791
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,520
time for questions

1792
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,840
so please please

1793
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,159
all right

1794
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:20,000
thank you

1795
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,719
next picker

1796
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:29,760
hi everyone i'm yau from ct and this

1797
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,520
draft is about

1798
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,760
the issues that may be encountered

1799
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,600
during the deployment

1800
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,960
of srv6 based pgp services

1801
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,400
in the srv6 and nprs coexistence

1802
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,600
scenario and the possible solutions

1803
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,400
next slide please

1804
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:52,800
and the best srv6 services draft defines

1805
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,679
how pgp messages between peas

1806
01:18:55,679 --> 01:19:00,320
may carry s36 services to 10 to form

1807
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,520
vpns

1808
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:04,880
it relevance the existing av service of

1809
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:09,520
nprs based vpn routes the srv6 service

1810
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:12,159
set is a set associated

1811
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:14,400
with the service specific endpoint

1812
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,159
behavior on pe

1813
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:19,280
this set or part of the set is enclosed

1814
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,040
in srv6

1815
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,560
service tlv

1816
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,520
within the bgp prefix

1817
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,239
in the bgb prefix set attribute

1818
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:31,600
which is attached to existing and pbgp

1819
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,600
and level files

1820
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,040
and there are two methods to encode srv6

1821
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,840
services the first method

1822
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:43,480
srv6 services are encoded as a hole in

1823
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:47,920
srv6 service theories and the mpls label

1824
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,800
field of the corresponding analyse is

1825
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,760
set to implicit now

1826
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,280
the second method the srv6 server trv

1827
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:00,239
carries only the locator part of the set

1828
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:02,719
and the function and argument part are

1829
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:04,960
encoded in the ampere's label field from

1830
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,480
the nri

1831
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,280
next slide please

1832
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:14,000
and this figure shows the coexistence

1833
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,760
scenario

1834
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,480
p1 is a legacy device that can only

1835
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,600
support

1836
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,440
nprs vpn

1837
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:26,000
on p3 an srv6 service set and the mpls

1838
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,560
vpn label are assigned for the same

1839
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,480
service service one

1840
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:34,719
and both the srv6 vpn root and nprs vpn

1841
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:38,320
root of p3 are sent to p1

1842
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:42,400
and since p1 only supports mpls vpn it

1843
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:46,320
may discard the srv6 service tle and

1844
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:50,239
treat the srv6 we can root as an nprs

1845
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:52,639
vpn route for service one

1846
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,719
then there are two

1847
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:58,400
uh mps vpn rules for the same service

1848
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:02,560
one on p1 and then on the data plan p1

1849
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,800
may choose a long route which is

1850
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:08,560
originally the srv6 space the route and

1851
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:12,400
use the label field in roi of the srv6

1852
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,760
we can route as the mpos vpn label for

1853
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,920
packet encapsulation

1854
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,280
and after p3 receives the packets it may

1855
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,760
send the packet to the loan service

1856
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,159
instance or drop the packets

1857
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:28,560
we can see from the example that

1858
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:32,080
legacy devices may only treat the srv6

1859
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,600
vpn routes as an fps vpn route

1860
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:38,239
which may result in service value or

1861
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:40,800
abnormal extra traffic flows in the

1862
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:44,880
network next like this

1863
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:52,480
to avoid this problem the uh the srv6 uh

1864
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:56,560
services draft suggested suggests that

1865
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:59,120
implementations should provide a

1866
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:02,320
mechanism to control advertisement of

1867
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:06,080
srv6 based bgp service routes on open

1868
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,560
enable and upper service basis

1869
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,719
one common way to do this is by

1870
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:12,159
configuration

1871
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:12,960
and

1872
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,679
first the network operator should obtain

1873
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:18,960
whether the keys are capable of srv6

1874
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,800
based service routes

1875
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,440
then the operator configures some key or

1876
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,080
neutral factors based on each piece

1877
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,440
capability

1878
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,239
the penable configuration specifies

1879
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:33,199
which piece can the srv6

1880
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:35,520
service routes psn 2.

1881
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,520
this method has some

1882
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,760
disadvantages especially in the

1883
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,520
large-scale networks

1884
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,840
and the neighbor configuration need to

1885
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,440
change with the device capability and

1886
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:50,000
the additional steps of getting the

1887
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,760
capability of keys and the configuration

1888
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:57,040
increase the possibility of faults

1889
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,679
and the difficulty of troubleshooting

1890
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:02,159
and since there's no standard solution

1891
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:04,480
for the network operator to obtain the

1892
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:08,239
piece capability for srv6 based service

1893
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:09,280
routes

1894
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,600
there may be interconnection problems in

1895
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:15,040
the network consisting of devices from

1896
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,280
multiple vendors

1897
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,920
next like this

1898
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:25,360
and to control the advertisement of srv6

1899
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:28,400
service rules without per never

1900
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,880
without per neighbor configuration this

1901
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,000
document

1902
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,600
uses a simple way

1903
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,639
it it defines a new

1904
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:41,360
capability code for srv6 pgp service

1905
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,560
and

1906
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,159
a bgb speaker must not send any update

1907
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:49,760
message that includes the srv6 service

1908
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:53,520
tvs on a particular bgp section unless

1909
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,719
it has sent or received the srv6 based

1910
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:59,440
bgp service capability in the open

1911
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,600
message on that session

1912
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,560
and like other b2b capabilities if the

1913
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:07,679
capability for srv6 based service rules

1914
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:11,360
is enabled or removed on the device an

1915
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:14,320
established session needs to be reset

1916
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,800
to resend the open message

1917
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,280
and in this way it is easier to

1918
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:23,440
implement and manage srv6 based services

1919
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,120
in the network

1920
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:28,320
and next slide please

1921
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,520
yeah that's all for the job thank you

1922
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:40,280
question

1923
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:47,440
okay thank you let's move to the next

1924
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,839
speaker

1925
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:52,799
pascal

1926
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,199
just defend

1927
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:59,040
can you hear me okay

1928
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,920
yeah you can do it you can do it good um

1929
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,440
can you

1930
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:06,159
next slide please

1931
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,760
so this is this is a new

1932
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,480
draft which basically discusses

1933
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,400
uh the quality of the information that's

1934
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,320
being redistributed

1935
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,960
in evpn and in particular

1936
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,520
we are trying to alert community

1937
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:22,880
uh that

1938
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,760
with ipv6 slack and the way we are

1939
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,320
snooping it today in our networks

1940
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:31,280
uh we are probably uh

1941
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,600
as we say build on build we are probably

1942
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,600
building on sale meaning that

1943
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,199
we are building a very solid

1944
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:39,520
architecture on something which is not

1945
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,520
solid at all

1946
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,719
if you think about the hcpv4 ipv4

1947
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:46,400
general we can build something solid

1948
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,639
because dhcp is stateful

1949
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:51,199
and we could we can observe the dxcp

1950
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:53,840
exchange make sure that it happens in

1951
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,360
both directions

1952
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:58,239
and and so we can reasonably well snoop

1953
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:01,040
the hcp and derive a state

1954
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,280
of which ip address is where

1955
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,360
uh with which mac address and then

1956
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:08,400
inject that in vpn or anywhere else

1957
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,560
with dhcp v6

1958
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,960
arguably we can we can get

1959
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,400
same result and have a reliable state

1960
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,840
that we can inject in the fabric now

1961
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,560
ipv6 comes in with stateless address

1962
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,199
configuration which is a major way of

1963
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:26,800
forming addresses

1964
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,280
and as opposed to the hcp slacks

1965
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,520
stateless thruster configuration is not

1966
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,600
stateful it's not deterministic you

1967
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,040
don't know

1968
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,199
when the nodes will form addresses you

1969
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:38,800
don't know how many addresses they will

1970
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,360
form you don't you have no idea when the

1971
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,000
notes release those addresses so you end

1972
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,920
up with a state which is only partially

1973
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,920
valid with regard to what the host

1974
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,159
really wants and do

1975
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:53,840
for instance there is this case that we

1976
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,440
call a silent node

1977
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:58,480
where uh we have missed or forgotten

1978
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:01,600
a broadcast like a duplicated detection

1979
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,840
that message by the host and we have not

1980
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,080
learned that the host has this address

1981
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,080
so we have forgotten it and there is no

1982
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,239
way it's going to be reformed and and

1983
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:13,520
now we we stay with a missing guy and

1984
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,960
because it's

1985
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,760
it's me saying if somebody looks him up

1986
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,600
this has to be a broadcast

1987
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:20,719
the u in

1988
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:22,239
across the fabric which is really

1989
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:25,199
something we don't want to not to have

1990
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:28,159
uh similarly when the node ceases to use

1991
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:30,159
an address and that can be very often

1992
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:32,719
not can really form uh maybe say an

1993
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:34,800
address per day and release one address

1994
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,080
per day and maintain like seven

1995
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:39,040
addresses that's quite typical uh we we

1996
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:41,440
might uh very well maintain addresses

1997
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,840
and state neural networks for addresses

1998
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,360
which don't exist so we are wasting

1999
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,400
resources

2000
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,760
as much uh for state as for bandwidth in

2001
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,520
the case of

2002
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,840
consent notes

2003
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,800
and uh there is no

2004
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,719
information in slack about uh when the

2005
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:02,560
device moves and what's the order of

2006
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,560
movement etc so even the location the

2007
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,199
latest location of a given ip address is

2008
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:08,320
uncertain

2009
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,400
and that that's just for maintaining the

2010
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,120
addresses but the fact that slack

2011
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:15,360
realizer broadcast is also

2012
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,520
opening not only to to too many

2013
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,600
broadcaster fabrics but also

2014
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,280
uh different sorts of attacks which

2015
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:24,320
which can be very harmful like uh

2016
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,080
ddos attack against addresses which

2017
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,440
don't exist and for which we have to

2018
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,839
broadcast

2019
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,440
another angle which is more like for iot

2020
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,239
is

2021
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:36,960
uh the way slack is built imposes that

2022
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:40,239
the devices defend their address like

2023
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:42,159
they can respond to now they can respond

2024
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:44,400
to an s and if they don't then an

2025
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,800
attacker can actually uh take over the

2026
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,560
address but even if they do sometimes

2027
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,960
the attacker can take over the address

2028
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:54,080
so um it's it's

2029
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:55,920
the end result is when you want to

2030
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:59,199
deploy a solid vpn network based on on

2031
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:01,600
this kind of unreliable undeterministic

2032
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,000
information about the address is your

2033
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,320
you're bound to to face problems in the

2034
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,800
field in a lab it will work fine

2035
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,639
and then someday in the field you will

2036
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:12,960
have those very hard to to develop

2037
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,120
situations which are really due to the

2038
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,040
fact that you don't have a real stateful

2039
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,880
information about the address

2040
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,560
and it's much appearing next slide

2041
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:23,560
please

2042
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:25,760
stephen

2043
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,560
yeah um so this is just a reminder of

2044
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,440
what i just said slack is prone to to

2045
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,719
attacks

2046
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:33,920
um

2047
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,000
we can have band flows just because of

2048
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,120
of

2049
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,760
silent nodes which can exist and they do

2050
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:43,360
um snooping only observes a portion of

2051
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:46,239
the messages as no concept of order so

2052
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:48,560
we don't know for sure

2053
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,320
where the last location of this address

2054
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:53,120
is and if it's still in use at all next

2055
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,440
slide

2056
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,400
now the the atf has has

2057
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,400
come up you know in it started in

2058
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:03,360
cyclopaedia working for iot because

2059
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:06,320
really iot cannot have broadcast just

2060
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,639
the way even fabric scale

2061
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:10,400
so there was there was no way to accept

2062
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,120
all those broadcasts and um the iut

2063
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,960
finally after trying

2064
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,760
went for a stateful approach for auto

2065
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,040
configuration

2066
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:22,320
and that's rca 505 which defines a

2067
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:25,040
mechanism whereby the host talks to the

2068
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,080
router

2069
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,320
and agrees with the router that is going

2070
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,920
to have this address

2071
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,080
and this address mac mapping and there

2072
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,719
will be a lifetime there will be a

2073
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:37,679
unique idea associated to to this

2074
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:40,000
meaning that uh with the other rfc that

2075
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,960
you see here eight nine two eight we can

2076
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,639
actually check

2077
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:46,239
when the address shows up somewhere else

2078
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:48,800
in the network that it is the actual

2079
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:52,159
user owner of the address so after sudan

2080
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:54,400
if you start deploying in 505 and then

2081
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,159
928

2082
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,000
there cannot be

2083
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,840
a not rise in your tables that is not

2084
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:02,000
effectively news you're not missing any

2085
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,440
address because you have an effective

2086
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,440
state for each of them

2087
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,679
and the networks cannot be stolen and

2088
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:09,520
because you know every damn address in

2089
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:10,880
your network

2090
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,639
if there is a ddos attack against

2091
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:14,239
address which don't exist this can

2092
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:17,040
indeed else well that one will just fall

2093
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:20,400
into uh the

2094
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,440
null zero basically

2095
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:26,239
so this brings two things a state for

2096
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:28,000
reliable state for each and every

2097
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,120
address

2098
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:31,679
and a secure that's what you find

2099
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:34,560
secured in in the title of this draft a

2100
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:37,840
secure knowledge that the

2101
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:40,080
the guy for whom you we inject an

2102
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,400
address in vpn is actually the owner of

2103
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:43,600
this address

2104
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,520
and we can do savvy we can filter you

2105
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,679
know traffic that comes from a guy who

2106
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:49,440
is impersonating somebody else because

2107
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,760
we know for sure where the owner of this

2108
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,639
address is next slide

2109
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:57,679
you have less than four million

2110
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,360
that's okay i don't have many many

2111
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,320
slides

2112
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,239
um so basically this is summary of what

2113
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:04,880
i just said uh this is how the the

2114
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,040
interaction happens starting from bottom

2115
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,800
right and not auto configure whichever

2116
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,360
ipv6 address it wants but instead of

2117
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,199
doing that waiting one second extra

2118
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:15,360
involving a broadcast it just tells the

2119
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,760
router mr router please uh can i have

2120
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,920
this address the router checks step

2121
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,040
three based on policy bla uh if this guy

2122
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,440
cannot decentralize it goes through the

2123
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:28,000
distributed database which is a vpn

2124
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,159
whether this address already exists and

2125
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:32,639
because we have parameters we we know if

2126
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:34,320
it's if this address already exists if

2127
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,800
it's the same owner and it has moved uh

2128
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,040
if this is the most recent position or

2129
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,719
if it's if it's a different under in

2130
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:42,239
which case it's duplicated we have to

2131
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:44,239
reject so we have all this information

2132
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:46,239
available without doing anything on the

2133
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:49,839
network next slide please

2134
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:52,719
so

2135
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:54,639
this is more detail

2136
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:56,560
than um

2137
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,480
the previous slide about uh how stateful

2138
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,000
address configuration works but

2139
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,600
basically that there's always an

2140
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,120
abstract registrar

2141
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,199
a whiteboard where we list every address

2142
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:07,920
every mapping and as it goes the vpn is

2143
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,560
a perfect example of of how this it can

2144
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:13,760
be operated as a distributed database

2145
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:16,239
next slide

2146
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,320
you could think less that's the the

2147
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,400
centralized variation of that

2148
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,760
so this this draft is about

2149
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,159
redistributing it 505 and that's 928

2150
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:28,320
into evpl

2151
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,440
um

2152
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,120
we we can

2153
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:31,840
do

2154
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,600
um

2155
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,239
we we basically as i said distribute the

2156
01:33:36,239 --> 01:33:37,120
the

2157
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:39,679
sixth the registrar and which is called

2158
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:43,120
six lvr and it is now in every p next to

2159
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,040
the vgp table

2160
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,400
um

2161
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,800
we have this uni direct interaction with

2162
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:51,280
the host and we we have to modify the

2163
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:53,760
mac mobility excellent community and we

2164
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:56,080
provide uh backward compatibility with

2165
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:58,480
the existing operation and with the

2166
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:01,040
modified mac mobility exam community we

2167
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,600
provide this this rover this proof of

2168
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:06,000
ownership actually the hash of it

2169
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,159
and the tid which is the sequence

2170
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:09,920
counter and based on those two

2171
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,719
information we can uh effectively

2172
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:16,480
uh discover if if when the guy shows up

2173
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:18,400
somewhere else it's the same

2174
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,000
with a fresher

2175
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,920
sequence or if it's a different in

2176
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:23,360
because in which case we can say

2177
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:24,880
duplicate without going through the

2178
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:27,120
exchanges that exist today

2179
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:30,000
and i think i'm done but next slide i

2180
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,560
think that's it yes that's it so ready

2181
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,440
for four questions

2182
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:40,639
yeah

2183
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:43,280
pascal thank you thank you for this

2184
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:45,840
um you are actually extending the mac

2185
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:49,199
mobilities in the community um however

2186
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:53,679
uh rfc 9047 defines a new extended

2187
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:56,400
community that is uh especially for arp

2188
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:00,239
and naval discovery protocol things and

2189
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:03,360
so i wonder why you didn't use that one

2190
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,040
instead of the mac mobility extender

2191
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:08,800
community seems more appropriate

2192
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,480
oh

2193
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,760
can you please

2194
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,679
put that on the mailing list or send me

2195
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:16,960
an email and we'll examine that i mean

2196
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,480
let's look at it i don't have an answer

2197
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,239
it's just because we didn't look right

2198
01:35:20,239 --> 01:35:23,040
probably okay sure i would do that yeah

2199
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,280
okay if you could if you you know it

2200
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,800
would be very very neat if you could

2201
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,800
look at what we have

2202
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,280
uh today in this new extended community

2203
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:32,560
and

2204
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,880
propose a way to use

2205
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:37,280
the other one and how we would structure

2206
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:39,760
it that would be really appreciated

2207
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,840
okay

2208
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,280
and and think about the background

2209
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,360
compatibility what what key aspect here

2210
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:46,159
is

2211
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:47,119
uh

2212
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:50,000
once we supported five or five yeah and

2213
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,159
we face someone who does not

2214
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:54,159
uh we need to sort out who's the winner

2215
01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:56,000
and normally we say uh guys who

2216
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
supported five or five since they can

2217
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,320
prove their stuff they are the winners

2218
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:01,520
um

2219
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,520
and so so we we played with the the

2220
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:04,960
writing of the sequence in such a way

2221
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,639
that the net fight for five tier live

2222
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:08,880
sequence always is always a higher

2223
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,960
number then so that's why it's on the

2224
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:13,679
left you'll see that so so please please

2225
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:16,239
consider that when you do your proposal

2226
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:18,560
sure both both excellent communities are

2227
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:20,239
actually compatible you can use them in

2228
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:23,840
the draw type too with no issue

2229
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:26,000
we basically added a few flags just to

2230
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,440
notify for instance that we do

2231
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,520
effectively check for instance the

2232
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,360
source address validation

2233
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,760
right with this rover thing which is the

2234
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:34,719
ownership

2235
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:37,520
token uh that that is actually uh the

2236
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:40,480
rover is actually a rover and uh stuff

2237
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:43,280
like that so so we have to lose like

2238
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,760
four or five sticky bits

2239
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,280
so if you can look at all that i mean

2240
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:49,119
let's let's have emails but yes that

2241
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:51,119
would be nice thank you so much thank

2242
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:53,839
you

2243
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,360
thank you pascal

2244
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,520
next speaker

2245
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:02,520
hey

2246
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:09,840
this is a hybrid from huawei

2247
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,800
can you show the slides

2248
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,320
okay yeah

2249
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,719
this is our new job

2250
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:18,719
about the advertising spft

2251
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:21,679
discriminators in bgp

2252
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:24,880
next next please

2253
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:32,000
i don't see

2254
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,280
i don't see that

2255
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,679
through the next next page

2256
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:39,360
i moved i moved to

2257
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,719
okay perhaps there may be some problem

2258
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:46,480
with my network

2259
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,239
do you want to

2260
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:51,040
do you want to share on your side

2261
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,280
okay

2262
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:58,320
okay i can use my slide to see

2263
01:37:58,320 --> 01:37:59,679
you may share

2264
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:01,679
you make sure continue

2265
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:03,520
yeah for the page 2

2266
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:06,000
our motivation is that

2267
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,400
the

2268
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:11,440
rfc7880 defines the spfd mechanism

2269
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:14,000
we may use spfd to detect the pe

2270
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,159
failures quickly for direct deployment

2271
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:21,520
for spft for activity for network

2272
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:24,800
reflector when we use sid address as a

2273
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,760
duplicator so we can simply simply

2274
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:31,040
simplify operators calculation but for

2275
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:34,000
ipv6 network the determinator for each

2276
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,480
destination pe had to be remastered

2277
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,800
conflict manually

2278
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:43,280
there also two rc 7883 and 7884 define

2279
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:46,960
the easy and the odpf extension to flood

2280
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:49,119
the spfd meter

2281
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:49,840
but

2282
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:53,040
you can only use in intro to me and may

2283
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:57,280
create unnecessary spfd sessions

2284
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:00,320
page three please

2285
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:03,440
uh there are the the here is the first

2286
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:05,840
central uh the service uh for the

2287
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:08,400
service over srv6b

2288
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,199
uh there are two areas that the

2289
01:39:11,199 --> 01:39:13,440
inter-domain center row and also it may

2290
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:17,840
be also used for s for intro to make uh

2291
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:21,119
p1 p2 and advertise there are vpn roads

2292
01:39:21,119 --> 01:39:25,840
uh which contain the v6 vpnc to p3 the

2293
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,239
tropical arriving at p3 will be

2294
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:31,600
forwarded to p1 or p2 based on sr6

2295
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,440
locator reachability

2296
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:36,239
p3 needs to create the fbx session to

2297
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:38,800
detect the p1 and p2 the locator

2298
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:41,360
reachability for each

2299
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:44,320
spf session we must

2300
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:46,800
set the remote address and the

2301
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,199
discriminator

2302
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:51,678
manually

2303
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,440
when the pe

2304
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:55,840
when there is a large number of pes the

2305
01:39:55,840 --> 01:40:00,400
conclusion will be more complexable

2306
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,960
also idp may flood in the split

2307
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:05,280
discriminator but they count across the

2308
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,119
is boundary

2309
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:10,400
even even even within yes

2310
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:13,360
uh in introducing the nodes maybe create

2311
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:16,320
a redundant with redundant sprv session

2312
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:17,600
because the

2313
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:22,239
idp planning will fly into every node

2314
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:25,879
page 4 please

2315
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:38,960
for center center two uh there is a

2316
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:43,119
service over srv6 uh policy

2317
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:46,239
uh in this central is similar to the

2318
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:48,480
central one

2319
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,560
so and also it can be used for intro

2320
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:54,239
domain uh the we can also also advertise

2321
01:40:54,239 --> 01:40:58,000
uh from p1 and p2 to p3

2322
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,639
and uh but they are in this scenario

2323
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:03,280
they will use their ipv6 loopback

2324
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:05,679
address as a network the traffic

2325
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:08,320
arriving at the p3 will be folded based

2326
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:12,000
on the srv6 policy reachability and p3

2327
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,480
may be created as vip session to detect

2328
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:17,040
the p1 or p2 reachability for each

2329
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:19,119
session there we may use the remote

2330
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:22,159
heavy address donation to p1p to the

2331
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:25,360
loopback address and configure the also

2332
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:27,600
manual configure the discriminator tool

2333
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:30,159
for the svl session

2334
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:32,480
in practice in practice this scenario is

2335
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:33,199
not

2336
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:36,560
limited limited to srv6 policies and

2337
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:38,320
they also maybe

2338
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:42,320
applies to npr's general

2339
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,679
page 5 please

2340
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:51,280
uh this is our the our extension we may

2341
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:53,840
use the bb extension we may reuse the

2342
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:56,560
pft discriminator that's built which is

2343
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:59,119
that is defined in the

2344
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:01,239
what i've said

2345
01:42:01,239 --> 01:42:03,600
9026 uh

2346
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:07,760
it has defined as the type 38

2347
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:10,400
we now we introduced the two new bfd

2348
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:12,480
modes the type one is

2349
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:16,080
spld for srv6 locator session this is

2350
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:20,239
only used to detect srv6 locators and in

2351
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:23,199
this mode we may use the optional trv we

2352
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:26,560
are container as a source appear just rv

2353
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:30,400
which contains the srv6 locator address

2354
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,760
and uh

2355
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:34,960
also we may introduce another type 2 uh

2356
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,880
another type of

2357
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:40,400
vld mode means spfd for comment session

2358
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,360
in this in this type mode we may use the

2359
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:44,239
the

2360
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:47,199
user to detect a rows net hope this mode

2361
01:42:47,199 --> 01:42:50,480
can be used for both ipv4 and ipv6 the

2362
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,480
optional tov will container source ip

2363
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:55,119
address carry which contains a network

2364
01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:57,839
address

2365
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:01,440
uh page six please

2366
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:04,080
uh this is this is a proceed proceed

2367
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:06,320
procedures uh first

2368
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:08,880
photo of the advertising pdp speaker the

2369
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:11,360
vpn roads may advertise with a local

2370
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,600
designator and carried in the brd

2371
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,760
discriminator attribute then the dmd

2372
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:18,159
mode is set to one of the new modes

2373
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:19,360
defined

2374
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:21,840
for the receiving bb speaker we will use

2375
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,239
the discriminator to notify the bfd

2376
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:27,920
model to create a sblv session for mult

2377
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:30,719
type well known for known for model mode

2378
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:33,040
one the locator characters in the source

2379
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,920
address carry used as the destination of

2380
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,800
the sbi session for the model 2 the next

2381
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:41,360
hub will address carrying that source ip

2382
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:45,280
address is used as a destination

2383
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:49,280
page 7 please

2384
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,199
first

2385

i'll first i may

2386
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:56,560
thank greg's comments he gives some more

2387
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:59,760
give him give much comments before his

2388
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:00,960
meeting

2389
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:03,360
and also we will we welcome more

2390
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,679
comments and discussions and we may

2391
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:07,679
revise the chapter accordingly

2392
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:09,520
accordingly

2393
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:12,480
that's all thank you

2394
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:15,440
greg

2395
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:17,759
greg

2396
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:22,159
if we can uh go back to the previous

2397
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:24,559
slide

2398
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:27,920
um my question and

2399
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,320
i tried to express it in the comments uh

2400
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:33,199
before the meeting was

2401
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:36,639
uh it's not clear uh

2402
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:39,600
how uh dfd control messages are

2403
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,119
encapsulated

2404
01:44:41,119 --> 01:44:44,000
so are they encapsulated uh

2405
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,639
with the same as a traffic over the

2406
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:48,639
service 6 policy

2407
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:51,920
or something else

2408
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:53,280
so

2409
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:56,559
the receiving speaker

2410
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:58,560
what the

2411
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,159
network layer

2412
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:01,520
is used

2413
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:05,679
to transmit sbfd packets

2414
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:14,000
uh okay

2415
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,600
okay because i have i have uh received

2416
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:21,119
more much comments for you from you yeah

2417
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:23,840
i see that uh we may describe not very

2418
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:25,760
clear

2419
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,400
for this general we may describe it uh

2420
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:30,800
more clearly after after this meeting

2421
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:34,560
and we may update our uh our jobs

2422
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,159
okay yeah

2423
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:38,239
uh yes because um

2424
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:39,520
thank you

2425
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:43,520
yeah bfd is not uh really

2426
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:46,560
able to differentiate between

2427
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:50,080
uh the path value failure and

2428
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:52,960
the node failure of endnote

2429
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,560
so

2430
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,480
i think that that's something to be

2431
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:59,600
aware of and understand of what is

2432
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:01,440
possible to track and what you are

2433
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:04,480
really monitoring

2434
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,560
another uh

2435
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:10,639
note i want to add is that

2436
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:16,239
because of uh evpn you might find

2437
01:46:16,239 --> 01:46:19,040
that you're

2438
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:22,080
duplicating you have twice as many as

2439
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,000
bfd sessions

2440
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:29,040
as you would have if you use a bfd

2441
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:30,639
because

2442
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:34,159
if each of the pe's involved advertise

2443
01:46:34,159 --> 01:46:36,320
its own discriminator

2444
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:39,280
then other pes will start as bfd

2445
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:42,639
sessions so you are

2446
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:45,600
multiplying by two the number of bfd

2447
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,600
packets uh being

2448
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,440
in the network

2449
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,400
okay

2450
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:52,239
something to think about

2451
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:55,400
thank you

2452
01:46:56,719 --> 01:46:58,719
okay thank you for your

2453
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:02,000
comments yeah yeah yeah i just had uh

2454
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,280
thanks i i just had um a sort of generic

2455
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:07,040
comment really about where this lives

2456
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:08,960
because

2457
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:10,800
it wasn't clear to me looking at the

2458
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,239
draft if the

2459
01:47:12,239 --> 01:47:14,960
primary objective is simply

2460
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:17,760
advertising or flooding the

2461
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:21,199
the reflector discriminator in

2462
01:47:21,199 --> 01:47:24,480
um in bgp

2463
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:27,360
or if it's also

2464
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:30,239
defining these new session types

2465
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:33,280
for particular services um

2466
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:34,719
if it's simply

2467
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:36,400
the primary

2468
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:38,639
function is just to is to have a

2469
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:40,480
mechanism in bgp to flood the reflected

2470
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:42,960
discriminator similar to what we have in

2471
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:44,639
in the igps

2472
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:46,880
i'm not sure it really lives in bet

2473
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:49,040
that part of it

2474
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:50,960
um and if but secondly if you're

2475
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:53,520
defining your spft session types for

2476
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,280
particular services we also probably

2477
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:59,679
need to talk to the bfd working group

2478
01:48:00,220 --> 01:48:02,840
[Music]

2479
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:06,400
um that was it

2480
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:11,600
from different okay thank you for your

2481
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:16,520
comments yeah because this job

2482
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:22,639
hi

2483
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:24,880
sorry microphone issues uh

2484
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:27,040
jeff house is a bfd chair

2485
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,960
i i think the reason why they're

2486
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:31,119
answering matthew's comment uh had

2487
01:48:31,119 --> 01:48:32,639
originally gotten

2488
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:35,119
broached as part of a bfd attribute that

2489
01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:36,880
originally was done as part of best work

2490
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:39,520
which i suspect is why it is

2491
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,679
being brought to your original attention

2492
01:48:41,679 --> 01:48:43,280
uh we'll be taking a look at this draft

2493
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:45,600
and uh you know if it needs to move over

2494
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,360
to bfd that will be fine but we'll have

2495
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:48,480
to take a look what the scope of it

2496
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:49,520
actually is

2497
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:53,199

01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:47,800
you

2529
01:55:57,040 --> 01:55:59,199
hello

2530
01:55:59,199 --> 01:56:01,040
hello hi

2531
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:03,280
hi hey for me yeah

2532
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:05,440
yeah yeah

2533
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:09,199
uh yeah uh sorry sorry sorry man so

2534
01:56:09,199 --> 01:56:12,480
so go go go ahead but you i don't think

2535
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:14,480
you will be able to get your 10 minutes

2536
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,639
because we'll be here we will be cut at

2537
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:17,520
some time

2538
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:20,719
so please start now okay so please start

2539
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:21,520
now

2540
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:23,679
okay

2541
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:29,040
please there are i've seen

2542
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:32,800
my subject is our sub distributed bumper

2543
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:35,679
in the world user

2544
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:39,840
next feature please

2545
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:45,520
uh fixed rfc 9136 bumping the where user

2546
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:49,119
keys centralized floating is adopted for

2547
01:56:49,119 --> 01:56:51,920
intra-subnet communication that means

2548
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:55,119
our inter-subnet flow must be proceeded

2549
01:56:55,119 --> 01:56:57,760
by dc guitarist this will put in the

2550
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:02,239
dgws in order to decrease bgw pressure

2551
01:57:02,239 --> 01:57:04,719
distributed forwarding should be

2552
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:06,719
considered for intra-subnet

2553
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:08,400
communication

2554
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:11,599
especially when awes have the capability

2555
01:57:11,599 --> 01:57:14,400
of fpvr flooding

2556
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:17,440
next speech police

2557
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:19,360
ah thank you

2558
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:20,880
for example

2559
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:23,599
distributed community communication

2560
01:57:23,599 --> 01:57:24,880
between

2561
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:27,199
sn2 and i think

2562
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:29,800
i think one and the distributed

2563
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:33,119
communication between sn2 and h3 are

2564
01:57:33,119 --> 01:57:37,440
expected however mve2a and me to

2565
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:42,480
only have microwave according to fc9136

2566
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:45,599
so they have no ap routine tables

2567
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:46,400
this

2568
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:48,880
thus directly inter subnet can not be

2569
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:50,080
supported

2570
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:53,719
next page please

2571
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:01,040
we can configure our ipvf instance

2572
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:05,360
to hme in order to activate their inter

2573
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:08,080
forwarding capabilities on this species

2574
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:11,520
we can go a step further to achieve the

2575
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:14,159
distributed inter-subinator flooding

2576
01:58:14,159 --> 01:58:16,719
behavior

2577
01:58:17,119 --> 01:58:20,800
in this case the advertisement of the

2578
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:24,239
rt1 providers of esa

2579
01:58:24,239 --> 01:58:27,040
2 3 should be changed

2580
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:32,159
from rc 9136 because av-8 don't have an

2581
01:58:32,159 --> 01:58:36,400
instance of bd10 as a aileros treated in

2582
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:41,400
this figure when av2 advertises rt1 at

2583
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:45,920
av2 at 10 for bd10 and when av3

2584
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:47,440
advertise

2585
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:50,400
rt1 at av380

2586
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:52,000
for bdt

2587
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,800
these rt1 rules are both advertised

2588
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:57,360
along with an actual target

2589
01:58:57,360 --> 01:59:00,239
the extruded target is exported to the

2590
01:59:00,239 --> 01:59:01,440
target

2591
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:06,000
subliminal bd havee and hdw should be

2592
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,400
configured with that spd

2593
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:10,880
instance as a result

2594
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:12,239
that

2595
01:59:12,239 --> 01:59:14,639
extra root target these two rt1

2596
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:18,800
artillery will be imported into the spd

2597
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:22,560
by ave 8 and the dc guitarist then the

2598
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:24,719
corresponding data package can be sent

2599
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:29,199
from av-8 spd to av-3s bd3 without

2600
01:59:29,199 --> 01:59:32,239
passing through every series

2601
01:59:32,239 --> 01:59:34,719
ipvf instance

2602
01:59:34,719 --> 01:59:38,480
and next speed please

2603
01:59:40,159 --> 01:59:43,040
as illustrated in this figure multiple

2604
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:46,000
synthesized bumper in the air instances

2605
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:49,599
are integrated into the same fpf when

2606
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:53,599
ddgw1 receives a rt5 root

2607
01:59:53,599 --> 01:59:54,960
from one

2608
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:56,000
one

2609
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,040
instance acsa cannot be resolved in the

2610
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:01,679
context of another pump in the world

2611
02:00:01,679 --> 02:00:07,040
instances take the rt5 root rt5 and sn1

2612
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:10,159
for example when it is received by dw1

2613
02:00:10,159 --> 02:00:14,000
before ecs is resolved dgw one shouldn't

2614
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,719
do that acsn must be resolved in the

2615
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:21,199
context of bd10

2616
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:25,360
thus the exported target of bd10 should

2617
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:27,159
be carried along with

2618
02:00:27,159 --> 02:00:32,719
rt5 at sn1 by doing so when ddgw one

2619
02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:36,159
receives rt5 at sn1

2620
02:00:36,159 --> 02:00:39,280
dw1 can directly determine that

2621
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:45,199
rb rb1 is l3 out interface

2622
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:48,800
next speed please

2623
02:00:52,159 --> 02:00:55,599
thank you uh in such cases the rt1

2624
02:00:55,599 --> 02:01:02,800
prevails rt188 mve283 and rt1 is 3

2625
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:07,440
rt1 uh 8 ev2 820 and rt1

2626
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:11,599
me 3810 we will both be advertised for

2627
02:01:11,599 --> 02:01:15,280
the sim esl and their ethernet tag ids

2628
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:17,920
may both be 0 in case of vlan based

2629
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:19,440
service interface

2630
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:20,239
thus

2631
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:22,239
when they are both imported into the

2632
02:01:22,239 --> 02:01:25,040
same spd by av8 they can't be

2633
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:27,760
distinguished from each other in order

2634
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:30,480
to solve this problem their internet

2635
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:33,280
tech id should be set to the ecid of

2636
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:34,880
their corresponding

2637
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:38,400
attachment circulator respectively but

2638
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:42,560
in order not to interfere the mac

2639
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:44,239
forwarding of

2640
02:01:44,239 --> 02:01:45,360
btt

2641
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:47,520
we should rely

2642
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:48,840
on

2643
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:51,840
advertising two different artie roots

2644
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:53,360
for the sim

2645
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:57,119
aco the first one is advertised in pdt

2646
02:01:57,119 --> 02:02:00,560
for mac 14. the second one is advertised

2647
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:03,440
in the spd for fp forwarding only the

2648
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:05,599
secondary the internet technology should

2649
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:07,280
be set to work yeah

2650
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:08,480
could you conclude that could you

2651
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:11,199
conclude because we are out of time

2652
02:02:11,199 --> 02:02:14,639
so please just uh very few sections yes

2653
02:02:14,639 --> 02:02:16,320
yes

2654
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:18,559
i'm

2655
02:02:21,119 --> 02:02:24,639
the second one is advertised in the spd

2656
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:27,360
for fpvf4d only the second one the

2657
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:29,360
username tag id should be set to the

2658
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:31,280
acid of the

2659
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:33,920
ec1 but there are european labels should

2660
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:36,880
both be set to the european labor for

2661
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:38,719
bd10

2662
02:02:38,719 --> 02:02:42,159
and these rt5 rules should be advertised

2663
02:02:42,159 --> 02:02:45,360
allowing a new bdp external community

2664
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:47,679
named the super super limited early

2665
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:50,080
index

2666
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:54,960
because that the soa and esa or rt5

2667
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:58,560
route should both be used to do route

2668
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:01,599
resolution in the context of the spd

2669
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:05,119
such rt5 will just

2670
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:08,320
next speed please

2671
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:11,599
this is the last one

2672
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:16,480
uh yes yes i think the rt5 which is

2673
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:18,280
for example

2674
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:21,679
rt588 s1 for example it's l3 out

2675
02:03:21,679 --> 02:03:24,880
interface in the rb interface so ecsa

2676
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:27,360
must be resolved in the routing table of

2677
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:31,040
the broadcast cast domain behind that rb

2678
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:32,080
interface

2679
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:34,880
then as illustrated in the tables on the

2680
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:38,639
left side we can use the esa and soa it

2681
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:39,760
was

2682
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:43,920
at rt5 at sn1 to do recursive router

2683
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:47,040
resolution in the spd's routine table

2684
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:49,599
after the recursive router resolution

2685
02:03:49,599 --> 02:03:54,079
two rt1 prevails will be selected as rt5

2686
02:03:54,079 --> 02:03:58,000
at suv i think ones matches the first

2687
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:04,400
match is showing as rt1s and mve2 at 10.

2688
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:07,440
the second match is showing as rt1s at

2689
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:10,239
ab3 at 10. there is attention attacker

2690
02:04:10,239 --> 02:04:13,360
id of them apples the same as as

2691
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:17,360
the soa of rt5 i say 1.

2692
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:20,360
