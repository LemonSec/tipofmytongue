1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,600
i think uh jaron is going to present

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,559
about 75 25 fists

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,519
okay

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,920
thank you

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,039
so um hi everybody

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,560
uh it's

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,039
7 p.m in my

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,000
time zone and

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,720
so good evening good morning

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,359
and good afternoon depending on your

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,640
time zone and it's using tillers in

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,040
applications working group

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,879
so it's the last session of itf 10112

14
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,079
and i think we can start

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,920
so this is not well

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,719
uh i don't think it's it it's changed

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,600
since last time

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,840
and

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,199
this is a living itf code of conduct

20
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,559
it's uh

21
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,200
uh it is uh presented by request of

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,960
isg so that uh working group chairs

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,000
remind participants in the beginning of

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,280
the session

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,159
so

26
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:16,960
that

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,600
we have a code of conduct and

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,439
it's good if you follow it

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,400
so

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,360
emitting details

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,640
uh

32
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,560
useful links

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,360
and job notes and

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,000
so we need

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,479
uh bullshits are collected automatically

36
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,960
and we need uh one job describe i don't

37
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,439
think whether we need it because

38
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,520
miteco

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,360
has a chat window and

40
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,439
you can see it but

41
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,079
just just in case if anybody can

42
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,920
translate

43
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,520
messages from

44
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,399
the java or from the chat window in case

45
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,159
somebody doesn't have audio with your

46
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,399
connection it will be great and we need

47
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,160
two note checkers

48
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,200
so anybody volunteers

49
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,000
being a notetaker is a great opportunity

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,800
for new newcomers in the ihf you get to

51
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,840
learn everybody's name

52
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,518
so life that was very convincing

53
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,640
yes it's it's true

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
i see on the on the chat i think

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,120
francesca volunteered

56
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,959
all right francisco

57
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,400
this is peter i can i'm i'm

58
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,159
since i'm not speaking about uh somebody

59
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,519
personally about this i can also take

60
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,519
some notes too

61
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,400
okay

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,319
it's easy now that we have hedge doc

63
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,159
because uh you know everyone can just

64
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,879
pitch in and help

65
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,560
but still because

66
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,879
we have to have some person who who will

67
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,519
take care a veggie dog

68
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,120
okay uh

69
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,920
thank you hannes

70
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,319
okay we got honest peter this is rich

71
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,440
i'll also

72
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,480
take notes when i'm not speaking

73
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,080
okay

74
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,760
uh i've already prepared a hedge doc

75
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,159
so i think it it's

76
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,200
save you

77
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,839
some work

78
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,319
sometime

79
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,760
and so agenda for today

80
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,640
uh administrator and we have finished

81
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,080
with it

82
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,120
and then we have three presentations

83
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,080
uh each devoted to the

84
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,439
active working

85
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,200
document

86
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,319
and i think the status update

87
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,840
will be reported by

88
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,720
presenters and

89
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,798
then open mic

90
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,600
five minutes and closing

91
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,880
so animation for agenda

92
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,280
go

93
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,280
okay

94
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,560
going once

95
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,040
going twice

96
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,400
so

97
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,840
let's start with presentations

98
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,440
thank you

99
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,360
thank you church for sharing the slides

100
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,759
i'm your own shifter in not peter

101
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,880
unfortunately okay

102
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,320
i'll be presenting uh the

103
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,600
work on the new version of pcp 195 or

104
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,120
rfc 75 25 bits

105
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,759
next slide

106
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,280
so we

107
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,840
we have published two versions since the

108
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,120
previous

109
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,600
in-person meeting

110
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,320
and they

111
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,680
even though we we do have a few uh open

112
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,039
issues that

113
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,840
i'll be discussing today

114
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,160
the draft is very much

115
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,680
stabilizing

116
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,400
we managed to close most of the open

117
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,160
issues

118
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,680
and so

119
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,639
everybody on on this meeting is

120
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,000
encouraged to to read the document

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,960
and

122
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,400
seriously back to back especially

123
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,039
the section that describes

124
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,960
differences from rfc

125
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,680
7525

126
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,840
and provide feedback

127
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,199
so

128
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,720
specifically

129
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,600
uh

130
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,520
we worked on

131
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,840
airpn

132
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,960
and

133
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,560
request

134
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,800
support for some

135
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,280
application protocols that still do not

136
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,960
have a lbn defined for them

137
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,080
we added text from uh the draft

138
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,600
deprecates

139
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,600
md5 and show one a we

140
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,199
went deeply into integrity and

141
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,199
confidentiality limits

142
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,479
which are

143
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,800
described for tls 1.3 in rfc

144
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,560
8446

145
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,520
but for tls 1.2

146
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,840
uh this actually

147
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,520
required some

148
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,039
some new work

149
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,560
and i'd like to thank the authors of the

150
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,400
aad limits for their help

151
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,240
and we we added the requirement

152
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,080
for the extended muscle master secret

153
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,599
extension

154
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,840
so

155
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,520
non-trivial work but still in the big

156
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,199
scheme of things

157
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,720
um

158
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,520
relatively minor changes

159
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,800
to the

160
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,440
to the draft

161
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,400
and there are a few remaining open

162
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,440
issues

163
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,680
all of them actually uh around tls 1.2

164
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,759
so even though the rfc will cover both a

165
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,720
1.2 and one 1.3

166
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,240
and we're more conservative more careful

167
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,360
about adding requirements for 1.2

168
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,240
and so those are open issues next slide

169
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,000
um

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,039
rfc 8446 allows but doesn't but does not

171
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,479
require

172
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,000
a support of the supported versions

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,720
extension

174
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,199
we're not sure about the benefit of this

175
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,120
of this extension

176
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,800
for tls 1.2 servers and we would

177
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,639
appreciate

178
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,680
feedback from the working group

179
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,559
if

180
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,039
it does turn out that the benefit is

181
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,120
minimal

182
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,519
we would rather not

183
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,640
added

184
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,679
as a requirement even though

185
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,080
it is mentioned in 8446

186
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,800
next slide

187
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,080
uh so somewhat related to the previous

188
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,959
one

189
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,560
uh version downgraded protection

190
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,160
um and specifically um

191
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,440
games with silver hello rand the several

192
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,040
random field

193
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,519
and magic values

194
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,320
inside this field

195
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,600
this

196
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,959
appears to be relevant for the main

197
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,560
use case

198
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,680
for ephemeral cipher suites

199
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,399
and therefore we should probably

200
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,480
um require edit as a requirement to the

201
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,760
bcp

202
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
but again your feedback is a pretty

203
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,279
appreciated

204
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,839
next slide

205
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,640
rsa pss

206
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,440
so pss for

207
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,399
message signatures is already a should

208
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,160
in tls 1.2

209
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,519
but what do we do about certificates

210
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,920
and especially what do we do what do we

211
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,560
do about certificates given

212
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,200
that real world

213
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,560
certificates at least on the open web

214
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,079
are simply not using pss as far as we

215
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,440
can see

216
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,320
so

217
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,600
do we really add the requirement

218
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,160
for support of pss and support of the

219
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,560
signature algorithm cert

220
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,480
extension

221
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,320
question here

222
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,959
next slide

223
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,480
uh there's a draft in uh

224
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,640
in the tls working group

225
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,480
about obsoleting

226
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,399
key exchanges

227
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,440
it's

228
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,000
kind of stalled for for the last few

229
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,959
months

230
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,480
and we are waiting for it to mature

231
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,600
it is not adopted yet although we

232
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,560
believe

233
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,360
uh the general sentiment is to adopt it

234
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,920
into the working group

235
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,240
and we would like to be in sync with

236
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,399
this draft

237
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,839
especially

238
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,880
if it is adopted

239
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,240
and next slide

240
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,200
a question that came up i believe in itf

241
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,640
111 by mr farrell

242
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,839
uh where he asked whether we're breaking

243
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,240
consumer documents

244
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,680
um

245
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,880
so actually there's progress since this

246
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,920
slide

247
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,320
thomas and i went through the 101 rfcs

248
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,120
that

249
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,399
site

250
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,360
uh

251
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,040
rfc 75

252
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,360
75-25

253
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,720
the vast majority of them do it in a

254
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,399
very generic way either they just say

255
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,360
hey

256
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,560
here's a tls recipe and it's a good idea

257
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,200
or they said it's a should

258
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,040
or even a must

259
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,120
to support it

260
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,560
but no no specific details

261
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,320
um there are some exceptions

262
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,240
i didn't see anything of note in the uh

263
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,680
50 of them that i went through

264
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,160
and thomas might want to

265
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,200
disagree with me he read

266
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,200
the situations in the other 50

267
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,079
but

268
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,440
assuming nothing no surprise

269
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
there are

270
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,040
like formally breaking changes

271
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,680
or in other words if you're compliant

272
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,639
with 75 25

273
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,760
you may not be compliant

274
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,440
with 75 25 bits because we are adding

275
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,600
requirements but those are those apply

276
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,680
to anybody

277
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,200
who who

278
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,399
seeks to be compliant with the bcp

279
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,200
and not to any particular

280
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,519
consumers of the bcp

281
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,200
so this is

282
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,600
the way we look at it right now

283
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,040
and

284
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,480
again feedback appreciated and i believe

285
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,920
this is my last slide

286
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,399
this is peter yarrow thanks for

287
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,320
for working on that with thomas i i know

288
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,880
i didn't get to it as quickly as you did

289
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,079
um

290
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,120
i think

291
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,040
the only other point is if people have

292
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,560
uh rfcs that or other specs because

293
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,480
there's probably people outside the ietf

294
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,160
for citing this as well

295
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,480
that they are concerned about i think at

296
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,839
this point i think we've done our due

297
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,959
diligence

298
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,199
to uh you know go through the consuming

299
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,279
documents but if

300
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,120
people have concerns they should raise

301
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,000
those

302
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,519
now or during the working group last

303
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,519
call

304
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,680
so i put myself on the on the queue um

305
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,360
i'll um

306
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,800
just taking off my chair head for a

307
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,040
while so you know there was a discussion

308
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,800
in in sag

309
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,560
around sort of the you know the work

310
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,160
they're doing on deprecating or

311
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,800
promoting or or

312
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,720
some somehow uh

313
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,440
signaling around uh crypto suites and

314
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,680
you made the comment that you know this

315
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,600
work really should have been or could

316
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,320
have been in and done in utah is there

317
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,079
any like synchronization we should be

318
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,279
doing there

319
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,160
any comment on that

320
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,720
if you're asking i

321
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,079
this is more of a good question to our

322
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,479
good ads

323
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
again i guess we can i can restate the

324
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,519
question to our 80s is this something

325
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,360
the uk should care about or should we

326
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,279
just ignore that work or hope for the

327
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,920
best or or talk to tls working group

328
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,639
what should we be doing

329
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,760
um hi you're talking about what was

330
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,519
presented in sag if i understand

331
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,160
correctly i wasn't there so i can't talk

332
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,720
to that i'm sorry but i will check with

333
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,480
ben afterward and

334
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,600
look at the

335
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,360
recordings and notes

336
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,160
um but i'll get back

337
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,240
oh yeah that'd be great to appreciate it

338
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
i mean there is sort of an apparent

339
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,399
jargon called that out during saga there

340
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,480
is sort of an apparent conflict here i

341
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,000
mean some

342
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,880
tls is essentially doing sort of a

343
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,759
a work making recommendations on crypto

344
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,360
switch which is kind of duplicates um at

345
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,120
least the intention of what the uta was

346
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,759
supposed to be doing um and others had

347
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,600
made also made comments i think harness

348
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,320
made a comment that well you know

349
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,720
there is a there's there is often a

350
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,360
tendency to to focus on

351
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,839
the the web use case for tls rather than

352
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,519
sort of other application use cases for

353
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,240
tls which kind of also gets mixed in

354
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,320
with that discussion but anyway yeah go

355
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,360
um we'd be uh really appreciate any kind

356
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,519
of guidance here

357
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,519
yeah thank you for flagging that

358
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,519
uh i don't know if ben wants to say

359
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,480
anything now but otherwise i will uh

360
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,880
well hear you here you are ben

361
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,880
i don't have anything terribly useful to

362
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,680
say now but i think that we as the 80s

363
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,519
can take an action item to coordinate

364
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,519
with the chairs of the various groups

365
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,880
and

366
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,240
get a real answer for this topic yeah

367
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,639
we'll do that

368
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,320
yeah just to put my hand up quickly to

369
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,720
say that last time around we um

370
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,079
you know we did cross post when there

371
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,079
was a working class call i believe in in

372
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,000
the utah working group we cross posted

373
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,640
to probably dls working group and zag

374
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,799
and other places so that folks were

375
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,319
aware that this was

376
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,400
the place to provide feedback

377
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,720
on that document but it sounds i wasn't

378
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,000
in this ag session either but it sounds

379
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,919
like there was a bit of a broader topic

380
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,520
that came up but we certainly we should

381
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,880
at least make folks aware of what's

382
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,079
going on here

383
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,399
thanks

384
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,280
so my question to your own and peter

385
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,919
so i think from from what you presented

386
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,360
i think that's uh

387
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,760
probably most challenging uh is the last

388
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,640
issue

389
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,600
it's reviewing for 100

390
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,480
customer rfcs uh

391
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,600
so do you think it is visible and

392
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,320
in what time

393
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,240
and we almost already know

394
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,440
yeah we already ran through this review

395
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,720
couple of hours and

396
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,400
we need to to get together and make sure

397
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,799
that there are no

398
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,960
surprise findings

399
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,880
but bearing that

400
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,000
we can close that issue

401
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,880
as well i believe as the other issues

402
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,240
again

403
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,679
we do need working group feedback

404
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,280
on these issues

405
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,120
but i think we have a way forward

406
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,080
and so we are we are

407
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,840
very near work and group last call

408
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,400
and uh one of the actions that we depend

409
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,600
on is the adoption of uh

410
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,420
a draft

411
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,520
[Music]

412
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,919
that deprecates uh well

413
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,440
and the roundtable is deprecated

414
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,200
absolute gates

415
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,600
into this working group uh

416
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,880
is it right

417
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,400
so we are waiting for the drop to be

418
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,400
adopted

419
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,880
we have not

420
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,280
i don't know that we have a position as

421
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,240
an editorial team my personal position

422
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,960
is as long as it's not

423
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,559
adopted we don't have a dependency on it

424
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,120
so we can go into working group let's

425
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,080
call whether it moves forward or not

426
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,360
okay

427
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,440
thank you

428
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,480
thank you

429
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,080
your own i think that was going to be an

430
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,600
informational reference anyway wasn't it

431
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,880
or was it we were going to have a

432
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
normative reference on that

433
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,720
the keck stock

434
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,919
so even if it's informational

435
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,000
but it does uh

436
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
declare

437
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,600
some things as deprecated

438
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,919
it's much much better for us to be in

439
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,400
think

440
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,120
you should tour

441
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,520
so thank you thank you very much

442
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,320
thank you and i think we can go to the

443
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,360
next

444
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,880
yeah just one more quick note on that i

445
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,320
guess you know people are going to be

446
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,640
people are always deprecating things and

447
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,960
you know uh two weeks after we published

448
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,080
the the rfc that replaces 75 25 bit

449
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,280
someone could decide to replace

450
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,200
something else right so these documents

451
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,880
are sort of a snapshot in time at some

452
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,320
level the best current practice and

453
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
that's what the current is all about you

454
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,640
know so i i would expect at some point

455
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,640
we're going to uh you know have another

456
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,720
update to this document at some point uh

457
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,240
you know 10 years from now or whatever

458
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,080
and we'll we'll be deprecating other

459
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,760
things so we can't track everything that

460
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,679
people are doing at all moments but this

461
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,360
is sort of a snapshot in time of what we

462
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,799
see as the best things to do right now

463
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,720
yeah i guess my question would be is

464
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,919
there would it be is there anything

465
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,559
useful you could say pay attention to

466
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,600
this

467
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,880
for whatever this to see what gets

468
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,640
deprecated in the future whether that's

469
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,360
the ayanna registry or

470
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,320
pls is there a easy way just to point

471
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,520
you need to point somebody out and say

472
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,400
hey

473
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,840
this is where when things get deprecated

474
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,240
this will be where you'll find out so

475
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,679
um attention there

476
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,640
so this goes back to

477
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,280
the comment about coordination between

478
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,720
the tls and the utah working groups

479
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,919
uh if tls is publishing documents about

480
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,440
deprecation

481
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,840
then this is where you will see new

482
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,360
things being all

483
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,799
things being deprecated

484
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,880
otherwise

485
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,960
we will need to to find some other

486
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,960
mechanism

487
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,559
good job

488
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,720
go ahead please

489
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,159
okay hi um

490
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,919
jeff galloway one of the co-chairs of

491
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,919
tls yeah so

492
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,640
i i think the intention is to to adopt

493
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,799
that we were trying to merge

494
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,440
the content of two drafts and we're

495
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,200
waiting for some uh

496
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,440
action from the officer so

497
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,360
i'll take that action item to follow up

498
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,200
at least on this uh

499
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,799
rsa uh kicks or the kickstart

500
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:21,840
um

501
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,360
there is

502
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,240
as to the broader uh coordination

503
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,520
question i think yeah we should

504
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,159
definitely have a have a chat between

505
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,159
the chairs and make sure that we're you

506
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,080
know kind of working with the two groups

507
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,880
as best we can because um

508
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,559
i don't think there should be

509
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,880
you know conflicts of interest here i

510
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,000
mean uh you know we're all kind of

511
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,440
working towards the same goal and i

512
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,320
think

513
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,840
the things we're putting together to

514
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
kind of signal recommended

515
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,360
um are

516
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,280
you know mechanisms that any group in

517
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,880
the ietf can use to uh you know put

518
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,760
documents together to to do that um but

519
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,200
certainly we absolutely want

520
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,760
coordination

521
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,240
i agree

522
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,799
let's try to coordinate

523
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,240
our effort thank you

524
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,800
and

525
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,440
[Music]

526
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,520
we can start next presentation

527
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,960
so rich

528
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,240
please go ahead

529
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,360
okay

530
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,840
next slide

531
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,159
all right um so last time i talked about

532
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,919
plan changes

533
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,919
they were all done basically the

534
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,600
directory text x500

535
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,640
died unloved unmourned nobody said

536
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,120
simplifying the texts

537
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,880
an appendix

538
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,279
related to simplifying the text you know

539
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,039
if this is a standard then you should do

540
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,559
this we can remove those constructs

541
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,840
so next slide

542
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,159
uh so here were a couple items that were

543
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,320
issues last time that we had consent

544
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,880
that we got consensus on uh wild cards

545
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,200
is simplified so you can only do you

546
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,159
know star.example.com

547
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,520
you can't do

548
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,080
you know

549
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,640
web.star.example.com you can't do

550
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,440
starweb.example.com

551
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,320
nobody on the list was opposed

552
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,600
um the commentary is on the wrong slide

553
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,080
um

554
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,679
the removing pinning um yeah that that

555
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,760
detailed section and and having that

556
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,039
well if you found a match and didn't

557
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,200
find a match look at the pinning uh

558
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,120
victor had a couple of paragraphs of

559
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
text that i think made a lot of sense so

560
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,440
those were merged in

561
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,520
my mistake this had always intended to

562
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,159
be a standards thing and so it's

563
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,200
still proposed standard not ecp

564
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,760
uh there is more use of the you know

565
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,600
must may should should not language

566
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,520
and then the final pass is is a pr

567
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,240
waiting to happen

568
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,799
next page

569
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,720
okay so uh other changes there were lots

570
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,360
of editorial changes uh one of my main

571
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,760
goals was to reduce the list of terms

572
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,039
used

573
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,039
um just so it was easier to for people

574
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,960
to digest

575
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,600
more text about why common name is bad

576
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,480
and evil you should not use it

577
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,440
a lot of that came from ryan sleevy

578
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,000
um and now you know just read the whole

579
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,480
darn thing it's not that long

580
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,960
but the other big change that's happened

581
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,400
since the last 10 years is

582
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,679
tlssni is assumed to be used

583
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,000
or assumed to be available

584
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
and so a lot of simplifying assumptions

585
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,559
could be made

586
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,799
next

587
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,279
so

588
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,720
a couple things

589
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,440
like to discuss um

590
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,120
brian had

591
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,960
submitted some text on multiple

592
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,480
identifiers as in what you do if

593
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,200
the client isn't sure which identifier

594
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,799
it's using and

595
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,559
if the certificate the presented

596
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,159
identifiers have multiple things in them

597
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,919
um there's some security implications

598
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,480
from that that was posted to the list it

599
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,240
hadn't gotten much comment

600
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,840
uh but i'd like the working group to

601
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,320
look at that i'll post a reminder you

602
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,559
know a week or two after the

603
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,039
ietf when things have settled down

604
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,039
and say hey please let me know if you

605
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,120
disagree

606
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,720
uh

607
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,440
there's also some editorial changes

608
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,880
minor wording things nothing

609
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,200
semantically changes with this pr that

610
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,480
i've got

611
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,720
um hopefully a better title

612
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,559
so maybe something like naming in

613
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,600
verifying service names in tls

614
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,640
um

615
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,080
i look at the

616
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,400
the hedge dac

617
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,679
minutes and you know the the title there

618
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,760
of that agenda item takes up the whole

619
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,640
page so we should obviously fix that

620
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,880
um it doesn't have to be

621
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,720
completely descriptive there's enough

622
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,520
context you know people aren't gonna say

623
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,279
oh what should i name my baby let's look

624
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,840
at this ietf rfc and see oh it's got

625
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,559
naming in here

626
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,559
peter's been

627
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,039
obviously kind of busy with the rfc

628
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,120
editor program so he and i need to sync

629
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,880
up see if there's more

630
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,120
from what he'd wanted to do or was

631
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,840
hoping to get done from 61.25 jeff has

632
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,559
already said no

633
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,399
it might be ready for working group last

634
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,640
call in january

635
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,039
depending on how much the maybe list is

636
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,279
right so that's it that's the update

637
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,760
um

638
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,320
my comment on this slide

639
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,960
uh i strongly support the idea to change

640
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,720
the title because currently the title is

641
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,919
way too long it takes three lines of two

642
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,399
or three lines of text and

643
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,919
if you can do it with more condensed way

644
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,080
not losing the sense of the document it

645
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,440
will be great

646
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,919
and i strongly support this idea because

647
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:18,720
it is

648
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,039
it's easy to reference the document

649
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,840
is a short title

650
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,760
and yeah we'll come up with something

651
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,360
shorter right i don't even remember how

652
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,880
jeff and i came up with such a long

653
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,399
title but we'll

654
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,679
we'll definitely have something much

655
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,360
better

656
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,678
thank you

657
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:36,770
so

658
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,159
[Music]

659
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,960
anyone in the queue

660
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,880
hey

661
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,679
rich here again i'm wondering just like

662
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,520
we did for 75 25 i know there's dozens

663
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,520
and dozens of documents that cite 61.25

664
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,080
we might want to do the same thing that

665
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,440
um garon and thomas just did

666
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,039
it's not that hard most things are just

667
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,760
have sort of a perfunctory citation but

668
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,919
um so i think that would be a good thing

669
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,520
for us to do before working group last

670
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,679
call and and the uh

671
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,440
i think that the rfc editor stuff should

672
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,440
sort of calm down here

673
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,760
after i publish the next version so i'll

674
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,360
have some i'll have some cycles to help

675
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,120
with that

676
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,840
okay yeah great we can

677
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,799
divide it up offline but yeah i yes it's

678
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,919
a

679
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,760
commonly referred to daca we should make

680
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,159
sure nobody's going to get

681
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,159
too upset

682
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,640
according to yay according to yachty's

683
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,679
uh

684
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,240
stats it looks like 73 rfcs site 6125 so

685
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,399
we can go through the things and it's

686
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,679
it's not it's probably not going to be a

687
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,520
horrible task

688
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,440
sounds good i mean

689
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,520
you know like i said i think the big the

690
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,399
big change is sni and if anyone is not

691
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,559
willing to accommodate sni you know that

692
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,559
bug is on them not on us

693
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,760
yep

694
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,399
okay cool

695
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,600
so

696
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
thank you

697
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,320
and

698
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,720
some other comments

699
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,320
okay

700
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
it seems that the queue is empty

701
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,159
so

702
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,760
let's go for the next presentation

703
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,799
so harness

704
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,600
please go ahead

705
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,039
hey guys can you hear me

706
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,640
yes we can hear you

707
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,880
okay

708
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,440
perfect okay uh

709
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,760
yeah um thanks for giving me

710
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,559
time to talk about this document

711
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,559
um put a couple of slides together on

712
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,279
the open issues um and maybe

713
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,880
some of you can provide a little bit of

714
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,720
feedback on this next slide

715
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,640
so

716
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,120
there's really four issues

717
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,760
which i would like to talk about today

718
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,159
um one is on

719
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,360
an issue with uh ccm8

720
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,720
uh when

721
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,399
so

722
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:23,679
ddls103 is in

723
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,960
uh in us 48 and and there's uh

724
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,840
in appendix there's some very clear

725
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,279
analysis

726
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,480
on

727
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,360
what the security is that ccma provides

728
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,640
and so

729
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,799
that's a little bit

730
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,440
even to someone who is uh remotely

731
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,039
familiar with cryptography a little bit

732
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,399
it raises the question of whether the

733
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,880
security of ccm8 is actually a good

734
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,360
thing going forward so we had a lot of

735
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,039
discussions on this in different groups

736
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,640
um so i would like to summarize those

737
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,120
and make a proposal on the way forward

738
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,279
the second item is about the initial

739
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,279
timer values

740
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,240
and

741
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,559
the idea of relaxing those we made some

742
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,960
recommendations in the

743
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,880
1.2 version of the

744
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,840
of the pcb

745
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,960
and

746
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,799
the dls uh and ddls 103 specifically

747
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,679
dds-103 handles um retransmissions

748
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,200
differently uh

749
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,360
than before so so that's uh something to

750
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,640
look at again

751
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,080
there was also a

752
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,799
longer discussion on the dls mailing

753
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,159
list about

754
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,640
long collect connections that people use

755
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,679
um in in the industrial iot space

756
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,279
and so there are some problems

757
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,120
associated with that

758
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
and

759
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,480
that's the the third item and finally um

760
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,120
that's the topic of uh what identifiers

761
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,320
go into these end entity certificates

762
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,120
um and what recommendations or examples

763
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,360
could we provide there or probably

764
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,039
provide better guidance

765
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,200
what people use

766
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,799
of course you can find more on the

767
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,159
github

768
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,519
issue page

769
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,360
okay let's start with the ccm8 topic

770
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,559
so um

771
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,600
maybe not um surprising to to you guys

772
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,519
uh but the integrity limits of ccm8 uh

773
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,279
are quite low um

774
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,679
obviously due to the reduced tax size

775
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:24,799
and

776
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,519
um if there's a very good document in

777
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,720
cfrt

778
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,720
that goes through different algorithms

779
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,799
and and provides obviously with tunable

780
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,440
parameters um

781
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,799
sort of like

782
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,559
in some sense some guidance for

783
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,120
developers on how they could uh make a

784
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,640
judgment of whether they want to take

785
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,440
the risk of using ccm8 or

786
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,799
of course or other algorithms and based

787
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,919
on those

788
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,360
assumptions

789
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,360
and

790
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,279
what is also so

791
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,679
my our conclusion thomas and and mine

792
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,799
was um after revisiting uh that

793
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:01,840
literature

794
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,039
and uh and the reference specifications

795
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,799
we kind of came to the conclusion that

796
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,520
we have really difficulties

797
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,679
recommending ccm8 to anyone these days

798
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,440
unfortunately it's the

799
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,440
only mandatory to implement cyber suit

800
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,440
in co-op

801
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,399
and

802
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,719
so there's some some side effects of

803
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,639
making any recommendations it sounds

804
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,800
kind of weird to make a recommendation

805
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,719
not to use it when others idf

806
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,119
specifications uh do otherwise

807
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,639
and and of course

808
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,918
we can't just change it and then people

809
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,719
are upset of course

810
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,199
next slide

811
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,639
so we had some

812
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,719
some discussions on on the lists on

813
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,159
different mailing lists called mailing

814
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,440
lists um

815
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,480
uh we also discussed this in in dls uh

816
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,879
even multiple times and

817
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,920
there are different um the cfrg document

818
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,320
i don't remember the exact draft name

819
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,520
but um

820
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,119
there are different tunable parameters

821
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,359
so you can shuffle things around like

822
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,400
message lengths or how many attempts you

823
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,079
are going to give an attacker before he

824
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,400
learns something and so on and so on but

825
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,880
um and that's essentially the approach

826
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,160
that um

827
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,680
oscar takes

828
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,280
or at least uh

829
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,440
appears to be taking um

830
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,960
with one of the recent drafts um

831
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,280
and the approach is uh obviously one

832
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,880
possibility to give the developer

833
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,520
possibility to make their own judgment

834
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,000
on uh whether that's a reasonable choice

835
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,240
in a specific environment

836
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,359
but there's also a downside um as you

837
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,280
probably know is like developers are

838
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,560
often

839
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,119
um not really in a good position to make

840
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,599
um that type of risk assessment

841
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,440
because they may not necessarily always

842
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,200
know all the parameters on

843
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,440
on the deployment environment or

844
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,240
like

845
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,680
you deploy it initially here and then

846
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,200
you would deploy it there

847
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,359
uh so so the environments may be very

848
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,480
different so um as i as i mentioned on

849
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,839
on earlier i'm i'm inclined to say hey

850
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,000
let's not recommend this um which of

851
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,440
course then leaves the question about

852
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,280
what would we recommend otherwise which

853
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,720
is um something on the next slide

854
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,000
um so that's that was our approach i see

855
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,680
daryl suggesting having other

856
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,400
sort of approaches and i that was the

857
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,800
rickard mentions the oscar document that

858
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,640
was just referring to

859
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,680
um and and maybe maybe this is uh a

860
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,480
place where utah uh can provide

861
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,000
recommendations so at least um

862
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,839
consolidate the discussion so that we

863
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,079
have a kind of a uniform

864
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,640
approach to this but um

865
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,040
this is just my take on the story from

866
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,560
also reading the mailing list so in

867
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,040
if if we pick something else if we say

868
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,040
ccm8 is uh

869
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,760
has this bandwidth uh reduction

870
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,000
improvement because the tag is shorter

871
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,040
uh but

872
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,079
um

873
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,640
it's maybe not worth it um given given

874
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,800
the security aspects

875
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,839
one could of course use ccm

876
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:12,880
instead

877
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,720
because that's

878
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,599
already implemented in the devices

879
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,480
the downside of that is that

880
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,280
ccm as well as ccm8 is is

881
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,599
in if you look at uh

882
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,160
sort of like the common iot cloud-based

883
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,160
services is not something

884
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,079
that is um

885
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,440
frequently

886
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,880
uh offered

887
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,680
so

888
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,400
in in general like there's obviously uh

889
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,720
if you switch from cesium 8

890
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,800
to something that is uh more widely

891
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,040
supported than gcm would be a better

892
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,520
choice but of course gcm is

893
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,520
wouldn't be available in

894
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,920
in hardware on those iot devices because

895
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,440
for many years we have told them to

896
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,280
implement ccm

897
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,200
the the um

898
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,880
and of course there's a

899
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,200
there's a cypher suit um available for

900
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,000
that

901
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,280
as well um and

902
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,200
also the uh

903
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,839
using uh gcm with uh with sha 256 um

904
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,359
uh has

905
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,079
has different uh impact on on like code

906
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,800
size ram usage etc as i as i wrote here

907
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,160
but it's not a

908
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,200
a big drama i would say of course 660

909
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,400
bytes is not nothing if it's um if it's

910
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,680
in software

911
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,280
uh which in this case in for many

912
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,839
devices it would be

913
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,119
um maybe maybe there are other

914
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,359
approaches some people mentioned uh

915
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,720
um police certainly the cha-cha poly

916
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,200
algorithm but

917
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,880
that may be maybe a possibility um

918
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,560
if it's specifically if it's implemented

919
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,920
in software

920
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,040
um another approach would be to wait a

921
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,040
little bit um because there's that nist

922
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,280
lightweight crypto competition ongoing

923
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,720
and maybe there's something that falls

924
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,800
out of that that is more constraint

925
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,359
friendly but in general i have to say

926
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,280
like it's not so easy to say like what

927
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,119
would be a suitable

928
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,359
alternative here

929
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,320
um

930
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,680
and

931
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,920
at this point i would welcome

932
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,440
feedback from

933
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,160
the folks in a group what you think

934
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,839
should be best done whether this whole

935
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,960
idea of moving on from ccm8

936
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,400
is is uh

937
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,920
it's a bad idea and we should just

938
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,599
reinterpret

939
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,680
the analysis which of course we can do

940
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,800
by

941
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,480
picking different uh

942
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,320
um

943
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,920
what setting the parameters to different

944
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,960
values

945
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,480
or what theirs maybe they're totally

946
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,280
different ideas as well

947
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,560
a few comments

948
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,119
as participants not as the chair

949
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,680
so uh and probably

950
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,560
uh john will john i think john betson is

951
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,040
a queue and probably he will uh have a

952
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,240
better

953
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,359
uh

954
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,599
provides a better comment but i've today

955
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,720
i've reread his message to cephergy with

956
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,240
analysis of

957
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,839
ccm8

958
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,880
and the bottom line as i got it

959
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,200
is that uh well htm 8 is

960
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,960
has a limitation

961
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,359
but it is not a disaster it is not a

962
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:14,800
disaster if you limit the number of

963
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,040
messages that are sent

964
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,839
and if we are talking about iot

965
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,040
uh we are not talking about gigabits and

966
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
tens of gigabytes

967
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,119
links it's usually a

968
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,359
relatively small number of messages that

969
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,240
are sent so that is probably not so bad

970
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,078
but well i think john

971
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,359
will comment better on it so john please

972
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,599
go ahead

973
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,720
yeah so

974
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,839
um

975
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,240
sorry to honest that i promised hummus

976
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,560
to comment more on this in cf audi and i

977
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,720
have not done that i'm sorry for

978
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,839
that but as i said in song i think

979
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,000
it the analysis down for tls dtls and

980
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,520
quick um

981
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,839
turns out very wrong for cccm a

982
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,640
what the process does is that it

983
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,200
calculates integrity advantage for a

984
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,720
single key i think that is does not have

985
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,160
much value for

986
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,720
when you are in the security protocols

987
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,800
when you have multiple keys and you're

988
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,520
doing frequent re-keying so i think

989
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,200
basically re-keying ccm8 as the dkls

990
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,520
suggests every future power of 8 doesn't

991
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,520
improve security at all i don't think

992
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,359
there's any denial of service attacks

993
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,520
here i think the important security

994
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,440
measure in ccm8 is the 64-bit

995
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,280
tagline i think

996
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,400
that is very much okay for

997
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,119
for

998
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,160
iot raid you have basically never seen

999
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,599
any practical attack on 64 or hardly on

1000
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,839
32

1001
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,119
max either so i think uh i think the

1002
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,319
only

1003
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,640
and for a 64-bit

1004
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,040
mac ccm8 is

1005
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,680
quite it's very good as you can see from

1006
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,359
the

1007
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,160
equations in the see if audi drops i

1008
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,880
think

1009
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,720
you wouldn't there will not be any

1010
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,920
better

1011
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,960
mac with 64 bits from the from the mist

1012
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,800
you might get something more lightweight

1013
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,680
with 128 bits i think

1014
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,000
um

1015
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,720
yeah i'll comment more on tfr in the

1016
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,520
coming weeks when i get some time

1017
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,440
yeah

1018
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,359
i can echo

1019
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,720
um

1020
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,839
yeah

1021
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,880
we we obviously went through them uh ira

1022
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,119
posted the the link to the document and

1023
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:41,839
the

1024
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,000
references to further there's references

1025
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,079
to further materials and we went through

1026
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,160
those um and also discussed it with

1027
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,319
internally with uh

1028
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,359
cryptographers we have there's um

1029
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,760
there's nothing wrong in the analysis

1030
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,319
it's just a question of like

1031
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,000
how um

1032
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,480
about the setting of the parameters uh

1033
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,640
and whether whether you consider this

1034
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,400
the result that you get out of it uh

1035
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
whether you consider that a problem or

1036
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,079
whether you consider

1037
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,680
potentially frequent re-keying

1038
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,359
specifically if you

1039
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,960
if you don't want to give an attack an

1040
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,079
advantage

1041
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,440
by

1042
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,319
having him probe you and try things out

1043
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,760
uh and then the question is like how

1044
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,839
many of the packets did you then

1045
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:28,000
um except uh

1046
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,240
at what point in time of failed uh

1047
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,800
decryptions do you then

1048
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,119
uh re-key and that's that's sort of the

1049
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,200
question of course in some of the

1050
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,079
iot networking technologies um the

1051
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,560
bandwidth is indeed very limited uh so

1052
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,720
so that's uh they are

1053
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,119
and maybe maybe those um

1054
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,960
they have their own uh link clear

1055
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,640
security making like i'm thinking about

1056
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,079
laura

1057
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,599
laura van

1058
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,440
but others um

1059
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,880
that's why it gets

1060
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,119
tricky is like

1061
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,839
um in some other technologies let's say

1062
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,920
a device that is connected using wi-fi

1063
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,040
uh let's say a wi-fi camera um

1064
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,480
and uh

1065
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,880
or something something like this uh what

1066
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,119
did what are they um

1067
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,520
what is that device going to do like

1068
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,040
developers need to then make the

1069
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,040
judgment and are these developers able

1070
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,599
to make a proper judgment or do they

1071
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:22,960
don't care

1072
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,760
um

1073
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,960
i i don't know

1074
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,079
it's it's really tricky

1075
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,720
so john

1076
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,839
will you answer

1077
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,200
don't uh continue

1078
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,520
okay you can hear this yeah i don't know

1079
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,160
if i have them i don't think you need to

1080
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,440
do any reason very frequent

1081
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,599
readings i don't think any denial of

1082
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,920
service is a problem

1083
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,000
at all you do need to do a re-keying for

1084
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,280
all of these

1085
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,880
protocols but i don't think you need to

1086
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,599
do any more frequent reading for ccm8

1087
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,280
than you need for

1088
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,640
ccm

1089
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,240
ccm the full order for gcm i think that

1090
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,240
conclusion this if our

1091
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,599
draft is wrong

1092
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,599
i don't think that's true

1093
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:20,640
um

1094
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,280
on that aspect um my understanding is

1095
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,119
that in order to not provide um

1096
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,839
the attacker

1097
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,960
an advantage you need to after a number

1098
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,839
of attempts um failed attempts to

1099
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:37,200
um

1100
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,880
to send packets

1101
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,040
sort of fabricated packets you need to

1102
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,280
re-key that's the or terminator

1103
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,319
connection

1104
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,440
and that would be a problem right

1105
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,359
that that's a problem with all the

1106
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,920
algorithms

1107
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,040
but the limits are different

1108
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:55,920
i think

1109
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,400
i think that conclusion is wrong i don't

1110
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,800
think you need to read ecm eight more

1111
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,880
frequencies the full ccm i think that's

1112
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,599
a wrong conclusion in the

1113
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,880
in the dtls tls analysis i think the

1114
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,800
reason why they didn't

1115
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,480
is that they didn't really care about

1116
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,599
ccm

1117
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,680
eight um

1118
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,760
okay that's that would be in that would

1119
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,880
be worthwhile to explore uh a little bit

1120
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,680
further um yeah that was not our

1121
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,839
impression

1122
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:30,400
yeah we can bring this to severe g

1123
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,839
and uh

1124
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:35,119
john can you please uh send the comments

1125
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,960
on this and uh

1126
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,960
to cfg and probably

1127
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,720
cc to utah so that we can

1128
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,119
so my comment is that

1129
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,839
in i if you if i talk about wi-fi i

1130
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,319
don't think that's an iot device

1131
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,400
i think anything that is having more

1132
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,400
than one megabit of second

1133
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,880
link is not an iot device i mean on

1134
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,440
wi-fi saving you know

1135
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,440
uh you know

1136
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,880
eight bytes from the ccm is is not

1137
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,440
pointless i mean if we we only think

1138
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,920
about the ccm egg on very slow links

1139
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,319
when you don't have enough bandwidth to

1140
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,640
use the full size of the tag or you

1141
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,319
don't want to waste their battery time

1142
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,800
on the server and in that case i would

1143
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,800
actually think it would be better to say

1144
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,160
that okay ccm8 is okay on iot devices

1145
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,800
which are using smaller than certain

1146
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,839
bandwidth

1147
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,319
link and it doesn't matter how many how

1148
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,680
how fast the attacker can send the

1149
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,400
packets if they are still going to the

1150
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,280
one one megabit or 100 kilobits per

1151
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,760
second link it can only send certain

1152
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,160
amount of tries per second

1153
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,359
uh you know 15 four for example i have a

1154
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:02,720
100 byte max 127 byte maximum pocket

1155
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,760
length and there is 2 to the 32 pockets

1156
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,079
maximum for each you know

1157
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:09,680
session and it takes about a year to

1158
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,040
send those

1159
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,160
so you know wreaking once per month

1160
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,720
and you know it limits very much how

1161
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,880
much of you know

1162
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,559
price you can do

1163
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,000
so that's why i was thinking about

1164
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,599
having the bandwidth limit and saying

1165
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,720
that it is for iot and iot is defined

1166
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,319
having something that is bandwidth less

1167
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,720
than this

1168
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:34,160
taking a bandwidth limit yeah we could

1169
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,760
definitely look into that

1170
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,359
because the the

1171
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,160
yeah the message size and uh the number

1172
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,400
of messages is obviously a factor in the

1173
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,599
in the equation uh so yeah that will

1174
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,400
take that into consideration

1175
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,280
so can we go further yep

1176
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,760
next slide

1177
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,720
um

1178
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,839
yeah so the uh the initial timer value

1179
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:03,280
so in the previous rc we had a very high

1180
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,319
initial timer value for the dtls uh 1.2

1181
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,160
handshake simply because of the

1182
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,800
retransmission uh mechanism which worked

1183
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,839
on the whole flight so if you had some

1184
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,559
radio technology where for whatever

1185
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,559
reason because of the high latency or

1186
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,400
because of um

1187
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,640
some congestion you had difficulties

1188
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,520
getting

1189
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,720
the the

1190
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,200
as a flight through in time

1191
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,240
then

1192
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,559
that was obviously a a big obstacle

1193
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,319
because then you would retransmit the

1194
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,000
whole thing and then uh you make the

1195
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,720
whole situation worse um so that's why

1196
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,000
uh the

1197
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,480
uh there was this high initial uh timer

1198
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,920
value selected

1199
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,599
um

1200
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,839
and and also not just uh over the wire

1201
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,079
transmission but also um

1202
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,760
the operations that take place on the

1203
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,839
device so nine seconds sounds pretty

1204
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,559
pretty high um like when you when you

1205
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,640
hear it but if you take also into

1206
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,880
consideration that some of the devices

1207
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,119
are actually also constrained devices

1208
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:02,800
that talk to each other

1209
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,839
so there's uh you can seconds add up

1210
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,480
slow communication and so on um we also

1211
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,559
had the use of

1212
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,400
at that time when he worked on his

1213
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,640
um the use of

1214
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,800
ddls over uh over sms and um for some of

1215
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,920
the

1216
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,319
network deployments which were had very

1217
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,839
limited uh

1218
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,280
cell coverage

1219
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,119
so obviously there you had a lot of

1220
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,359
latency as well and and that made total

1221
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,359
sense at that time

1222
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,000
okay next slide

1223
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,720
and then um in dtls 1.3 we changed the

1224
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,400
retransmission mechanism

1225
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,440
from

1226
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,000
a flight base to a record-based

1227
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,440
mechanism and we added this

1228
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,400
message

1229
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,280
and

1230
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,119
that is obviously

1231
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,280
gives more possibilities than what we

1232
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,920
had available in in the 102 version and

1233
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,240
so um

1234
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,400
we thought i that it would be time to

1235
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,599
reduce

1236
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,040
and or relax uh that initial timer value

1237
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,160
down to

1238
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,880
um something like uh like obviously

1239
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,720
multiple options um

1240
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,040
uh we thought maybe something like three

1241
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,240
seconds like it's uh suggested in in rc

1242
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:22,640
29 8080 or even going further down um

1243
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,520
like uh some of the other rfcs do um

1244
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,280
maybe a middle ground would be would be

1245
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,800
good but definitely having something

1246
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,559
lower would be beneficial for

1247
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,000
implementations to actually have a

1248
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,839
reasonable performance because

1249
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,520
um first of all many of the networks

1250
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,359
changed in the meanwhile deployments

1251
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,319
changed and also the

1252
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:46,160
the capabilities of 1.3 is different

1253
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,119
and

1254
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,640
i don't know if there's any objection to

1255
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,800
this whether someone has some

1256
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,119
some deployments that uh

1257
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,160
really require a very high

1258
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,720
uh initial timer value

1259
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,640
but if not then

1260
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,480
i think we would we should go ahead and

1261
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,839
relax it

1262
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,319
okay i don't have anything on this issue

1263
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,640
you can bring this to the list but yeah

1264
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,319
yeah i'm planning to

1265
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,559
post all the issues again to the list uh

1266
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,160
they they are um

1267
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,599
they're also in the in the github page

1268
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,359
but it's probably good to

1269
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,000
um sort of confirm some of the things

1270
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,960
okay next slide

1271
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,559
um

1272
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,559
so this was a longer discussion that was

1273
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,400
triggered by stephen fries who works for

1274
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,680
siemens uh who has been using iot

1275
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,760
in in sort of like in this

1276
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,599
industry 4.0

1277
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,559
context and apparently they use dls

1278
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:45,680
connections

1279
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,480
with a very long uh

1280
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,079
uh lifetime

1281
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:50,960
and

1282
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,599
that creates some some problems um

1283
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,240
because uh like he was talking about

1284
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,960
certificates uh expiring

1285
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,520
and and uh like how do you do um

1286
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,480
re-authentication and and all these sort

1287
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,720
of questions and uh here's the link also

1288
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,800
included in case you want to read this

1289
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,839
up and so um we had a discussion with

1290
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:16,079
stefan after after the debate and

1291
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,040
and

1292
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,720
we thought that would be a good idea to

1293
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,440
capture some of his um concerns or some

1294
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,760
of the the challenges he has none of

1295
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,280
which require

1296
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,160
really protocol changes luckily but i

1297
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,480
think it's just something that is good

1298
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,640
for developers to know like what are

1299
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,400
some of the differences um in a dtls 1.3

1300
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,680
deployment

1301
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,480
um

1302
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,440
that

1303
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,520
compared to a 1.2 deployment when you

1304
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,520
actually use these

1305
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,280
connections that last for a very long

1306
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,760
time and specifically now as with the

1307
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,680
cid that's even easier to have these

1308
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,680
long-standing connections

1309
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,599
so

1310
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,119
i think that

1311
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,400
that's uh

1312
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,240
that's something we wanted to add and if

1313
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,720
uh someone of you has a deployment with

1314
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,960
similar characteristics i think uh that

1315
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,240
would be extremely valuable input um

1316
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,880
i know like the iot segment is very

1317
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,640
fragmented people work in all sorts of

1318
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,480
different environments and so it's uh

1319
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,800
sometimes difficult to get um sort of

1320
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,800
the inputs from all these different uh

1321
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,640
environments whether you're working on a

1322
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,800
sort of more industrial setup or a more

1323
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,680
uh

1324
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,800
home

1325
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,520
iot deployment or whatsoever whatever

1326
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,480
okay

1327
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,960
oh john

1328
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,760
yeah i think

1329
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,599
it might be good to

1330
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,280
mention that you get

1331
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,880
a bit

1332
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,359
lower security i haven't read what you

1333
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,960
write in the

1334
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,079
document but tls.3 for

1335
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,400
long connections give forward secrecy

1336
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,319
but that only protects you in one

1337
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:57,720
direction kls 1.2 with frequent

1338
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,359
renegotiation

1339
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:02,720
uh protects you in both directions so if

1340
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,480
an attacker

1341
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,400
steals a key they can only they're

1342
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,440
limited in the date double forward and

1343
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,680
backward but that's um

1344
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,040
i don't know

1345
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,760
most iot you cannot

1346
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,160
it's more a consideration than any

1347
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,799
technical exchange

1348
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,799
yeah it's definitely uh good to make

1349
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,079
those uh

1350
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,079
those type of remarks yeah and capture

1351
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:26,880
those

1352
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,480
aspects uh we'll do john

1353
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,559
okay uh next slide

1354
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,640
what else

1355
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,599
exactly

1356
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:39,200
so um we relax the requirement on

1357
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,799
the use of the eoi 64 um for the end

1358
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,599
entity uh client certificates

1359
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:46,839
and uh

1360
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:48,799
because um

1361
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,319
just different deployments use very

1362
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,319
different identifiers for devices so

1363
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,920
it's very difficult to

1364
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,720
um mandate one specific identifier and

1365
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,760
that's already in the document um

1366
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,799
when when we made that change um

1367
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:04,799
we got uh feedback from

1368
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,280
from some who suggested that we actually

1369
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,920
provide some specific examples of uh

1370
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,400
other identifiers um

1371
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,240
and and the ones that were mentioned to

1372
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,280
us where

1373
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,079
from the gsma for cellular deployments

1374
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,680
um

1375
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,319
of course and then also

1376
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,720
in the in the case of lightweight mdm it

1377
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,359
has a couple of different identifiers

1378
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:28,640
specified

1379
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,119
and to give some guidance because that's

1380
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,880
often

1381
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,079
a point that confuses what

1382
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,160
people like to discuss uh about

1383
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,520
identities of iot devices

1384
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,599
i like to prefer to talk about

1385
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,559
identifiers makes it less uh

1386
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:47,760
dramatic

1387
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,720
but

1388
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,119
and then there are also different types

1389
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,000
of identifiers at different stages

1390
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,079
whether we're talking about things that

1391
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,960
happen during manufacturing or

1392
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,799
whether we're talking about the

1393
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,040
identifiers that are then

1394
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,480
used sort of like the operational

1395
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,480
certificates as some people

1396
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,920
used to call them

1397
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,000
and um

1398
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,200
i think in even in the idf there's some

1399
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,599
for some of the iot related protocols

1400
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,160
there's some diversity of what uh

1401
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,160
gets populated for these uh client um

1402
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,400
these these uh identifiers for client

1403
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,799
certificates if you look at uh things

1404
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,079
like

1405
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,240
anima brisket or

1406
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,920
those type of devices where you need to

1407
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,400
have certain um

1408
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,319
like they are not opaque identifiers

1409
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:37,839
they have a structure

1410
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,359
because they are used for specific

1411
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:42,319
purpose then for routing messages to

1412
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:43,200
um

1413
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,559
to the home

1414
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,160
home in quotes

1415
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,119
uh so so we plan to add um identifiers

1416
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,400
there and uh

1417
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,880
like if you have any preference on what

1418
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,200
examples i'm to provide

1419
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,720
that would obviously be helpful because

1420
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,520
there's a long list of them

1421
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,680
and we don't want to be sort of

1422
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,319
exhaustive there by any means

1423
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:06,960
but i think it's also a recognition that

1424
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,960
any sort of efforts to

1425
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,440
agree on one specific identifier is kind

1426
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,960
of a little bit uh

1427
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,280
um a losing ground

1428
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,839
at least from what i can see sorry you

1429
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:18,640
have

1430
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,839
only one minute left oh okay my

1431
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:24,799
presentation okay uh yep uh do i have

1432
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:27,520
one more slide

1433
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:28,559
no

1434
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,960
okay cool okay

1435
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,040
yeah if there's enough feedback well my

1436
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,160
question

1437
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,079
i have a question regarding this the

1438
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,920
last slide so

1439
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,880
uh

1440
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,400
is there any

1441
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,599
connection between the work that

1442
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:46,040
rich is doing with

1443
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,839
6125b which is also about

1444
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:51,200
naming a

1445
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,040
connection between certificates naming

1446
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,559
certificates and we still s and

1447
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,319
this

1448
00:58:58,319 --> 00:58:59,280
work

1449
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,359
yeah i see his um

1450
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:04,480
the relationship in the sense that um

1451
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,799
he's talking about the server side um if

1452
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:08,640
i if i understood that correctly and i

1453
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,440
think that's quite important um to also

1454
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,359
i'm i think referencing that work and

1455
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:16,079
and you should definitely do that um

1456
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:18,720
and and and the client side i don't

1457
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,839
think we can make the same

1458
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,160
recommendations on the client set as we

1459
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,319
do on the server on the server side

1460
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:26,160
because um they're just different

1461
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,920
requirements um

1462
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,799
and not just only like the way how the

1463
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:34,079
authorization works um for for the so

1464
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:35,839
for what you get from the server to

1465
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,839
match it up for example match the sni

1466
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,839
with uh what you get from the service

1467
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:43,119
certificate um the the authorization is

1468
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:45,280
very different on an iod

1469
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,319
um in an iot deployment from the client

1470
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:49,760
side um

1471
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,000
to the server or to multiple servers if

1472
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,400
you have something like anima

1473
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,079
so so there's some

1474
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:57,520
um

1475
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,599
difference and it's probably in in the

1476
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,119
end like if you see it from a from a

1477
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:02,319
high level of course there's a little

1478
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,319
bit of annoyance on the server side

1479
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:05,359
because you now need to look at

1480
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:06,960
different places uh

1481
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,520
for the identifiers rather than in one

1482
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,160
specific but um

1483
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:16,079
on on the other hand um like for most

1484
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,520
for most deployments it's it's um

1485
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,920
it doesn't matter that much there's no

1486
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,480
sort of like intro ability problem uh i

1487
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,720
think the intro ability issue of

1488
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,720
identify matching and identify against

1489
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,680
something else that occurs in in

1490
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:32,640
in

1491
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,440
fewer places like like anima or

1492
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,359
maybe maybe some other protocols that

1493
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:38,960
work similarly okay

1494
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,599
thank you i think that reference

1495
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,119
61 25 bc is a good idea anyway

1496
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:47,359
and

1497
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,640
we are running out of time it's

1498
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,160
our time is over and i think we've just

1499
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,760
we've just

1500
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,119
are able to

1501
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,319
finish our agenda just in time

1502
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:01,520
and

1503
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,280
thank you very much for everybody who

1504
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,559
attended

1505
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:05,280
and

1506
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,559
[Music]

1507
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:09,680
hope to see you in person next time

1508
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,520
if it is possible

1509
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:16,480
and so have a nice rest of day

1510
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:21,759
goodbye

1511
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,400
thank you all goodbye

1512
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,480
you
