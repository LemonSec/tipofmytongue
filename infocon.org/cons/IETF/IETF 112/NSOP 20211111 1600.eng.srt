54
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,280
con feedback is still open so please go

55

57
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,599
um

58
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,200
it's a good thing there's some folks in

59
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,800
dns pretty regularly that are running

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,360
for a few positions so

61
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,280
you know we always like that

62
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,440
um on another note

63
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,000
kim davies has a document about moving

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,879
some

65
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,480
stuff in in int to historic and

66
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,920
um he's i think this has been socialized

67
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,400
in dns but also through the orc list

68
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,760
and warren's offered to ad sponsor it um

69
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,560
and

70
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,640
um if if you all want to take a read at

71
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,159
it and you know it's pretty

72
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,360
straightforward it's simple clean

73
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,120
straightforward we should be in good

74
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,599
shape but thanks kim for working on that

75
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,760
um he also promised to publish the zone

76
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,680
after he's got all this cleaned up so

77
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,599
um i like that i don't know why but i

78
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,239
like that um

79
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,439
you know that we haven't actually

80
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,159
adopted work in a while um

81
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,239
and we've talked about this and warren's

82
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,920
talked about this with us and

83
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,720
we're

84
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,040
you know we had some ideas but then it

85
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,560
was like maybe we should just have a

86
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,480
poll and have the working group sort of

87
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,640
chime in on this because you know

88
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,040
everybody loves a good poll right so

89
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,280
we're putting something together

90
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,199
probably in the next week or so

91
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,358
and we've had we've had good success

92
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,680
with our focus in terms um you know

93
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,759
feedback from the authors as well as as

94
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,199
other folks and so we're going to

95
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,759
continue doing that on you know just one

96
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,440
or two documents and then you know do an

97
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,960
hour one or two documents really get

98
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,240
people sort of thinking about that so um

99
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,320
if you've got adopt a doc a document

100
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,800
that's adopted and you'd like to sort of

101
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,280
sign up for one just drop us a note

102
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,280
we will reach out to folks but if you

103
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,880
want to sort of push yourself to the

104
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,600
head of the list you know a good

105
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,360
a good email to us kind of move us along

106
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,880
i think

107
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,240
so thanks

108
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,000
next slide

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,960
um

110
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,360
which and this is just some you know um

111
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,639
warren's like let's put the pretty

112
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,880
picture back in there um so we put the

113
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,120
pretty picture from last time about

114
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,560
the active working group documents and

115
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,840
what people feel is important or not

116
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,520
important um

117
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,560
so

118
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,840
there you go we've got you a pretty

119
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,240
picture and we think it's pretty good so

120
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,440
um next slide

121
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,960
and just and also as a follow-up from

122
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,280
some of the working group poll

123
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,039
from you know july

124
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,400
two of the documents that were really

125
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,919
suggested um by the folks were the

126
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,280
unisex bootstrapping and the united

127
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,039
states automation which are both going

128
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,199
to be discussed and we both think are

129
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,440
very you know we would love to see the

130
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,360
working group sort of coalesce around

131
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,039
some of that and

132
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,960
also on the some of the new group beings

133
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,199
new work being suggested suggested is

134
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,199
the 8109 biz which

135
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,440
we i believe we felt like we wanted to

136
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,680
adopt at one point and we sort of

137
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,000
um lost it in the shuffle so we're

138
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,680
guilty the chairs are guilty of that or

139
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,319
i'm guilty of that um and i think what

140
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,000
will happen is

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,759
if once we start adopting work the biz

142
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,440
documents will probably will

143
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,919
filter up to the top first um it's

144
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,880
probably the correct way to say that um

145
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,400
and warren can sort of speak on that if

146
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,759
he wants to any way shape or form um

147
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,520
so a next slide

148
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,800
what else are we talking about here so

149
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,400
some document updates

150
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,680
um

151
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,400
we've got two documents um

152
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,360
in the rfc status 7816 biz is it's in

153
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,240
the

154
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,680
editor thing but they've assigned a

155
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
number i consider it done

156
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,560
um

157
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,360
so

158
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,479
that's really great and thanks to the

159
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,479
authors for sort of getting all the work

160
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,880
involved on that thanks and and on the

161
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,240
next slide

162
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,080
we've got

163
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,479
three other documents that

164
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,199
one in the editor queue my consideration

165
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,600
um and then two that are going through

166
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,400
the ihd evaluation and they both are

167
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,240
getting lots of good comments and

168
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
feedback and um

169
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,000
we're those are being moved along as

170
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,560
well in a very you know process sort of

171
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,680
way so

172
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
those those things are

173
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,880
happening and that's great thanks for

174
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,560
the authors on sort of following up on a

175
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,039
lot of those and also almost done we

176
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,639
feel when we were sort of discussing

177
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,759
this this week

178
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,759
blue is not optional

179
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,560
um

180
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,160
i think there's one or two outstanding

181
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,759
there's like one outstanding item and

182
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,280
once we sort of

183
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,960
clear some of that up i think we're

184
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,479
ready for that one

185
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,400
as well as avoid fragmentation some of i

186
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
think there's some editorial work

187
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,639
um we want to help

188
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,639
on sort of clearing some of the

189
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,440
fragmentation bits up

190
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,360
and also catalog zones which um will and

191
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,599
we'll talk about tomorrow um due to his

192
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,160
timing um phil's feels is basically done

193
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,319
as well um they've had some good

194
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,400
hackathon results as well

195
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,280
um also the feedback from the interim on

196
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,879
dns error reporting rory's got some

197
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,479
great feedback and he's working to

198
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,599
integrate all that and um

199
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,319
we've our our view of it is it's it's in

200
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,759
really good shape and ready to go so

201
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,440
that was really great so

202
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,879
i know people thought that was kind of a

203
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,039
strange interim item but we got a lot of

204
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,720
operational stuff right in there and

205
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,199
that was pretty great um

206
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,039
the rr serial document i

207
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,400
i know hugo is working on some

208
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,080
implementation stuff i and i see him in

209
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,720
the audience um maybe we should do that

210
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,639
as an interim topic um that's been one

211
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,319
that's sort of been you know sitting on

212
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,319
my like

213
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,639
we owe we owe that the drafts and works

214
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,400
or some effort sort of thing

215
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,240
um

216
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,479
so and then

217
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,400
the as because i in a consideration is

218
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,639
basically in the editor queue

219
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,159
and considered done

220
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,479
5933 33 biz

221
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,919
um

222
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,679
was on hold we chatted it out and um

223
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,320
what we we came up with and we'll see

224
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,159
what happens during the working group is

225
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,760
changing it to informational and then

226
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,200
we'll proceed with a working group last

227
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,080
call

228
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,519
probably starting

229
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,880
this weekend

230
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,600
and

231
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,680
you know we expect

232
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,519
all you know we expect everything from

233
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,760
that so um but thanks to the authors for

234
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,040
being patient and i do think

235
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,080
you know

236
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,440
paul's work on sort of cleaning up some

237
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,040
of the the ionos stuff actually is

238
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,279

239
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,279
thank you paul

240
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,839
next slide

241
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,600
and of course our stuff is in the data

242
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,959
tracker um

243
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,880
we're shortening our list

244
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,760
um

245
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,680
and we feel that

246
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,600
as we sort of get get the list down a

247
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,680
little bit more that um we'll start

248
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,839
adopting stuff and

249
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,160
we'll work you know

250
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,320
we've been discussing numbers you know

251
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
like how you know how many exact drafts

252
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,959
can we do but i think we're taking it on

253
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,600
a you know

254
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,640
we'll we'll take guidance from the

255
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,080
working group and from warren on the

256
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,920
best way to do that so

257
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,839
um

258
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,600
so thanks and we keep it all on github

259
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,640
as well

260
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,720
and i think okay so let's cruise over to

261
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,560
the agenda let's i think that's the next

262
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,720
one yep one more

263
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,920
um

264
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,000
the recurrent business is the nsac3

265
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,399
parameter setting wes

266
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,080
you know i think there's a great email

267
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,320
thread about what number to use and i

268
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,519
love whenever he kept saying let's just

269
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,079
make it zero um but wes is going to give

270
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,120
us a great

271
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,040
uh little overview on that so next slide

272
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,760
and don't take this as quote unquote new

273
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,079
business um and you can bash this as you

274
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,440
see it's more

275
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,120
updates or documents that people have

276
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,600
sort of wanted to sort of talk about um

277
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,200
whether or not we adopt it is sort of

278
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,720
you know that's always a bigger

279
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,959
discussion right but we call it new

280
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,720
business because it's it's not sort of

281
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,440
adopted work so i apologize i think the

282
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,279
wording is probably bad there

283
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,480
um

284
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,880
we've got dnsec automation um siobhan

285
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,240
and schumann's document on domain

286
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,320
verification techniques the structured

287
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,279
error page bit and brian dixon who did

288
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,200
the talk in deprived we've chatted with

289
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,360
him he's revised his slide so he's got a

290
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,959
different slide deck

291
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,519
and um we're hope you know we believe

292
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,880
and he's going to provide better

293
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,959
motivation upfront about what he's

294
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,360
trying to solve here and i think

295
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,240
you know

296
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,760
hopefully a sort of streamlined

297
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,360
discussion so we so there can be

298
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,000
comments because we know we were

299
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,079
even with 20 minutes or so we kind of

300
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,040
ran out of time and deprived so we're

301
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
hoping to sort of help brian along by

302
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,079
you know

303
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,880
moving that shortening that up um

304
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
thanks and i think what what else is

305
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,920
going on

306
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,880
um

307
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,399
i think that's it so that's that's

308
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,480
tomorrow's business so that's kind of

309
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,240
ours if anybody has sort of agenda

310
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,920
bashing they like or don't like what

311
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,200
we're doing um please speak up

312
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,040
you know or

313
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
adopting new work not adopting new work

314
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
what we're not focusing on we really

315
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,440
would like to hear that um i know you

316
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,279

317
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,320
of us we

318
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,079
were all in agreement that we'd like to

319
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,519
hear

320
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,079
from the working group you know

321
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,399
what what can be more efficient it's a

322
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,120
good way to put it

323
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,200
tim i just i'm monitoring the the chat

324
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,760
room okay and hugo just

325
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,720
sent a

326
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,839
message that about our serial i planned

327
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,560
some minor updates before expiration

328
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,880

329
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,000
so that's a great i appreciate we

330

you know

333
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,800
internal ideas or things of that nature

334
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,680
so

335
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,800
we just didn't want to feel that you

336
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,760
were being ignored hugo

337
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,240
um

338
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,639
so yeah okay then i i think i'm done

339
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,320
unless people want to

340
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,399
raise their voice which i welcome them

341
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,040
to do otherwise we can move along to mr

342
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,200
hartiger

343
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,279
yes

344
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,800
i will stop sharing

345
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,839
thank you wes

346
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,360
wes do you want to run your slides

347
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,680
yourself or shall i uh

348
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,639
yeah that's okay i can do them um yeah

349
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,040
either way but just make sure it's the

350
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,519
most recent set yep they did send a

351
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,200
sharing request yeah uh

352
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,279
grand screen so there you go

353
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,399
okay

354
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,800
uh so i hope everybody else doesn't have

355
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,480
a headache like i do

356
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,720
um so if i feel a little if i sound

357
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,120
weird that's probably why um this is the

358
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,279
dns atf dnsop uh insect three iterations

359
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,839
draft by myself and victor duke company

360
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,160
um i pulled it out of the oven i put the

361
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,720
toothpick in it it is so close to to

362
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,279
being ready to uh to serve

363
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,079
um

364
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,440
so

365
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,040
really we're down to like one point

366
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,959
which is what we'll discuss today but

367
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,720
just as a reminder sort of the current

368
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,560
you know the point of the draft is to

369
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,959
say things like use nsec if you can

370
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,519
you should you know ideally use zero as

371
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,320
a iterations count and you know use

372
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,600
assault only if you're going to change

373
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,199
it and

374
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,320
this is the current draft table of you

375
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,800
know what validators and stuff should do

376
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,760
i'm not going to go over it because

377
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,720
we're going to change today

378
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,959
victor in his

379
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,680
massive scanning of over 12 million

380
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,240
domains that are have insect deployed

381
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,720
insect three deployed um

382
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,519
uh

383
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,519
actually that's an increase from from

384
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,040
the last time he measured which was the

385
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,600
last time i reported in july

386
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,279
so now there's 12 000 and you can see

387
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,519
the fractions of the number of zones

388
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,600
that are at various different values of

389
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,320
iteration counts on the left-hand side

390
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,120
um i did put you know the five nines in

391
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,360
bold so i mean the good news is for 500

392
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,839
we're we're at five nines under that um

393
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,000
but but even then you can see that there

394
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,320
is a decent fall off and and even ninety

395
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,920
nine percent of

396
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,399
enzo iii zones in the world today are

397
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,680
under 20 or under or equal to 20. uh

398
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,680
there is a break at zero and one and i

399
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,839
think zero and one is is one of the most

400
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,839
confusing points i didn't put one on the

401
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,440
slide but there's a decent jump from

402
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,920
zero to one um and you know like most

403
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,360
people think oh well i want one

404
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,519
iteration um well no it's for one

405
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,560
iteration you actually have to set a

406
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,600
value of zero and i think that's

407
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,000
confused people

408
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,680
um so

409
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,519
the remaining outstanding question is

410
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,519
what should we set as the lower limit

411
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,320
for

412
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,120
for

413
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
validators and zone owners to actually

414
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,079
use um the previous draft had 150 the

415
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,480
current draft has a hundred and then as

416
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,800
a mail message i put on the on the

417
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,720
dinosaurs the other day was trying to

418
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,480
see discussion around okay well what

419
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,800
could we do uh recently four

420
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,959
implementations uh you know have said

421
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,120
they've in their announcement text have

422
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,480
said that you know they're capping it at

423
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,440
150. since the discussion the other day

424
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,279
two more have promised to go down to a

425
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,839
hundred and then you might want to mute

426
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:50,880
your mic you have a little bit of

427
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,399
background feeding

428
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,680
excuse me

429
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,000
yep no problem so this is the final

430
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,120
slide and so this is what i think if i

431
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,040
summarize the conversation in the past

432
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,079
week for

433
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,040
uh for dns up on the mailing list where

434
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,120
we ended up so the important thing to

435
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,000
note is one most dns participants really

436
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,440
want zero it's just a question of

437
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,920
whether we can state that or not

438
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,560
um so i think you know i was out walking

439
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,600
around the other day and i said you know

440
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,360
the right way to handle this was with

441
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,440
should mace musts and that type of stuff

442
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,399
and then

443
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,000
multiple people actually started saying

444
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,279
the same thing on the on the mailing

445
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,120
list so that actually works well

446
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,360
so i think this is what we we might want

447
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,279
to say and so what i really want to hear

448
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,800
from today is

449
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,120
people that disagree with anything on

450
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,480
this slide so

451
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,920
to read it out

452
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,800
you know you should use uh validators

453
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,880
should treat iterations greater than

454
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,560
zero as insecure

455
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,959
and that is a bold change from where we

456
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,800
are right um you sh you may treat you

457
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,120
know iterations of one as

458
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,880
uh you actually may that's that second

459
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,720
line is wrong it should be you may treat

460
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,639
iterations of one and you may want to

461
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,839
validate it

462
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,600
and and don't treat it as insecure

463
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,000
because because of that one number that

464
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,679
is out and so prevalent that only seven

465
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,599
percent of the the existing zones out

466
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,679
there are using zero

467
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,079
you must treat iterations greater than

468
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,000
100 as insecure

469
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,400
and you may treat iterations greater

470
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
than 500 is serve fail and remember that

471
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,160
was something that we decided as an

472
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,839
optional thing people don't have to do

473
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,160
it uh they can just continue treating

474
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,919
things as insecure and some

475
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,919
implementations you know may want to

476
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,760
return serve fail if they want to be a

477
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,039
little more aggressive and really

478
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,679
yelling at people that don't do that

479
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,600
and then you know for the zone owner

480
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,520
side of things you know

481
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,280
whether whether you're an operator

482
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,720
that's managing a zone on behalf of

483
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,760
somebody else or whether you're actually

484
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,840
controlling the iterations yourself

485
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,320
you should use an iterations count of 0

486
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,160
and you must use an iterations count of

487
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,320
less than or equal to 100 you know which

488
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,720
again matches the must up here so these

489
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,160
two values should always stay in lock

490
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
step

491
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,120
so

492
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,640
what i am done talking and we may get 15

493
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,039
minutes back if nobody has you know

494
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,000
issues with this particular proposal

495
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,840
but of course we have people with issues

496
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,200
with this particular proposal so we'll

497
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,600
start with victor

498
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,520
victor you can unmute and

499
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,520
go

500
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,559
while we're waiting for victor

501
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,120
ted do you want to try

502
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,840
ted lemon ted

503
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,720
um

504
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,480
so uh thanks for doing this it's really

505
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,400
great work and i totally support it i do

506
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,880
have one question which is uh the choice

507
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,440
of insecure versus uh

508
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,360
well so the the text actually says

509
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,520
insecure but but i'm wondering if

510
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,960
there's a difference in behavior that

511
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,120
might be appropriate for validating stub

512
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,520
resolver as opposed to a validating

513
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,039
caching resolver

514
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,000
um

515
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,200
and

516
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,799
i i don't actually know the answer to

517
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,039
this but but like my instinct is that

518
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,160
the stub resolver should treat um

519
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,600
an iteration of greater than 100

520
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,080
essentially is an attack and punish it

521
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,960
by

522
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,600
failing to resolve the result

523
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,640
in other words it should treat it as

524
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,039
bogus rather than as insecure because

525
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,679
insecure isn't really accurate

526
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,640
but that's just my sort of

527
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,960
my instinctual reaction i don't know

528
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,400
that that's the correct reaction i'm

529
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,960
just curious what you think of that

530
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,039
well i i hit i that that's a good

531
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,559
question so i mean i should we should

532
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,160
hear from other people my my gut

533
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,679
reaction on

534
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,039
splitting what type of uh resolver it is

535
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,520
you know leads to problems and you know

536
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,440
camels and things like that of we should

537
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,360
just have everything do the same

538
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,559
um the reason for doing insecure versus

539
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,240
uh you know serve fail essentially or

540
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,559
failing to to resolve it all is it

541
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,160
actually matches what insect three does

542
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,400
today um so the insect three draft says

543
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,760
if you're using something greater than

544
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,240
4096 i mean the values are just huge you

545
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,159
know just treat it as insecure so

546
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,320
there's precedence for for

547
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,080
that is really what it came down to and

548
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,440
you're still trying to do the end goal

549
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,480
of of

550
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,159
helping actually do a resolution even if

551
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,240
you can't prove that i remember this is

552
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,039
for proof of non-existence right

553
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,559
so uh it it's uh it's

554
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,720
you'd still return an nx domain uh you

555
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,320
just wouldn't you know be able to verify

556
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,280
it

557
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,480
right

558
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,280
thanks

559
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,080
uh victor do you want to try again

560
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,799
figured out where the mute is

561
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,039
all right so a couple of things one i

562
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,919
don't know if everybody realizes but

563
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,120
when we

564
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,159
treat high duration counts as insecure

565
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,039
the entire zone essentially becomes

566
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,840
insecure it's not just the negative

567
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,360
answers it's that one because one can

568
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,600
then forge delegations

569
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,840
every answer in the zone can is then

570
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,320
subject to man in the middle uh attack

571
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,080
if you get an answer with a valid

572
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,400
signature sure you can trust it but you

573
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,320
might have gotten an unsigned answer and

574
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,720
trusted that instead

575
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,919
so it's a very marginally secure zone at

576
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,679
that point essentially no answer is

577
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,559
secure if a tld were to go you know

578
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,360
above the iteration limit then all of

579
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,039
its child zones become completely

580
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,880
insecure

581
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,960
so this is pretty drastic

582
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,520
the other comment is

583
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,080
in terms of the gap between

584
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,280
uh insecure and sir fail

585
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,240
surfmail does have the advantage that it

586
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,120
preserves the security of the zone right

587
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,480
you know they

588
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,840
uh

589
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,640
they don't ever go insecure all right if

590
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,480
they screw up they get to find out about

591
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,880
it and then ideally fix it

592
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
so it would be ideally nice to keep that

593
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,600
range small maybe even not have insecure

594
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,159
fall back but of course in practice

595
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,760
uh if

596
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,120
you know on the ground not enough

597
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,280
domains get the message and some people

598
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,200
you know are happy enough to operate in

599
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,720
this gray zone

600
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,080
where they think they're secure but

601
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,200
they're not

602
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,440
uh rather than serve fail we can you

603
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,120
know let them be that way so i don't

604
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,799
know what the answer is

605
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,559
but just for clarity

606
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,600
uh

607
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,240
insecure is very insecure uh you you

608
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,320
have no security once you're over the

609
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,480
limits

610
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,640
thanks for the clarification victor uh

611
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
jim

612
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,799
uh chairs you might want to cut the key

613
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,240
or decide when you want to do that based

614
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,640
on time i'm not watching time

615
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,880
jim thanks hope you can hear me now i

616
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,919
was having problems earlier today

617
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,919
great stuff um i pretty much agree with

618
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,240
what ted was saying before i think we

619
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,760
probably need to look at the validation

620
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,559
side is not having this flag is insecure

621
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,080
middle ground

622
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,320
in my view either a zone is secure or

623
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,919
it's not secure

624
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,080
and i think it's better to return surf

625
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,240
fail if the number of iterations is too

626
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,039
high

627
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,880
and also the point that victor was just

628
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,679
making about the potential for denial of

629
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,440
the service attacks of spoofing attacks

630
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
if the zone is accidentally mapped as

631
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,559
insecure

632
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,320
and it's not quite there

633
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,559
so i i would prefer not to do

634
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,720
this insecure middle ground and just

635
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,760
take a very big view of it either the

636
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,360
zone is secure or it's not there's

637
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,960
nothing in between

638
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,440
okay so you essentially want a serve

639
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,799
fail for

640
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,080
greater than

641
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,039
zero or one correct yes

642
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,080
okay

643
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,919
um

644
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,440
okay

645
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,400
uh we'll go on

646
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,799
ralph having a kind of middle ground can

647
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,600
cause problems so i would also prefer

648
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,159
one one signal and i think in early

649
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,279
discussions we we thought about uh

650
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,720
um doing the surface at 100 150

651
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,520
so

652
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,520
that as a starting point because the

653
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,360
problem now if you have a resolver that

654
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,400
wants to

655
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,320
do the kind of hard cut

656
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,120
it cannot comply to this graph because

657
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,720
the current uh graph the must is at 100

658
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,080
so between 100 and 150 bears or 500 in

659
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,520
that case

660
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,600
there is a

661
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,760
behavior that

662
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,840
is currently not possible if you want to

663
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,120
just have really hard cut

664
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,240
thanks you actually bring up another

665
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,440
point that i meant to mention which i

666
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,120
haven't which is that

667
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,039
there was discussion on the list that we

668
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,159
should produce this rfc with the goal

669
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,400
uh with the goal being zero um i think

670
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
there's general consensus around that

671
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,200
um and allow validators to slowly

672
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,679
achieve that based on measurements by

673
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,919
you know victor or others in terms of

674
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,000
what actually happens in the world so

675
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,600
you know functionally be non-compliant

676
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,360
to the rfc when it comes out you know

677
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,799
and wait for for a time a fall-off time

678
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,640
uh and then get to serve fail or

679
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,279
something like that

680
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,039
okay uh thanks

681
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,760
hi can you hear me

682
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,880
yes

683
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,760
okay good uh i was the one who was

684
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,480
proposing to specify the goal and you

685
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,360
know let people slowly approach that

686
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,279
goal and

687
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,440
i think that for the zone owners the the

688
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,960
rfc

689
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,080
should

690
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,120
be just must less than one or

691
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,440
zero or one or something like that

692
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,520
because that's the only interoperable

693
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,559
value in the long term and i don't think

694
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,600
it's useful to update the rfc in you

695
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,200
know in a year or two so i think that

696
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,840
we should be very strict for

697
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,520
zoners and we can be much more relaxed

698
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,600
in the specification for the validators

699
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,799
because

700
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,880
we don't even specify the value for

701
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,279
validators it can be just you know think

702
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,440
about the value before you release your

703
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,080
software and do your measurements

704
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,279
because for validators

705
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,039
it's

706
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,120
basically impossible to prescribe the

707
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,200
value because it's changing all the time

708
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,760
but for zone owners we can specify what

709
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,960
they has to do to be interoperable in

710
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,320
the long term

711
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,120
in my view we don't need to like refine

712
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,440
details

713
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,000
okay do you make any sense yeah it does

714
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,760
uh thanks do you have an opinion on the

715
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,760
serve fail aspect of whether it should

716
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,159
be a low value or something like it is

717
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,559
now with whether insecure or not is

718
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,440
yeah i'm afraid it's it is same

719
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,760
same story because right now we cannot

720
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,200
do say fell

721
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,640
above certain

722
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,720
point but it will change over time so

723
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,480
again i would

724
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,559
just describe for validators what needs

725
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,480
to be considered

726
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,640
when the validator vendor is setting the

727
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,279
thresholds but we i don't think we have

728
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,360
to specify the values in the draft

729
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,159
actually because we describe the logic

730
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,559
they well if you

731
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,400
you know the current prevalence of

732
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,320
iteration values you will see

733
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,480
distribution and then you know make up

734
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,799
your mind and these are the consequences

735
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,360
of your decisions i mean

736
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,760
if you describe that insecure

737
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,840
means actually

738
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,320
not just for the nx domain

739
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,720
and the desire file has better security

740
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,480
properties then i think it's enough in

741
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,240
the draft for the

742
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,559
data vendors to decide

743
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,320
okay all right thank you

744
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,200
all right chairs i will uh take all that

745
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,720
input and

746
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,880
do something with it i think we uh there

747
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,159
will certainly be more commas on the

748
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,399
list

749
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,159
okay

750
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,559
thank you thank you wes

751
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,559
um

752
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,000
yeah

753
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,720
so

754
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,080
uh indeed yeah no uh speaking now as a

755
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,919
as an implementer

756
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,720
i uh i agree with better

757
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,000
uh also for for uh well

758
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,919
and and also i want to know that

759
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,240
the surveil behavior is new the other

760
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,520
are

761
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,399
caps

762
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,120
caps on iterations the serve file is new

763
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
and i think yeah

764
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,240
we will follow the drafts

765
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,120
and

766
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,640
the rfc

767
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,240
and

768
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,480
also of course

769
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,840
thank you

770
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,919
victor for measuring

771
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,520
the current state

772
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,760
of the number of insect iterations being

773
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,760
used by operators

774
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,799
um

775
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,120
okay

776
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,320
i want to go to the next presentation

777
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,440
let's see

778
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,840
where are we here that's um

779
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,679
there you are

780
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:40,880
um

781
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,000
what do you want

782
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,080
you want to run the slides you can ask

783
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,200
uh

784
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,520
to run the slides there's a new option

785
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,720
here there we are yeah

786
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,960
granted

787
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,640
can you hear me actually

788
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,080
yes

789
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,880
good i i have intermittent failure so i

790
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,440
have actually uh

791
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,760
okay

792
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,679
okay

793
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,039
this seems to work

794
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,880
good hello i'm always from the swiss

795
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,039
internet foundation and this is work

796
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,880
that we actually had a whole group of

797
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,919
doing but

798
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,840
schumann started this with his

799
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,080
multi-signer

800
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,320
document a few years back

801
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,399
and so um

802
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,960
we have presented this work at

803
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,480
its before

804
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,279
and we have be continuing working on it

805
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,240
and

806
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,440
so i was

807
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,399
going to do doing an up status update uh

808
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,919
where we are in the work

809
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,000
and so we have um

810
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,640
the algorithms are for leaving for

811
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,399
joining and leaving a multi-silo group

812
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,600
is defined

813
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,080
uh we have algorithms defined for

814
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,440
keyword overs of a whole group of

815
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,960
signers

816
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
we are working on a

817
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,399
controller software that can orchestrate

818
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,880
the whole multisigner setup

819
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,360
joining

820
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,960
leaving

821
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,840
algorithm rollo or key rollovers

822
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,880
and uh one of the um

823
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,120
missing pieces for this to be really

824
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,200
automated is that the parent zone would

825
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,000
have to uh support season

826
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,520
and this is actually what we have been

827
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,200
doing in the swedish internet foundation

828
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,600
we are implementing season scanning

829
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,640
uh we started with cds cdns key scanning

830
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,000
last month

831
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,320
and we will start with ceasing scanning

832
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,440
hopefully next month before christmas

833
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,330
and let's see

834
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,039
[Music]

835
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,159
we can

836
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,600
with this yes

837
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,559
okay so what do we have left to do

838
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,840
um

839
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,279
obviously we

840
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,440
this we have written up the all the

841
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,559
algorithms

842
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,559
but we have not made real world

843
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,679
verification and we try will do this

844
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,799
with our software implementation and we

845
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,120
hope to do this between this itf and the

846
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,480
next one

847
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,440
and

848
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,240
then we will have to make more stringent

849
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,320
timing definitions and

850
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,399
there's a lot of

851
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,840
dependencies on ttls and timeouts and i

852
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,840
think we need to be a little bit more

853
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,159
yeah stringent on what these timing

854
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,519
definitions are

855
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,720
and

856
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,799
i think that is my part

857
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,080
let's see

858
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,480
yes

859
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,279
okay um yes and so this was added by

860
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,519
schumann but i think i can speak to this

861
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,760
uh too okay we

862
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,399
if you're following the the icam process

863
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,720
we there is a dns

864
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,919
day basically at the the ik meetings

865
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,760
and there is a

866
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,240
small on the dns day there is a dns

867
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,960
automation panel that

868
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,720
steve crocker has been running together

869
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,919
with schumann

870
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,480
and there's a lot of work around the

871
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,679
dnsec automation there was an uh

872
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,240
workshop of the rsec

873
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,919
the

874
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,440
committee

875
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,240
of icann about the nsa automation so

876
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,559
there's a lot of movement around this

877
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,679
and

878
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:16,799
i think

879
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,360
yeah so this work that is really

880
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,720
looked at other than in other places

881
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,440
and um

882
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,600
yes before i come to this uh uh what i

883
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,760
do wanted to say that there

884
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,840
that we have been working

885
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,760
on a way to

886
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,000
so one of the the special use cases of

887
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,519
this multisigner is to take a domain and

888
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,120
move it from one

889
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,240
signing dns provide a dns provider to

890
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,960
another signing dns provider

891
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,320
and

892
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,799
one of the

893
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,320
requirements is that bose have the same

894
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,679
algorithm

895
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:58,880
and

896
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,240
but

897
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,000
and this is of course doable for large

898
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,679
organizations because then you can pay

899
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,039
for it and you can you know make

900
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,600
requirements to your service providers

901
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,240
but if you are your person but it's your

902
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,000
personal domain you probably can't do

903
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,840
that and uh

904
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,919
registrars or other

905
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,559
you know hosting providers are not very

906
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,640
uh open to making changes to their

907
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,200
environment for just your domain so what

908
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,399
we in practice would like to do is to

909
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,480
make to be able to move a domain from

910
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,960
one signer to another sinai

911
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,880
but they have different algorithms for

912
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,840
signing

913
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,960
and

914
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,840
this will need some additional work and

915
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,490
we will have to go back to

916
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,640
[Music]

917
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,519
how dns egg is validated actually and

918
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,840
see what we can do there to you know

919
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,200
make this work

920
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,399
and um

921
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,640
so this will be future work after we

922
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,000
have this

923
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,840
the first one

924
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,880
finished and um yes so and we would like

925
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,559
to ask the working group for adoption

926
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,720
for this work so that we um yes get this

927
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,600
documented and defined how to move your

928
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,918
domains around and how to run them in

929
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,280
this

930
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,040
more resilient setup of multisign

931
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,359
thank you

932
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,719
and schumann

933
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,639
you're muted schumann

934
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,320
i can't hear you

935
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,719
can you hear me now yeah

936
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,280
okay great sorry i had to click an extra

937
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,480
button

938
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,079
uh so i just wanted to say that working

939
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,679
on this draft has helped us to talk with

940
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,159
implementers and manage dns providers

941
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,679
alike to

942
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,520
implement the key management interfaces

943
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,680
that allow multi-signer operation to

944
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,040
work smoothly

945
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,359
and that in turn

946
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,280
helps us solve the inter-provider

947
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,839
handoff uh smoothly as well so i think

948
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,200
we think there's good benefit to the

949
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,280
operational dns community

950
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,400
generally so we would encourage

951
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,960
the working group to consider adopting

952
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,839
this drug

953
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,520
thank you uh thank you schumann

954
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,200
um yeah

955
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,480
as

956
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,400
tim already presented at the start

957
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,560
you are on the shortlist for for working

958
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,320
group adoption

959
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,040
uh and we will start uh start the

960
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,040
process after uh

961
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,079
well next week but again we uh we

962
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,839
discussed the sponsor with the dinosaur

963
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,400
chairs and the ad

964
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,200
but we

965
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,200
idly we we see about four or five

966
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,760
active drafts in the working group and

967
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,280
active not being in the isgq or editor

968
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,760
queue or on hold

969
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,000
we're close to that

970
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,040
with the current state of the document

971
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,720
so we're open for

972
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,560
adopting new work and

973
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,240
as tim presented on this slide your

974
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,520
draft is also on this list

975
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,400
thank you

976
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,599
yeah

977
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,920
paul

978
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,960
please go ahead greetings so this

979
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,079
follows up on schumann's question um

980
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,560
does this have to be in dns op

981
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,160
and the reason i ask is this

982
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,280
we

983
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,920
yes it obviously relates to operations

984
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,280
but it really relates to

985
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,320
horrors and how operators hand things

986
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,680
off and such

987
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,000
i could completely see this being in a

988
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,400
different working group that is much

989
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,200
more

990
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,880
operator

991
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,880
oriented than protocol oriented um

992
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,160
from what uri said i think the issues

993
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,560
that are open that are are you know

994
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,400
will be dealable with but i think need

995
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,720
to be discussed are really not ones that

996
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,160
we are necessarily experts at in dns op

997
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,720
and so i could see a

998
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,680
purpose-specific group um

999
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,880
that is about how do operators work with

1000
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,839
each other when doing handoffs and have

1001
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,480
this be part of that not saying it

1002
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,359
shouldn't be in dns off but i'm not sure

1003
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,920
that it needs to be in the same queue

1004
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,720
with lots of other things that we are

1005
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,720
doing that are much more

1006
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,079
protocol focused than operator focused

1007
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,079
just a thought

1008
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,480
thank you

1009
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,240
noted

1010
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,800
um so uric do you want to run the queue

1011
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,960
yourself or shall i uh call for the next

1012
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,200
oh please we continue with peter

1013
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,960
yep

1014
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,000
okay

1015
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,040
um paul just said that most of the

1016
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,119
proposal concerns dns operators only and

1017
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,560
not the protocol

1018
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,839
and i wanted to point out i don't know

1019
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,000
if it's in the draft that there may be a

1020
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,920
protocol implication

1021
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,400
in case of key rollovers

1022
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,680
or key algorithm rollovers um

1023
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,119
i don't remember exactly what the

1024
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,880
circumstance was maybe schumann or if

1025
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,320
you know but wasn't there some

1026
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,760
requirement that you have to have

1027
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,720
signatures um oh yeah i remember if you

1028
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,040
have two providers um they have to sign

1029
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,119
the dnsk record set on each side with

1030
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,400
their respective keys and if one

1031
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,160
provider decides to to change the

1032
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,200
algorithm

1033
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,000
then

1034
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,359
the

1035
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,119
the other doesn't use the new algorithm

1036
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,720
and can't sign the dns key records

1037
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,560
appropriately and i think that

1038
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,079
requirement um

1039
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,000
comes from some dns rfc i don't have the

1040
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,280
section in my head

1041
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,000
and um i remember there was some

1042
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,760
kind of complication like that so maybe

1043
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,079
there is a protocol implement um

1044
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,359
a protocol

1045
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,720
implication

1046
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,760
just

1047
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,480
putting it out there

1048
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,160
okay thank you peter

1049
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,359
golf weber would you okay so there was a

1050
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,480
time

1051
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,599
um when there was dns x that cared for

1052
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,520
protocol and dns up that cared for

1053
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,160
operations and then dns up started to do

1054
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,240
well we would do it all together

1055
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,400
but i think that

1056
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,320
this is exactly the work that belongs in

1057
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,640
dns up and i very much would encourage

1058
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,720
to work to take that work up and adopt

1059
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,040
the crowd

1060
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,839
thank you ron

1061
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,560
and victor

1062
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,359
i also think that sorry i also think

1063
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,160
that

1064
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,560
implementers of of name servers not

1065
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,640
necessarily operators

1066
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,640
probably need to make software changes

1067
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,800
to support this work

1068
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,040
and so exposure in this working group

1069
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,280
where the right people pay attention i

1070
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,160
think is appropriate

1071
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,920
thank you yes um to this point i can say

1072
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,040
that yes

1073
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,400
we are doing this

1074
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,560
we implementing this controller software

1075
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,119
right now and um there is actually a

1076
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,400
quite

1077
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,040
complicated state machine in it to make

1078
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,359
this work and

1079
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,359
what i can say is that it would be much

1080
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,720
easier to implement like a peer-to-peer

1081
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,040
version of it in a name server because

1082
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,680
the name server already ha the signer

1083
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,319
already had the state of all the keys

1084
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:33,280
um

1085
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,920
but i mean that is obviously in

1086
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,800
a future development that we could talk

1087
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,200
after we actually have verified that

1088
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,799
this is working in the first place

1089
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,960
okay i think

1090
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,839
okay that was the queue

1091
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,319
any other questions we still have time

1092
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,760
for one

1093
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,880
no

1094
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,880
okay thank you

1095
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,440
thank you ulrich and schumann

1096
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,280
um

1097
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,240
so yeah concluding i think

1098
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,640
you're well on your way

1099
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,280
in writing the document um

1100
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,920
and and for your own timeline what do

1101
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,680
you think so uh

1102
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,359
well they're both operational you're

1103
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,880
implementing stuff but also for the

1104
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,839
draft how much work do you

1105
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:23,759
expect well we expect that we would

1106
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,599
have the implementation

1107
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,440
ready

1108
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,599
in the next months and then we would run

1109
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,839
the experiments before the next itf so

1110
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,160
that we could you know they update the

1111
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,680
document with the

1112
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,359
remaining to-do's

1113
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:38,640
and um

1114
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,440
then

1115
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,040
depending on feedback from the working

1116
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,279
group

1117
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,960
we hope that we're good to go but you

1118
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,240
know what i mean

1119
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,560
there's always so

1120
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,599
it always details

1121
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,118
thank you

1122
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,839
okay thank you uluri

1123
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:00,800
thank you

1124
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,680
thank you

1125
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,200
we're doing well with time

1126
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,680
next presentation is

1127
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,319
by shivan

1128
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,000
and or

1129
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,960
chief on this in the room hi steven um

1130
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,560
do you want to present your slides

1131
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,400
yourself so i uploaded them already in

1132
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,000
meat echo so

1133
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,599
if you oh yeah yeah you ask

1134
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,920
there you go

1135
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,280
right perfect excellent sure should i

1136
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,319
start

1137
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,400
yeah yes please

1138
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,520
sounds good

1139
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,599
um hi all uh i'll be talking about

1140
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,560
domain verification techniques using dns

1141
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,319
which is a draft that

1142
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,040
schumann and i have been working on

1143
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,760
we also presented this at the last itf

1144
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,800
and

1145
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,880
we've gotten some good feedback

1146
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,040
before and after that i mean we wanted

1147
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,520
to ask for adoption

1148
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,920
so just very briefly um what is domain

1149
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,119
verification

1150
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,000
uh

1151
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,319
what is your verification so essentially

1152
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,240
as folks probably know

1153
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,319
many providers on the internet need

1154
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,440
users to

1155
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,280
prove that they

1156
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,280
have some kind of kind of control over a

1157
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,200
domain and

1158
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,440
service providers ask users to put a dns

1159
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,400
record

1160
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,880
in their zone that proves that they're

1161
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,720
the ones who control their domain

1162
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,440
and a good example it is let's encrypt

1163
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,920
with the

1164
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,280
dns-01 challenge

1165
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,319
and um you put the you put the challenge

1166
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,800
text record and then once it's verified

1167
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,160
by let's encrypt you get issued a cert

1168
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,599
and

1169
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,599
i won't go into

1170
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,800
the whole

1171
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,400
draft because we talked about it last

1172
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,400
time but just as a refresher the draft

1173
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,280
is fairly simple it gives an overview of

1174
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,200
existing techniques

1175
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,400
talks about text records and cname

1176
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,680
which are the

1177
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,400
two

1178
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,400
ways in which we saw that service

1179
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,640
providers right now are

1180
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,040
doing dns based domain verification and

1181
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,119
also we give recommendations

1182
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,720
um some of them are targeted domain

1183
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,960
verification so that there isn't bloat

1184
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,920
um

1185
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,960
at the

1186
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,640
at the label and also time bound

1187
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,960
checking because um we notice that some

1188
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,400
service providers

1189
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,720
ask people to just keep the

1190
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,480
verifying records around for a very long

1191
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,119
time which is again not great for bloat

1192
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,440
uh and also we recommend the use of um

1193
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,839
we suggest the use of dnsec to prevent

1194
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,440
spoofing and i put in a link to the 111

1195
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,640
presentation over here

1196
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,720
and we've gotten a bunch of feedback

1197
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,359
uh on the mailing list and the mic

1198
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,280
and there were some security issues that

1199
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,560
were talked about

1200
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,319
at the mic especially last time and

1201
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,560
we've been using github to capture all

1202
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,520
of that

1203
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,800
and i think

1204
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
yeah we know that detailed security

1205
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,520
analysis is needed but i think that

1206
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,359
would really like benefit from the

1207
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,760
involvement of the working group

1208
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,000
and um

1209
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,319
that's basically it so yeah i think

1210
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,319
shimon and i would both want to

1211
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,279
ask for adoption

1212
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,280
thank you thank you shifan um

1213
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,200
yeah

1214
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,680
um so first of all let's see if there

1215
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,079
are any hands erased

1216
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,599
no there's no one in queue

1217
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,200
going once going twice yeah paul please

1218
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,839
go ahead

1219
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,710
[Music]

1220
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,160
oh sorry paul

1221
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,799
we can't hear you

1222
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,839
test oh sorry okay um i just wanted to

1223
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,160
reiterate again uh as i did on the last

1224
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,680
meeting that this is super important

1225
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,440
this is a huge problem

1226
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,680
and and we should not stall this and

1227
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,520
really move this forward fast

1228
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,680
okay thank you

1229
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,480
is the more support in the room

1230
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,480
i've i've

1231
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,000
just went over the mailing list and

1232
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,079
there was quite some

1233
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,200
there was a good discussion on the

1234
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,079
mailing list after the last presentation

1235
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,400
schumann

1236
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,839
schuman please go ahead yeah

1237
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:25,520
sure uh so yeah so uh benno and chairs

1238
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,280
the other thing i would uh recommend

1239
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,400
that you do is

1240
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,160
look at the

1241
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,960
minutes and the uh recording of the last

1242
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,160
um

1243
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,599
presentation that we did there were a

1244
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,359
lot of there was quite a lot of vocal

1245
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:38,960
support for this draft right being

1246
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,119
adopted and the fact that a lot of these

1247
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,440
domain verification techniques are kind

1248
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,200
of they've grown up organically in ad

1249
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,960
hoc right and no one sat down and done

1250
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,040
any like serious security analysis of

1251
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,319
these schemes

1252
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:53,359
and that's kind of like a a big gap that

1253
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,200
the dns community

1254
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,319
can uh can can jump in and make sure

1255
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,200
that these things are being done in a

1256
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,839
in a secure and maintainable fashion

1257
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,400
thank you shulman um

1258
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,800
joey

1259
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,880
thank you um

1260
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,920
i wonder i'm just wondering other than

1261
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,559
working more on that security analysis

1262
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,400
uh what would be the next

1263
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,599
yes and

1264
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,920
um i i see

1265
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,760
it hasn't been updated since the

1266
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,240
previous yeah so i was just wondering

1267
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,040
like

1268
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,319
uh

1269
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,400
what are the reasons um

1270
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,070
how to phrase this um

1271
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:39,680
[Music]

1272
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,839
um like what has changed in order like

1273
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:42,640
to

1274
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,760
uh

1275
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,640
support adoption better this time if

1276
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,279
that makes sense

1277
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,440
yeah i think we've just been gathering

1278
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,400
feedback in the github issues i guess um

1279
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,079
and that's where all of them are right

1280
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,200
now in terms of work to do i think um

1281
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,960
there's like a few sections to be filled

1282
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,680
out

1283
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,119
uh especially like

1284
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,559
recommending like when to use text

1285
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,880
versus cname um but yeah i mean from the

1286
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,480
point of view of the authors i think we

1287
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,680
also thought that it was ready for

1288
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,040
adoption last time

1289
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,520
um so but we all you know we also

1290
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,359
figured that would be good to give a

1291
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,400
just a refresher um this itf and yeah

1292
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,880
again ask good option

1293
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,040
should we do a count of hands then i

1294
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,800
mean show of hands or

1295
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,119
something

1296
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,640
i'll leave that up to the chairs but

1297
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,000
yeah

1298
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,960
thank you thank you shiva so joey so

1299
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,559
indeed in in the indiana shop we

1300
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,800
we go to the mic indeed so it's it's

1301
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,400
it's support in the working group then

1302
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,319
we take it uh the call for adoption to

1303
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,839
the mailing list

1304
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:49,920
um uh and in the on the mailing list uh

1305
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,319
there's there's the formal call of dot

1306
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,079
call for adoption

1307
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,440
um but again uh as we are working on our

1308
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,480
backlog

1309
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,680
and are we going a good uh we did

1310
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,680
well we did a good job in the past month

1311
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:08,960
so we have to be cautious not to accept

1312
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,640
too many new drafts because then we're

1313
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,119
in the same situation that are too many

1314
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,000
active drafts and there's less focus

1315
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,920
this is also a result of the

1316
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,839
well previous discussions of the working

1317
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:20,640
group

1318
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,800
and not about not only the dinosaur

1319
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,720
chairs and the ad but also the working

1320
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,559
group participants

1321
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:27,680
that we

1322
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,480
need to focus our work

1323
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,680
um so it's not uh it's it's not a

1324
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,240
qualitative

1325
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,280
statement not to adopt or postpone it's

1326
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,559
really a managing workload and

1327
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:45,200
we we did hear you we did hear uh the

1328
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,800
different participants

1329
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,920
about the importance of this work and um

1330
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,480
maybe i should give the word to tim

1331
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,359
maybe

1332
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,680
and brett you are still in queue so uh

1333
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,960
but

1334
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,960
i was waiting for brett first

1335
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,720
so unless he's done yeah okay no so uh

1336
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,480
definitely um

1337
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,480
the the chairs will be in contact with

1338
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,920
uh steven and schumann

1339
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,000
also

1340
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,480
making an indication how much work

1341
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,240
there is to be done on the document but

1342
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,640
also for the working group and plan the

1343
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,079
work

1344
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:20,960
and

1345
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:21,839
yeah

1346
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:22,800
okay

1347
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,640
red please go ahead go ahead brett

so you

1352
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,720
maybe some

1353
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,240
another button

1354
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,720
i'll i'll speak quickly brett and then

1355
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,079
if you can figure that out in the short

1356
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,119
term how's that so

1357
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,440
okay cool um

1358
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,040
speaking as an operator i think this is

1359
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,200
like way important and i you know as

1360
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,319
i've sort of

1361
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:03,599
have sort of hammered on schumann

1362
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:05,280
siobhan they should just keep hammering

1363
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,960
on this because there's this is good

1364
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,440
stuff so um

1365
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,880
and we'll figure out the whole chair

1366
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,920
we'll figure out the whole adoption

1367
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,760
thing right so don't stop

1368
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,079
as i keep telling you you too i

1369
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:17,520
work so

1370
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,040
i always feel like i'm just

1371
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,400
cracking the whip on the stream on and i

1372
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,079
feel sorry about that so i apologize you

1373
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,240
won

1374
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,559
no definitely it's good work yeah but

1375
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,559
it's uh yeah

1376
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,240
we have also managed to work loud and

1377
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,559
but i think we're in good shape now as a

1378
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,520
working group and adopting new work

1379
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,800
um

1380
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,240
brett can you try it again

1381
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,520
no no sorry i don't hear you maybe you

1382
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,520
can type your question i will relate

1383
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,119
yeah thanks

1384
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,040
uh schumann

1385
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,760
um yeah so just answering tim uh i think

1386
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,680
that's fine we can keep plugging it uh

1387
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,599
plugging away at the draft shivan and i

1388
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:58,319
but

1389
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,839
we're hoping if

1390
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:03,200
it was adopted early we we would we

1391
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,119
could recruit more collaborators to help

1392
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:07,359
us with the you know security analysis

1393
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:08,079
and

1394
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,079
more extensive analysis of these schemes

1395
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,440
so that was

1396
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,599
in our opinion one of the benefits of

1397
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,599
earlier adoption but yeah i mean point

1398
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,119
tech and i realize you have to manage

1399
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,160
the queue of work so we can

1400
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,880
uh plug away edit by ourselves in the

1401
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,280
meantime and if anyone wants to

1402
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,920
collaborate with us just uh yes let's

1403
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,440
speak out yes let's you know

1404
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,200
collaborators please you know

1405
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,079
step up um yeah i already see

1406
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,760
paul volunteering in the chat and

1407
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,839
anybody else that wants to

1408
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,839
help get this draft ready for adoption

1409
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:41,760
okay thank you yep didn't know that

1410
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,079
schumann so you know we'll find you

1411
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,359
people how's that

1412
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:47,520
yep thanks all right and thanks we've

1413
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,200
recruited paul that's good that's good

1414
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,720
okay thank you

1415
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,359
um question

1416
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,040
uh from brad

1417
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,920
and relaying from the jobber room i was

1418
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,359
just going to

1419
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,680
a add my support

1420
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,640
and b

1421
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,119
question the title of the draft it says

1422
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,640
survey but you

1423
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,520
talk about recommendations

1424
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,200
the title may confuse people into

1425
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,118
thinking it's just informational

1426
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,960
yeah from our point of view it is

1427
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,400
informational because we're trying to

1428
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,640
capture as much um

1429
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,800
like as much like first of all the

1430
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,880
survey of like what people are doing in

1431
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,640
the field right now and then also the

1432
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,920
different like trade-offs that people

1433
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,839
might want to make so this would not be

1434
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,359
a normative document this would more

1435
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,520
capture the guidance and

1436
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,640
um what people think that we should do

1437
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,800
you know um like when you should use

1438
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,280
like a cname record versus a text record

1439
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,440
um for verification so so yeah so this

1440
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,720
would be more

1441
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,760
um

1442
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,680
this would be more like guidance than

1443
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,520
prescriptive

1444
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,200
okay

1445
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,559
thanks

1446
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,559
uh peter

1447
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,880
so i also asked my coach here suzanne

1448
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:06,079
how are we doing uh with respect to time

1449
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,480
okay so peter go please go ahead yeah

1450
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,040
yeah i don't know exactly who is um

1451
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,200
[Music]

1452
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,000
um

1453
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,520
what kind of parties are involved in the

1454
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,079
bms apps group i mean obviously name

1455
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:21,040
server

1456
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,440
implemented resolver operators and art

1457
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,720
operators and all these people

1458
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,680
and

1459
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,920
regarding this draft i wonder who the

1460
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,359
address he is

1461
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:32,640
because for example in the case of

1462
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,319
certificate issuance

1463
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,160
i guess

1464
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,680
that would be something that um

1465
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,000
cas would have to

1466
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,920
expect from the customers so for example

1467
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,760
that's encrypt would have to say

1468
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,559
um

1469
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,079
you should put this in that record into

1470
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,480
the dns so cis have to be convinced but

1471
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,240
i don't think cis are part of the dns

1472
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,200
apps group

1473
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,599
then for github verification or domain

1474
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,240
verification for office 365 or something

1475
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,520
then these companies have to be

1476
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,559
convinced

1477
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:01,760
and um

1478
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,200
i'm not sure if

1479
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,880
if they consider themselves involved

1480
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,119
with dns operations also

1481
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:08,880
um so

1482
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,160
while i think these recommendations are

1483
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,720
good i just wonder if um

1484
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,799
they will get heard when you put them in

1485
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,640
dns ops

1486
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,720
so who's the addressee of the

1487
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,720
draft

1488
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,880
yeah i think um

1489
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,559
it is definitely like service providers

1490
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,160
for sure um

1491
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,680
and

1492
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,680
i think the idea is that a lot of folks

1493
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,400
have

1494
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,520
um

1495
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,319
have come up with like ways of doing um

1496
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,720
domain verification that

1497
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,000
they kind of just

1498
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,520
um we talked about this in the draft a

1499
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,119
little bit like some of them extremely

1500
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,359
well formatted and some of them are just

1501
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:48,960
you know just here here put a string and

1502
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,640
they don't really talk about any

1503
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,480
requirements around that so and we think

1504
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,839
this happened because of the lack of

1505
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:56,559
guidance and um so yes i think the hope

1506
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:57,839
is that given

1507
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,680
like an ietf document um that'll help

1508
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,839
so people can like point towards that

1509
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,440
and kind of use that when designing

1510
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,680
domain verification techniques

1511
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,680
or domain notification methods for their

1512
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,399
own services

1513
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,280
again so just to follow up uh siobhan i

1514
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,240
think

1515
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,280
uh peter to your point yeah so i i i

1516
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,119
think our expectation is once we develop

1517
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,799
this draft a little bit more

1518
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:34,799
we will have to do outreach to

1519
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:36,160
application and service provider

1520
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,839
communities right to kind of clue them

1521
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:38,720
in

1522
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,920
uh to uh you know what uh if any

1523
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,599
recommendations come out of this draft

1524
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,359
to see if we can

1525
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,799
persuade them to adopt those

1526
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:48,400
recommendations so

1527
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,680
i think that's

1528
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,280
we expected that to be part of the

1529
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,280
process

1530
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:06,000
thank you thank you both um

1531
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,559
any final words

1532
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:09,359
no

1533
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,240
so uh thank you thank you shivan and

1534
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,760
schumann for uh pushing this work

1535
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,760
and uh

1536
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,040
definitely the chairs will have a

1537
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,319
follow-up with you

1538
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,720
there and well paul routers and also

1539

brett brett carr

1540
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,520
volunteered to help that's good

1541
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,640
and we will definitely make progress uh

1542
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,920
in the next month

1543
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,280
yeah

1544
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,280
perfect thanks better thanks sirs

1545
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,319
yeah thank you

1546
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,480
next we have

1547
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,640
let's look at the agenda

1548
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,839
structured data for dns error access

1549
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,160
denied error pages then yeah there you

1550
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,480
are and then how do you want do you want

1551
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,200
to run the slides i can

1552
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,880
do that for you

1553
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,799
we uploaded them already in

1554
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,799
mid echo

1555
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:02,720
oh sorry i see the request yeah

1556
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,040
there you go

1557
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:26,319
i can't hear you yet

1558
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:30,180
[Music]

1559
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,160
that better yeah

1560
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,200
thank you um

1561
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,280
so my name is dan wang i'm talking about

1562
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,280
uh structured dns error page

1563
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,960
um so our purpose for this document is

1564
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,559
to provide some parsable data we decided

1565
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:53,760
on json for the user and it to

1566
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,040
troubleshoot

1567
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,359
why a dns

1568
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:01,040
query was filtered by something upstream

1569
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,480
and then this information can be

1570
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,640
displayed in logs and nothing you know

1571
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,240
done with it

1572
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,760
interactively you know at the time it

1573
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,000
occurs or it can be displayed on the

1574
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,720
user interface of the operating system

1575
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,799
the browser or whatever

1576
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:17,200
and the adjustments we made here better

1577
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,839
handle headless devices that don't

1578
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,240
have a web browser and don't need to use

1579
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,880
a web browser to go get the information

1580
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,720
that was one of the deficiencies of the

1581
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,760
draft that we're superseding with this

1582
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,119
that's mentioned at the bottom draft

1583
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:33,520
ready dns hop error page

1584
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,839
we've received a bunch of comments i saw

1585
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,359
a bunch came in

1586
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:40,000
late yesterday my time from peter

1587
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,319
which was was pretty cool

1588
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:44,480
and i'll talk about a couple of those

1589
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,359
things

1590
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,200
as we go through

1591
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,599
so the design handles

1592
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:52,400
a commercial filter and an it or

1593
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,440
parental operated or you know whoever is

1594
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,160
operating another layer of filtering to

1595
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,000
filter whatever that they additionally

1596
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,480
want to do so the commercial dns filter

1597
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,400
might filter malware might be a

1598
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,400
government mandated filter

1599
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,839
to filter

1600
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:10,000
child porn sites

1601
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,480
and then the it operated or parental

1602
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,280
operated dns filter might do some other

1603
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,760
stuff all eventually going to the client

1604
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,599
so the protocol allows

1605
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:20,720
these

1606
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,400
these filters and these blocks to be

1607
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,839
propagated down should the one the the

1608
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,520
filter in the middle decide that it

1609
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,079
wants to propagate that down

1610
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,240
in a lot of situations with parental

1611
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,720
filtering and with it filtering

1612
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,920
the

1613
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,799
the intermediary needs to be involved to

1614
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:40,319
resolve

1615
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,480
problems with filtering done by the

1616
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,559
upstream uh because they own the

1617
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,319
contract they have the

1618
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,559
uh the phone number to call

1619
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:51,839
uh to resolve those issues um so but

1620
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,240
that it turns into something the

1621
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,640
protocol handles either way

1622
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,599
but

1623
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,760
there's operational concerns and issues

1624
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,880
there

1625
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,680
the packet format is the usual

1626
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,319
um and then this slide i'll update for

1627
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:08,160
the meeting materials i noticed this

1628
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,599
morning that there's

1629
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,839
a couple things missing in it

1630
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,000
but the json that comes down is is

1631
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,480
purposefully as tight as i could figure

1632
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,760
out how to make it um so the the c colon

1633
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,559
is

1634
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:22,480
uh intended to

1635
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,599
have anything that the filter service

1636
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,960
wants to include to help it identify

1637
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,960
this filtered event so this could be a

1638
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,040
time stamp like shown here

1639
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,440
it could be any unique value a sequence

1640
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,920
number that it wants to keep track of

1641
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,400
for each time it does a filter

1642
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,640
could be anything that it likes

1643
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,319
doesn't matter the protocol itself

1644
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,400
doesn't care this is something that is

1645
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,559
generated and a responsibility of the

1646
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:51,119
the dns filter

1647
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:51,520
uh itself

1648
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:55,599
the d colon uh is the domain of the doh

1649
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:58,000
dot server that the user is connected to

1650
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,920
this is to detect if the uh

1651
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,599
doh dot server is just blindly proxying

1652
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,680
and forwarding this traffic or is

1653
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,599
actually aware of this extension there's

1654
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,960
some stuff talked about in the draft on

1655
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,640
why that's valuable

1656
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:18,160
the j colon is some free form text

1657
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,920
we have a discussion point later to talk

1658
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,680
about what language that's in

1659
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,200
which is a thing that causes me a little

1660
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,000
bit of grief only the d and the j are

1661
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,160
mandatory as specified currently in the

1662
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,359
draft peter had some comments on that

1663
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,599
o is a free form organization that is

1664
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:35,760
doing the filtering and r

1665
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,720
points off to

1666
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,160
a

1667
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,839
justification for why this filtering

1668
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,839
happens so might be an employee contract

1669
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:45,440
for why

1670
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,000
a job site or a guns and ammo site or

1671
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,839
whatever was being filtered

1672
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:52,319
or point to a country specification a

1673
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:54,480
country requirement that child porn be

1674
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,160
filtered if that was the reason that it

1675
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,000
was filtered

1676
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,160
so then on the client

1677
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,200
it

1678
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,799
constructs the url by prefixing https

1679
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:07,200
to the d colon value

1680
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,359
and appending the

1681
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:11,680
query parameters for c

1682
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,440
what i missed here on this slide and i

1683
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,119
will update in the meeting material is

1684
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:18,160
it also appends the don't the the domain

1685
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,440
queried from the dns query and the uh

1686
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,720
the

1687
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,319
record type that was queried like a or

1688
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:27,119
quad a or whatever

1689
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,839
um there's some security considerations

1690
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:33,119
um the um

1691
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,319
one is we want no clickable links uh in

1692
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:39,200
the o and the j fields uh because they

1693
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,680
then need to be uh sanitized on where

1694
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,440
they're going and what you know what

1695
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,280
they're for

1696
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,520
so that's something that needs to be

1697
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:51,599
probably cleaned up in the client um how

1698
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,920
to do that we don't specify quite yet we

1699
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,599
need to socialize that a little bit more

1700
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,400
see how we want to handle that

1701
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,640
encrypted and authenticated dns on that

1702
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,559
first bullet is mandatory because we

1703
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,960
don't want arbitrary

1704
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,359
justification text to be inserted into a

1705
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,680
dns query response pair

1706
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,880
would be bad

1707
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,960
and then if the url

1708
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,400
is being visited for the c and the r uh

1709
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,720
pages that are formed

1710
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,359
uh is uh that that url should be in a

1711
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:23,200
constrained environment similar to what

1712
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,319
captive portals are doing today but keep

1713
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:28,240
in mind that processing those

1714
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,720
two things the c and the r fields is

1715
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,079
optional

1716
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:34,559
because again we're expecting and hoping

1717
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,799
that the j field the justification free

1718
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:38,720
form contains enough information to

1719
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,599
understand why this was filtered that's

1720
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:44,640
why we're not using uh predefined you

1721
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,359
know

1722
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:46,960
error code number one error code number

1723
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,640
two error code number three

1724
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,200
which etsy is taking a path of defining

1725
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,000
for filtering but rather freeform text

1726
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,559
so that anything that the operator

1727
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,920
wants to put in here for why they

1728
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,599
filtered can actually be put in here

1729
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:04,240
uh and this is my last slide so a couple

1730
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,079
of discussion points that that i'd like

1731
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:08,480
to get feedback on on the list or right

1732
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,520
now

1733
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,400
are how to handle the language in the j

1734
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,559
and perhaps also the organization field

1735
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:17,119
but really the justification field is

1736
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:19,599
the one that is most concerning

1737
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:20,400
that

1738
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,000
you know if it comes back in german you

1739
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,799
don't speak german it is

1740
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,880
not helpful

1741
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,839
some consideration is if that comes back

1742
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:31,680
a web browser

1743
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,559
could itself with its built-in translate

1744
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,240
capability just translate it for the

1745
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,200
user

1746
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,359
um not terribly appealing

1747
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,960
but some discussion on that would be

1748
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,599
kind of nice and then also the isolated

1749
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,280
browser environment

1750
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,240
and how folks feel about that there is a

1751
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,280
increase

1752
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,440
in security posture for the client for

1753
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,200
that situation

1754
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,520
but it also means the user doesn't get

1755
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,000
autofill for and and also doesn't get

1756
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,640
cookies to open a ticket with their

1757
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,720
service provider you know they're or

1758
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,799
whoever is doing that filtering

1759
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:08,400
because it's in this constrained

1760
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,680
environment that's not going to autofill

1761
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,799
and they have to type everything

1762
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:13,680
manually which is a real pain

1763
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,359
and i don't know if this is interesting

1764
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:17,359
enough for the working group to consider

1765
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:19,280
adopting it quite yet or if we'd like to

1766
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,760
go another cycle but

1767
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,119
most interested in those first two

1768
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:25,520
discussion points so

1769
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,480
that's my presentation

1770
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,039
thank you dan

1771
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,440
uh yeah there's a queue

1772
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,720
then you want to run the queue yourself

1773
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:40,000
no i i don't

1774
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,119
but thanks

1775
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:47,799
excellent ben please go ahead

1776
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:51,760
hi so uh

1777
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,520
we've been talking about this topic for

1778
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,640
a long time

1779
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,559
and so i've been saying

1780
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,880
my my thought about this for a long time

1781
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,280
which is i am very very cautious about

1782
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,119
about anything here

1783
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:06,000
that

1784
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,039
gives

1785
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:10,160
the gives the dns operator the ability

1786
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,039
to

1787
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:13,520
jump into a connection that wasn't for

1788
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:17,680
them and present the user with

1789
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,920
with any information especially

1790
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,000
information that the user can't verify

1791
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,240
especially information that would

1792
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,720
potentially take the user to for example

1793
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,839
a different web property

1794
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:31,920
so

1795
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,960
in my view there's no safe use case here

1796
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,640
that involves presenting this to the

1797
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,000
user

1798
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,240
at least not in a web context

1799
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,720
and that's okay i think there's actually

1800
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,799
value nonetheless in this in this draft

1801
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:47,680
uh

1802
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,200
but what i would really like is a a

1803
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,760
shift to emphasis on

1804
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,559
on

1805
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:57,280
technical use cases and debugging where

1806
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,200
the risk of user harm is minimal

1807
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,400
and

1808
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,440
uh

1809
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,079
and i think a generalization here in my

1810
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:08,960
view access denied is not

1811
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,720
is not the only interesting use case

1812
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,880
here and this exact

1813
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,359
format or technology could apply equally

1814
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:17,679
well to diagnosing

1815
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,679
other dns failures in general i think

1816
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,080
this could be a useful essentially a

1817
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,679
useful addendum

1818
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:27,279
to the extended error codes draft to

1819
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:28,640
provide

1820
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,960
debugging at the client with

1821
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,279
more general structured information but

1822
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:34,479
i don't think there should be any

1823
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:36,479
expectation that this information is

1824
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,719
surfaced to an ordinary user where it

1825
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:40,640
could be used as part of an attack where

1826
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,479
it could be used to

1827
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:44,880
lie to the user about the rate reason

1828
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,198
for certain kinds of filtering or

1829
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:48,319
attempt to

1830
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:50,238
scare the user present the user with

1831
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:52,158
scary information about something to try

1832
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:55,520
to interfere with their perception of

1833
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,759
what they're accessing

1834
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,120
okay

1835
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,759
cool thank you

1836
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:03,359
okay

1837
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,960
next jonathan

1838
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,560
jennifer reed

1839
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,238
um i i so i i take ben's points like i

1840
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:11,279
said we've been talking about this for a

1841
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,120
while i have my views on it i think

1842
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,279
there is a real use case here for

1843
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:16,960
debugging i think there's a use case

1844
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,040
here for enterprises particularly

1845
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,759
enterprise products uh malware filtering

1846
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:24,719
uh all of this stuff and i think in

1847
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,799
you know a world in which i simply get

1848
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:28,880
an nx domain i don't know whose problem

1849
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,560
that is if i get an x domain along with

1850
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,198
some indicator that that next domain was

1851
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:34,399
intentional

1852
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:37,279
you know or or that or was fabricated or

1853
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:39,920
whatever um i think there's something in

1854
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,120
between

1855
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,759
dnsr codes and here we're gonna go

1856
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:45,759
automatically load this url for you and

1857
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:47,679
i think this draft can talk about what

1858
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,799
that is uh and i think that's you know

1859
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,080
the direction to go in i think it can

1860
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,679
provide guidance to

1861
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:56,000
uh iot device creators and and browsers

1862
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,920
and things like that um

1863
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,480
i take the point about attacks i have a

1864
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,480
hard time envisioning an attack

1865
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,040
uh that says i see what you're asking

1866
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,360
for and something is telling you you're

1867
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,280
not allowed to have it

1868
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,320
it doesn't give you phone number it

1869
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,080
doesn't give a url doesn't give anything

1870
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,719
just a it's not just you right that is

1871
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:16,239
the signal that this could lose and

1872
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:18,320
there's value in that in my opinion

1873
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,559
okay

1874
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,239
thank you um

1875
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:30,040
andrew andrew kepling

1876
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,840
uh hi um

1877
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,000
two points ready uh one just to echo

1878
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,640
something that uh peter said um in the

1879
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,239
chat uh which

1880
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:41,520
uh i'll read it out loud because it

1881
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,600
summed up what i was thinking but more

1882
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,280
succinctly than

1883
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,360
i would have phrased it which is uh

1884
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,880
uh bad senses uh sort of do just fine

1885
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,360
without support for this draft already

1886
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,760
um whereas the the draw supports good

1887
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,920
senses who want to be transparent about

1888
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,880
what they block um and why they block it

1889
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,880
uh to their users and i think that

1890
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,040
that's really the key here

1891
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:05,920
um

1892
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,000
to actually yeah

1893
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,840
for the well-behaved i mean census is a

1894
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,760
pejorative term but whatever um and so

1895
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,000
notwithstanding that uh there are valid

1896
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,719
reasons to block access to content this

1897
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:21,360
actually gives visibility to that um and

1898
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,880
then second point the current user

1899
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,760
experience is crap yeah let's be honest

1900
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,040
nx domain or some or a blank screen is

1901
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,400
pretty hopeless

1902
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,000
um you know

1903
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,640
i often remind people about rfc8890 you

1904
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,400
know the internet is meant to be friend

1905
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,440
users

1906
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,400
this

1907
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,400
this this document it gives us an

1908
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,239
opportunity to actually make it a much

1909
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:45,199
better um end user experience in

1910
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:49,360
enterprises um now with malware etc and

1911
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,840
i really think uh the the problems have

1912
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,840
been exaggerated and there's a really

1913
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,760
positive reason for going with this

1914
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,080
thank you

1915
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,440
thank you

1916
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,640
thank you

1917
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:07,640
um next eric eric oath

1918
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,920
hello am i audible

1919
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,280
just yes

1920
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,000
okay great so i think my opinion of this

1921
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,199
is it's

1922
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:17,600
as far as ever showing such information

1923
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,440
ui i think ben gave a pretty good

1924
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,280
description of why it's i think scary

1925
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,920
for pretty much any client to be able to

1926
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,760
show such information from the ui if

1927
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:29,120
some user types in hps example.com and

1928
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,960
we stick something in the the content

1929
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,679
pane that's not from example.com or from

1930
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:35,440
the browser itself which is controlled

1931
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,120
that's just a very scary security

1932
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,199
situation i can't do anything

1933
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:41,040
anywhere touching that without

1934
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,560
talking a huge number of security

1935
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,159
consultants on our side and figuring out

1936
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:45,440
if there's any safe way we can do that

1937
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:46,480
and

1938
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,000
at least in the old in the old version

1939
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,080
that's our pure ui it never rose to the

1940
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,159
priority level where i could even drive

1941
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,000
that and get enough opinions to even

1942
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,920
approach it but as far as a pure

1943
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,000
debugging scenario yeah sure it sounds

1944
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,360
very similar to

1945
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,880
ede which is something we could just

1946
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,159
stick in our

1947
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:04,640
debug logs and have available there for

1948
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,800
either us to debug stuff or for users to

1949
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,800
debug stuff

1950
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,719
the question then is if this is just

1951
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,719
filling a similar role to ede of just

1952
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,880
making the information known that this

1953
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,239
is

1954
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:18,560
oh this was blocked for this common

1955
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,080
reason

1956
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,520
are we getting enough value out of this

1957
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,040
compared to edu it would be worth

1958
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,880
pursuing to be worth

1959
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,719
resolvers sending this information if

1960
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:28,880
it's not then

1961
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,280
i don't know if this is enough to do so

1962
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,040
in the very least i think we need more

1963
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,560
information on just how this

1964
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,520
ideally goes alongside ede before anyone

1965
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,360
can really consider

1966
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,600
adopting much less consider implementing

1967
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,080
anything a lot of these lines

1968
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,600
okay

1969
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,840
thanks

1970
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,640
uh thank you

1971
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,440
um paul

1972
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,440
so

1973
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:01,199
um i'm busily typing minutes and i found

1974
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:03,520
myself flinching

1975
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,920
um at two people

1976
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,920
who spoke before me which is why i'm

1977
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,280
speaking

1978
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,080
the idea that you could use

1979
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:16,000
this protocol or any freaking protocol

1980
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,040
just in the enterprise space but not

1981
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,520
over the whole internet is

1982
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,600
i mean it's even scarier to me than i

1983
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:24,640
think

1984
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:25,679
this is

1985
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:27,920
scary for uh

1986
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,280
folks like ben

1987
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,560
um

1988
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:34,000
i fully agree with the the idea that you

1989
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,960
don't want to show users

1990
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,640
information

1991
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,280
that they could mistake as coming from a

1992
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,520
website if they ask to go to website and

1993
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,880
they're getting information from an

1994
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,280
intermediary intermediary

1995
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,880
dns server

1996
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,880
you've got to make it super super clear

1997
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,679
that this did not come from them but i

1998
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:55,679
am even more frightened by the idea that

1999
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:58,159
people think oh we'll just use this in

2000
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:00,159
enterprise and dan i know you've been on

2001
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:03,440
both sides of it's the whole internet or

2002
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,199
it's just enterprise and i think you

2003
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:06,880
know with stuff you're doing at citrix

2004
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,880
now you're more on the just enterprise

2005
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:13,600
side do you feel that this could be

2006
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,120
safely scoped to just enterprise

2007
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,120
no i don't see a reason to scope it to

2008
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,760
just enterprise myself

2009
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,400
because i think it's easy to show that

2010
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,440
this

2011
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,440
text that you're seeing did not come

2012
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,280
from the site you're visiting

2013
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,040
we're doing that today the industry's

2014
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,320
doing that today

2015
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,320
with nx domain

2016
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,640
um it shows i couldn't get there i

2017
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,400
couldn't find the server right and it

2018
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,320
shows a message

2019
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,000
and and i i i live with a use case where

2020
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,719
that doesn't work where

2021
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:49,760
the person will say the website says

2022
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,440
this when it's very clearly what you

2023
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,400
just said which was it was in fact

2024
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,440
safari saying this so

2025
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,920
yeah i i have some fears as well

2026
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,080
particularly if you're not feeling that

2027
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,320
it should be limited to the enterprise

2028
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,560
so just wanted to throw that in there

2029
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,400
with bring your own device and and

2030
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:12,000
taking my work computer to starbucks um

2031
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,840
you know which which is an enterprise

2032
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,480
scenario and which isn't um

2033
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,480
you know and starbucks may want to do

2034
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:21,199
filtering locally themselves you know

2035
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:22,400
for

2036
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,000
for their you know whatever their

2037
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,360
reasons are you know to use their

2038
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,040
network for free

2039
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,440
um you know buy a coffee and don't view

2040
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,360
porn because it upsets everyone else in

2041
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:32,840
the coffee shop

2042
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:36,159
reasonable uh it's their network um

2043
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:37,760
don't know

2044
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,760
but yeah i don't see a way to restrict

2045
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,760
anything to just enterprise i mean you

2046
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,840
know in theory imap was that way back in

2047
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,320
the day but it certainly isn't now

2048
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:47,760
right

2049
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,719
okay very good thanks

2050
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,400
thanks um

2051
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,199
yeah finally uh brian

2052
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:03,839
please go ahead

2053
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,080
i've been following it too closely but

2054
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,080
i'm thinking from the perspective of

2055
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,080
having looked at and even done stuff

2056
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,480
with rpc in the past

2057
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:16,880
uh one of the things about rpz changing

2058
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,880
response codes

2059
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,440
is that it's incompatible with

2060
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,440
dnsec for example

2061
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,320
but

2062
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,560
if you for example

2063
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,360
had an rpc response that is signed by

2064
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,159
the rpc operator or whatever the source

2065
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:33,120
is

2066
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,000
that

2067
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,440
creates

2068
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,679
a kind of a

2069
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:41,360
providence on providence on the response

2070
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:44,480
that's something that might be a way of

2071
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,640
proving who actually did that and you

2072
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,600
can then as either the enterprise or the

2073
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,600
end user decide whether you want to

2074
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,840
trust that or not and it can be

2075
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,080
a comparison against

2076
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,880
do i do i treat this as a server fail

2077
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,960
because i don't trust that source

2078
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,360
or do i do trust that source and i'm

2079
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,800
just going to happily

2080
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:08,159
acknowledge the the blockage anyway

2081
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:10,400
yeah

2082
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,760
yeah we had uh the authors um we had a

2083
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,679
discussion on that for probably 45

2084
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:18,480
minutes um and decided to not go down

2085
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,719
that path um

2086
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:22,480
partially because you know if the

2087
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,120
requirement to start to block it starts

2088
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,159
off with you have to do dns sec

2089
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:30,770
it's gets scary fast

2090
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:34,000
[Laughter]

2091
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,920
but yes that would be a much more

2092
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,880
authoritative way of identifying who

2093
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,960
who modified that record and you know or

2094
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,880
who who created that record very much

2095
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,640
like how

2096
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:45,920
tls

2097
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:50,080
fake certificates are done for tls proxy

2098
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:56,480
okay thank you dan um

2099
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,880
i think you get you've got enough

2100
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,239
feedback from the room that was great

2101
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:01,600
feedback i appreciate it thanks for

2102
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,679
everyone's time and uh reading the draft

2103
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,760
and all that that was great thanks

2104
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,960
okay thank you

2105
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,760
then the final presentation is

2106
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,679
by brian dixon

2107
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:16,400
we reserved about 30 minutes for the

2108
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,400
presentation

2109
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,760
they're both

2110
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,159
it's presentation of four documents and

2111
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:24,560
the same well not the same presentation

2112
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,960
but a similar presentation has been

2113
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,480
given by brian

2114
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:32,239
at deprive earlier just earlier today

2115
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:33,920
and we decided to

2116
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,840
also allocate 30 minutes for brian in

2117
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,040
dynasop

2118
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,840
because it both discusses dina's op

2119
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:45,199
drafts and deprived drafts and

2120
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:47,199
to give context

2121
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,000
brian asked to present all the documents

2122
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,400
at once for the different venues for

2123
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,000
both dpriv and dinosaur

2124
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,080
good

2125
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,159
brian are you ready

2126
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:02,880
how do you want to run do you want to

2127
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,560
run the slides yourself

2128
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,920
from me

2129
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,760
or i can do it

2130
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,120
that'd be great

2131
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,040
yeah okay okay

2132
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,239
and uh

2133
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:13,760
i know it's probably a little bit

2134
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,800
unusual but uh could i invite uh paul

2135
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,280
hoffman to the mic first to

2136
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,440
give me some immediate feedback on the

2137
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:25,360
clarity of of what the uh the goals are

2138
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,400
or what the

2139
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,800
use cases are um

2140
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,880
i'm not sure that i've i've done a good

2141
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,679
job of that and uh if he if he can

2142
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:35,120
give a little bit of feedback as i go

2143
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:38,320
through this that'd be great thanks

2144
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,239
uh so

2145
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:42,880
what this is talking about is a

2146
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,040
mostly a um

2147
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,000
derivative from uh an initial draft on

2148
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,320
authenticated dns over tls to

2149
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,960
authoritative that i put together and

2150
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,520
there are pieces of it that um i pulled

2151
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,120
out that belonged maybe more

2152
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,760
appropriately in dns off or as little

2153
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,520
standalone elements in deprive

2154
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:07,040
the goal is to provide a complete

2155
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,800
package of

2156
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,639
implementation

2157
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:12,840
guidance or

2158
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,480
specifications uh to allow um a resolver

2159
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,560
to talk to an authoritative

2160
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:22,239
get um have the ability to establish a

2161
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:24,719
authenticated connection to the

2162
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,480
authoritative server

2163
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,800
with respect to a specific domain name

2164
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,880
that it wants to send queries about

2165
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,320
um and

2166
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,199
the

2167
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:35,199
all the stuff is about how to do the

2168
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:37,440
discovery and signaling do it securely

2169
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,040
do it in a way that's downgrade

2170
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,960
resistant uh so

2171
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,840
next slide

2172
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:49,040
so it's privacy protection is the the

2173
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,120
main thing but that's pretty common

2174
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,920
across all of the a lot of competing

2175
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,280
um suggestions or drafts or proposals in

2176
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,560
deprive

2177
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:59,520
um

2178
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,320
i was taking this as a as a complete set

2179
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,560
of things and some of these are

2180
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,560
involving different solutions to some of

2181
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,560
the same underlying problems

2182
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,360
um one common thing for any of these is

2183
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,280
the authoritative server's identity must

2184
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,920
be authenticated uh if you want to do

2185
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,080
authenticated a dot

2186
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,199
um

2187
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:20,880
for that to be

2188
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,440
viable i'm i've come to the conclusion

2189
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,760
you need to have a secure delegation

2190
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,159
to the name server's name

2191
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:30,800
um the zone containing that uh it has to

2192
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,120
be deployable uh in a reasonably short

2193
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:36,000
time so i'm assuming the use of stuff

2194
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,480
that's only in dns with as few new

2195
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,480
protocol elements as possible

2196
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:43,520
and without requiring any major changes

2197
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,159
or even anything above the most minor

2198
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:49,199
on the registry registrar

2199
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:51,840
mechanisms for for transmitting stuff

2200
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:52,960
upstream

2201
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,120
within the dns system

2202
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,360
uh explicit signaling of support and

2203
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,440
being downgrade resistant

2204
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,919
next slide

2205
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:04,880
so

2206
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,360
the main adot ends up calling out a

2207
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:11,120
couple of new small drafts one is a

2208
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,960
thing i'm calling nsv

2209
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:16,960
that was the dns or ds hacks draft

2210
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:20,400
uh this is a new dns key algorithm

2211
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,760
that is used to protect delegation

2212
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,520
uh ns records

2213
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,560
via

2214
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,280
dns sec signature over a ds record which

2215
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:33,600
contains a hash of the name server name

2216
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,040
it's the only

2217
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,679
you need to have some way of of uh

2218
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:38,960
validating

2219
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,360
the target of an ns

2220
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,760
record in the parent the delegation

2221
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,440
in order to be able to trust the name

2222
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:48,000
that's being used in that

2223
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,360
since all the rest of it including the

2224
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,000
the actual name used in the certificate

2225
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,520
for tls

2226
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,159
as well as any signaling

2227
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:00,560
those are all dependent on that name

2228
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,159
so that's one of the drafts is just

2229
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:03,440
about um

2230
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,400
how to accomplish that in using a dns

2231
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,679
key algorithm

2232
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:10,320
the second draft is a thing called the

2233
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:13,760
dnst it's a new rr type and it's simply

2234
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:17,440
explicit support for transport

2235
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,520
tied to the domain name of the name

2236
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:20,560
server

2237
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,679
um and the name server domain has to be

2238
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:26,560
dnsx signed so this becomes

2239
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,679
a

2240
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:29,199
protected

2241
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:30,480
signaling things so it's downgrade

2242
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,679
resistant

2243
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,400
and glue glue guidance is

2244
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,719
kind of optional but it

2245
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:39,520
it's useful potentially to compare

2246
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,400
the glueless guidance against what ds

2247
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,800
glue has it but i don't think that's

2248
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,600
necessary to discuss in this

2249
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,600
this form right now

2250
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,159
next slide

2251
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:54,719
and

2252
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:56,560
i'm using a

2253
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:00,320
tls for adot sorry tls a for adot i

2254
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,719
should have said tlsa not tls

2255
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:04,080
um

2256
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,840
and i've i've

2257
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,840
started with the assumption that i'm

2258
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,679
going to need a new rr type which is an

2259
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,760
alias for tlsa that might not be the

2260
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,840
case

2261
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,639
the

2262
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,199
validation of the tls certificate that

2263
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:21,440
eventually gets presented to the

2264
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,560
resolver

2265
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,400
is an important part of this

2266
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,120
and i can see there's only really two

2267
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,960
good ways of doing that validation on a

2268
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,719
certificate web pki or tlsa

2269
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:34,719
and since tlsa is part of the dns

2270
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:36,560
standard and we're already i've already

2271
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,920
said

2272
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:41,120
for the transport flag

2273
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,800
validation

2274
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,199
that zone has to be signed anyway

2275
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:48,000
so there's not a lot of additional uh

2276
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,320
incremental overhead in saying let's use

2277
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:53,040
a tlsa record

2278
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,679
if you can validate the tlsa record

2279
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:57,920
um you're good to go you don't actually

2280
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,000
technically need web ppi doesn't mean

2281
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,239
you can't use web web pki issued certs

2282
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:05,600
it just says that you don't actually

2283
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,480
have to use the web pki validation you

2284
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,000
can still do that you can still choose

2285
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,360
to do that you don't have to

2286
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,239
and then there's a question of new rr

2287
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:19,360
type or just use an unprefixed tls say

2288
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:23,080
the name server name

2289
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,639
next slide

2290
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:28,080
and feel free to tell me if i'm going

2291
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:32,000
too fast anyone just raise your hand

2292
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:38,880
so the the novel thing here uh nsv

2293
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:42,719
it's just uh the sv is just the the uh

2294
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:44,159
mnemonic for

2295
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:46,800
a new dns key algorithm

2296
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,840
uh which is being used to validate ns

2297
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,760
records

2298
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,840
the

2299
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,120
it's used to create a special ds record

2300
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,159
it's possible to use a ds record even if

2301
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:03,440
this child zone is not signed

2302
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,719
if you look at the last line in this

2303
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,520
slide it says unknown dns key algorithms

2304
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,199
are treated as insecure rather than

2305
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:10,239
bonus

2306
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:12,639
so nsv unaware resolvers don't have

2307
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:15,360
problems with this proposed edition

2308
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:16,840
so the idea

2309
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:20,159
is you take the name server name

2310
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:21,600
you

2311
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,560
uh

2312
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:25,280
put it into a

2313
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,360
structure which is technically a dns key

2314
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,520
structure you don't actually publish the

2315
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,000
dns key in the child zone and that

2316
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,719
avoids making the child's own

2317
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:35,760
seem

2318
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,159
as if it's actually dns excited because

2319
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:39,920
it doesn't have to be

2320
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:43,199
you then take the hash of that

2321
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,520
new record type

2322
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:46,560
and

2323
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,960
that becomes your ds record

2324
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:52,719
validating that is using the parent nsr

2325
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:53,600
data

2326
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,840
so where you've got an ns record

2327
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,600
the target name which is the right hand

2328
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,679
side of the ns record is the name server

2329
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:00,639
name

2330
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:02,560
you follow the same construction method

2331
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,719
take the name server name you hash it as

2332
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:07,520
as a as if it was a dns key and compare

2333
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,639
that against the ds if it matches

2334
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:14,480
um you're good and you can be reasonably

2335
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:17,520
assured that the ns record in the parent

2336
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:18,960
for the delegation

2337
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,600
has not been tampered with

2338
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,080
that's all this is it's protecting the

2339
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:26,159
nameserver record from

2340
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:29,840
an on path attacker by using ds record

2341
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,440
and the fact that the ds record is going

2342
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:32,560
to be signed

2343
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:35,360
in the parent zone

2344
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,199
uh

2345
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:39,759
next slide

2346
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:46,400
uh dnst for signaling uh ad adot support

2347
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,880
this is just a new record type that

2348
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,800
would be in the child zone at the name

2349
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,320
server's name

2350
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:56,000
uh the record would simply consist of

2351
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,280
three flags

2352
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,440
that are either set or not set and

2353
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,679
indicating support for each of the three

2354
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:04,159
different transport protocols that

2355
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:07,040
i put in the draft udp which is

2356
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:10,880
obviously vanilla dns tcp vanilla dns

2357
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,440
and dot which is dns over tls to

2358
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,040
authority

2359
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,480
um

2360
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,400
it's using the same owner name

2361
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,800
but what i'll point out is that

2362
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,600
nameservers can have more than one name

2363
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:27,520
so if you want to differentiate

2364
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:29,520
a nameserver

2365
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:33,280
usage case of having some

2366
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,679
of the zones that it serves being

2367
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:38,320
dot supported and some other ones not

2368
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,000
you give them different names and put in

2369
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,480
different dnst records and they all

2370
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,560
resolve to the same address

2371
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,239
and then it's a question of

2372
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:49,199
based on the delegation what the zone

2373
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:50,320
name is

2374
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:53,760
do you try to or do you want to use uh

2375
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:55,360
dlt or not

2376
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,440
uh or rather has that that's been

2377
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:58,960
explicitly signaled

2378
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,440
by the nameserver operator

2379
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,760
it's not required to do this i'm saying

2380
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,560
it's available as a mechanism

2381
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,679
so an authority server operator can do

2382
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:12,800
dlt to everybody dod to nobody or

2383
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,800
potentially do it on a zone by zone

2384
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:15,920
basis

2385
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:16,800
um

2386
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,320
without actually

2387
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,560
having anything other than the

2388
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:24,960
name server name being a differentiator

2389
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,360
um and then

2390
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:28,480
for

2391
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,960
dot to be usable the client has to

2392
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:33,520
validate that the zone assigned the

2393
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:36,719
record is present and the dot flag is

2394
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:38,320
set

2395
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:38,760
um

2396
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:40,560
[Music]

2397
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,280
that covers that oh and i i point out

2398
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:46,080
that you can you can do some odd things

2399
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,840
that are not really going to be useful

2400
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,440
outside of the enterprise but within an

2401
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,920
enterprise you can actually set up zones

2402
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,639
that require dot and don't support

2403
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:55,679
vanilla

2404
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:57,520
uh queries and answers

2405
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:58,800
so that

2406
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,480
for instance the dns root um authority

2407
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,960
server could actually be doing um client

2408
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,120
cert validation to allow

2409
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,880
it to restrict who's allowed to actually

2410
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,080
do queries

2411
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:12,080
it's kind of an odd edge case but it's

2412
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,480
interesting

2413
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,840
next slide

2414
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,719
uh all of this is about downgrade

2415
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:21,840
resistance

2416
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,520
um that's why

2417
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,120
the nsv algorithm ds hashes are ds

2418
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,920
hashes in the parent zone they're signed

2419
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:33,280
um restrict the usage of ns

2420
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,920
uh to cases where

2421
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,600
if there's a if there's a corresponding

2422
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,560
ds

2423
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:42,800
that the ds and the ns are in agreement

2424
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:43,679
um

2425
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:45,760
and the children

2426
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,760
uh child um

2427
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,960
records in the name server names zone

2428
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:54,480
um those are also this dns sign zone so

2429
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,880
they're signed and that gives you

2430
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,840
discovery is downgrade resistant

2431
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:03,040
and certificate validation is protected

2432
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,080
by

2433
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,520
um

2434
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,040
dnsec

2435
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,040
so the worst that an on-path adversary

2436
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:10,800
can do is interfere with the connection

2437
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,239
but not force downgrade

2438
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:16,799
next slide

2439
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,520
yeah there's some interesting things i

2440
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,440
was looking at to try and improve the

2441
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,800
efficiency in terms of the number of

2442
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:28,320
round trips once a cache is partly warm

2443
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:29,600
not completely

2444
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,040
hot

2445
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,760
for instance a name server named zone

2446
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:34,639
having

2447
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:36,400
some of the records have already been

2448
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:39,040
resolved but other ones are not

2449
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,400
is there a way to

2450
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,920
minimize the number of queries you need

2451
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:42,880
to do

2452
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,080
for a new name server in that zone

2453
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:47,920
and these are just sort of

2454
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,520
semantic tricks

2455
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,600
using a couple of different label types

2456
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,800
and

2457
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,040
an opt rr for

2458
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:59,840
allowing uh aggressive insect to be used

2459
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:03,120
probably worth not discussing it in

2460
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,719
depth here it's probably worth reading

2461
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:07,280
in the draft

2462
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,840
next slide

2463
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,880
and this is just

2464
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,199
uh explaining why i'm going down the

2465
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:16,400
road of

2466
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:19,199
it has to be dna second tlsa

2467
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:21,440
it's so that

2468
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:22,719
the clients

2469
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:24,960
have the ability to validate using only

2470
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:28,159
dns elements if you don't require

2471
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:30,560
tlsa to be used then clients can't

2472
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,159
validate using dane and they're forced

2473
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:34,159
to use web pki

2474
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:36,000
so i don't want that to be the case

2475
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,560
that's why i'm saying it's got to be

2476
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:41,280
uh tlsa and that means it has to be dnsx

2477
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:42,239
signed

2478
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:44,480
that's for minimum operability

2479
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:47,040
the resolvers have the option of not

2480
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,400
doing nsx validation and of doing web

2481
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,880
pki validation if they wish this isn't

2482
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,280
forcing the clients to do anything it's

2483
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,440
making sure that if the clients want to

2484
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:00,800
do dane validation that they can

2485
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,000
and the only things that actually have

2486
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,239
to be signed are the name server zones

2487
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:06,560
then the zones that contain the names of

2488
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,400
the name servers themselves

2489
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,960
it's usable for privacy on unsigned

2490
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:11,920
zones

2491
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,120
i'm not saying

2492
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:16,840
don't encourage dnsec i'm saying is

2493
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:20,800
optional next slide

2494
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,120
it's a work in progress hasn't had very

2495
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:26,320
much review because i didn't

2496
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:29,600
aggressively push it out earlier

2497
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:30,560
and

2498
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:32,800
taking this on as one of many projects

2499
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,800
and i'm trying to find good ways that

2500
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,600
are easy to implement and easy to deploy

2501
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,639
the minimum amount of additional work

2502
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:42,480
um for the

2503
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:45,040
specific things like dnst it's such a

2504
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,480
small draft

2505
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:49,199
i think it doesn't require much review

2506
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:51,600
it could probably even go straight to a

2507
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,760
working group last call with like only a

2508
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:54,639
few

2509
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:57,199
reviews and getting an early code point

2510
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:58,400
assigned

2511
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,480
so that implementations can be done

2512
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,960
it's trivial it's three flags

2513
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:05,600
uh the nsv is probably a little bit more

2514
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,440
controversial

2515
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,600
that i think is if i'm not mistaken

2516
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:11,840
that's sitting in deep private uh rather

2517
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:14,719
than dns off um and that's probably

2518
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:16,639
where the bulk of the discussion was

2519
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:17,840
going to happen

2520
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:21,280
plus a dot itself

2521
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,119
yeah that's

2522
01:35:23,119 --> 01:35:26,360
all i got

2523
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:31,040
hi uh thank you thank you thank you

2524
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,080
brian

2525
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,719
uh there are two people in the queue

2526
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:36,080
um

2527
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:38,639
three it's still we do have uh

2528
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:40,719
sufficient time to discuss

2529
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:44,960
uh benjamin bin please go ahead

2530
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:46,320
hello

2531
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,000
so so brian

2532
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,400
i i think it's fair to say that you and

2533
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:52,719
i are thinking along pretty similar

2534
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:53,760
lines

2535
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,639
uh yes for a lot of these topics

2536
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:59,280
um and i'm happy to have any pieces of

2537
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:02,239
these incorporated merged as uh people

2538
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:03,360
seated

2539
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,760
so you know obviously we we've had a lot

2540
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,320
of debate about exactly how the fine

2541
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,800
details of all of this should work but

2542
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:11,920
um

2543
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:13,199
but i think it's actually a good thing

2544
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:14,960
that we're that we're

2545
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:18,000
we've got uh lots of interest in trying

2546
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,400
to find a solution here and and similar

2547
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,840
ideas about what the solution should

2548
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,360
look like

2549
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:24,400
so

2550
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,639
in the details um

2551
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:29,119
i have two thoughts so well

2552
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:30,000
first

2553
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,679
i don't think that

2554
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:34,800
we are ready to to jump in and move

2555
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,199
forward with with any of any of these

2556
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:40,080
proposals i think um these are there's a

2557
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,600
bunch of deep questions here that we're

2558
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,760
not we're not just going to plow ahead

2559
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,840
oh the parent proposals talk about i

2560
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,040
think yeah

2561
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:50,080
yeah all of them yeah um

2562
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:50,800
but

2563
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,679
for dnst specifically

2564
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:57,199
um so my view is as you as i'm sure most

2565
01:36:57,199 --> 01:37:00,000
people here know but maybe not all um

2566
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,320
there is an adopted draft

2567
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:05,360
uh called service bindings for dns in

2568
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:08,400
the add working group that specifies a

2569
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:11,600
way to signal the supported

2570
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,639
um

2571
01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:16,320
the supported set of secure transports

2572
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,239
for

2573
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:20,960
for a dns server

2574
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,800
that draft uh

2575
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:24,639
so that draft is is essentially in my

2576
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:26,719
view very similar to dnst i would

2577
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:28,719
strongly prefer not to have two

2578
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:30,159
solutions there

2579
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:32,560
um you know the the

2580
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,719
the service bindings for dns draft is

2581
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:36,719
not in last call if you

2582
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:38,239
feel that there are changes you'd like

2583
01:37:38,239 --> 01:37:41,360
to see in it uh please take those to add

2584
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,360
and and we can discuss whatever changes

2585
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:44,400
you want if you think it should be a

2586
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:45,760
different rr type

2587
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,840
i think add and that draft is the place

2588
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:50,880
to have that discussion

2589
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,960
okay i haven't been following edd for a

2590
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:55,360
long time so i've uh i wasn't aware of

2591
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:56,480
that

2592
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,560
um so that's the yeah

2593
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:01,600
i actually did originally start with

2594
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:05,679
trying to do this using an sbcb binding

2595
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:07,280
but i found that

2596
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:09,040
i was using

2597
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:12,800
literally none of the the the

2598
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:16,000
value proposition of of that other than

2599
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
basically the flag signaling

2600
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,360
so i

2601
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,280
i basically did this as a shortcut to

2602
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:23,119
avoid having to

2603
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:25,920
make my draft long or to reference other

2604
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,400
things and i wanted to minimize the

2605
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,800
amount needed to deploy

2606
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:33,119
if somebody isn't already doing

2607
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:35,920
uh for instance https

2608
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:36,719
uh

2609
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:39,440
and hasn't already done any kind of

2610
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,280
service binding work

2611
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:44,080
i i the reason i went with uh this

2612
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:46,159
simple flag mechanism is it's so

2613
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:48,000
lightweight to actually implement i

2614
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,320
agree we shouldn't have two things it's

2615
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:51,920
simply a question of

2616
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:52,240
um

2617
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:54,239
[Music]

2618
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:56,239
which is more expedient

2619
01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:57,760
is there anything in

2620
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,920
the service binding

2621
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:00,880
things

2622
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:03,040
that actually add value that can't be

2623
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,600
done other ways in better ways i i think

2624
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,000
it's it's an offline discussion but yeah

2625
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,360
okay

2626
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,639
the other thing i'll mention is that the

2627
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:12,320
glue list delegations we're kind of in

2628
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:13,920
the wrong working group for this but the

2629
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:16,639
glueless delegations raise a bunch of

2630
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:19,600
very tricky privacy questions

2631
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:20,560
because

2632
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,159
as i understand it

2633
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:24,239
to get the to hit the performance

2634
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:25,760
targets that you're talking about we

2635
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:30,239
essentially disable the adot mechanisms

2636
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:32,080
when we're chasing these glueless

2637
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,600
delegations

2638
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:35,360
and those so it's assumed that the

2639
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:36,800
queries involved in the glueless

2640
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:39,360
delegation process are no longer

2641
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:40,560
sensitive

2642
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,560
i think that's only true

2643
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:43,360
if

2644
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:44,400
the

2645
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,040
child zone if the ns in the child zone

2646
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,760
is not only out of bailiwick the

2647
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,520
original ns record is not only out of

2648
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:54,400
bailiwick but also itself non-sensitive

2649
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,520
so if i have you know

2650
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,080
companyone.com

2651
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,560
and i have uh and i put my name servers

2652
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,560
under company1.net they're out of

2653
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:05,600
bailiwick but they're still disclosing

2654
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,119
the same piece of information

2655
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:11,440
potentially so correct uh yes i so i i

2656
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:12,719
would like to see a little more

2657
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:14,719
discussion of that i i think it's it

2658
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:16,400
makes the system easier to reason about

2659
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:18,159
if we don't have to restrict ourselves

2660
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:20,800
to particular architectures like that

2661
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:21,679
yeah

2662
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:23,920
and again i would point out that after

2663
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:26,080
having thought about it a bit more uh

2664
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,920
the blueness is a recommendation not a

2665
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:28,960
requirement

2666
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:30,800
the only thing i think actually ends up

2667
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:33,119
being a requirement is

2668
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:34,840
uh

2669
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:38,000
the well the the bailey wick issue i

2670
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,600
think is is core of the whole thing

2671
01:40:45,199 --> 01:40:46,639
okay

2672
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:47,920
thank you

2673
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:51,800
victor you're next

2674
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:30,639
okay uh do you want me to give a quick

2675
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:33,840
answer now do we have time

2676
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,400
uh the first one

2677
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,480
oh sorry

2678
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:41,040
yes please we we do have uh

2679
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,119
okay about seven

2680
01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:44,480
minutes

2681
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,679
on the the first question uh

2682
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:48,480
in

2683
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:49,440
my

2684
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:52,159
presentation i think i skipped over

2685
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:54,800
this is a detail but um or maybe i

2686
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:55,760
removed it it was in the other

2687
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,199
presentation

2688
01:42:57,199 --> 01:42:59,679
uh i'm not assuming

2689
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:00,900
that um

2690
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:02,080
[Music]

2691
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:04,400
uh that even if you have transport

2692
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:05,600
security

2693
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,920
that you can rely on that for data

2694
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:11,520
integrity so it and

2695
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,679
i i know this is probably a little bit

2696
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:15,440
controversial because i haven't actually

2697
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:17,920
shown my work but it is possible to

2698
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:20,480
poison tlds and you could become a man

2699
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:22,639
in the middle for a tld

2700
01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:26,560
at which point you can't necessarily

2701
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:28,960
become a tld for the tls situation but

2702
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:32,800
you can for the non-tls situation

2703
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:34,960
which means that you can

2704
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,159
serve up

2705
01:43:36,159 --> 01:43:38,400
bad data even if you weren't originally

2706
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,800
on path you make yourself on path with

2707
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,600
uh

2708
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:44,320
with poisoning a resolver

2709
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,199
um

2710
01:43:45,199 --> 01:43:47,679
anyway the the gist of it is

2711
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:51,360
with nsp you remove that as being

2712
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:53,760
even a remote possibility

2713
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:56,000
um

2714
01:43:56,239 --> 01:43:57,520
i can't remember the other part of the

2715
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:59,760
question about nsv

2716
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:00,560
um

2717
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,800
i'll answer the second question then if

2718
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:04,560
if i didn't answer

2719
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:06,560
adequately on the first question we can

2720
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:07,760
go back to that

2721
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:08,560
um

2722
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:11,040
for the motivation for getting rid of

2723
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:14,639
the prefixes it's mostly about

2724
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:16,639
the ability to

2725
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:20,480
uh get the signal in and um

2726
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,760
uh

2727
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,840
actually that's the tlsa part it's it's

2728
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,840
only the dnst that matters for the

2729
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:29,520
signaling the tlsa part could still be

2730
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:31,760
um

2731
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,440
underneath the individual i guess it's

2732
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:38,320
just to allow a more scalable uh

2733
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,800
population of a zone if you have the

2734
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:43,119
ability to do some kind of wild card and

2735
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:44,560
the only way to discover that you're

2736
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:46,639
able to use that wild card is if the

2737
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:48,560
owner name that happens to be the same

2738
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:51,119
and you can see that in an insect

2739
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:52,000
um

2740
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,119
an nsec

2741
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:56,080
record that shows that there is no tlsa

2742
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:58,880
record uh at that order name

2743
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,440
but that's that's mostly for optimizing

2744
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,360
the number of round trips on a warm

2745
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:04,320
cache

2746
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:07,360
not hot but warm

2747
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,199
yeah i i think it's probably a thing to

2748
01:45:09,199 --> 01:45:12,480
discuss on the building this morning

2749
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,400
okay

2750
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,239
there i just had a question for you

2751
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:21,920
about uh the nsv algorithm type for ds

2752
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,840
same question that i actually asked ben

2753
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:26,239
in the uh deprived meeting

2754
01:45:26,239 --> 01:45:29,280
um which is have you had any uh have you

2755
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:31,040
attempted to deploy

2756
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:33,600
this nsv algorithm to any

2757
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,719
um parent zones that are significant i

2758
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:37,760
mean obviously you can run your own

2759
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:39,040
parents own

2760
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:40,639
have you attempted to deploy it to any

2761
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:42,320
active ones and what was the results of

2762
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,440
that

2763
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:46,320
i tried a few um but i was limited

2764
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:48,239
mostly to whatever the uis were

2765
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:49,360
supporting

2766
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:50,159
um

2767
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:51,520
the uis

2768
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:52,639
differ

2769
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:54,320
but generally will have

2770
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:57,440
drop downs as opposed to free form uh

2771
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:59,360
for the algorithm values

2772
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:00,639
but i'm gonna

2773
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:03,679
work with my co-worker to try and do a

2774
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:06,000
more direct um

2775
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,400
api as opposed to ui since

2776
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,239
we're registered we can actually do that

2777
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:13,119
and send the results up to different

2778
01:46:13,119 --> 01:46:14,400
plds

2779
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,840
so i haven't

2780
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:18,320
succeeded but i haven't done the the

2781
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:21,840
more in-depth trials on that

2782
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:23,600
my

2783
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,840
suspicion is that as long as an

2784
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:28,560
algorithm has had

2785
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:31,280
a pull point assigned to it

2786
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:34,000
it's much easier to convince

2787
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,239
a registrar to update their ui to allow

2788
01:46:38,239 --> 01:46:41,040
the code point to be used the fact

2789
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:43,280
the main issue i think is going to be on

2790
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,119
the the parental side

2791
01:46:45,119 --> 01:46:46,560
and whether or not

2792
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:47,760
a

2793
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:49,440
registry is going to

2794
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:52,719
be willing to accept a plain text

2795
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:55,119
rather than a hashed

2796
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:59,520
ds value um by sticking with an existing

2797
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:00,960
ds hash

2798
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:01,840
um

2799
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:04,159
i see very little the likelihood of

2800
01:47:04,159 --> 01:47:07,199
there even being any contentiousness to

2801
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:09,600
this it's still doing

2802
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,840
uh comparisons of hashes

2803
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,520
and the only purpose of that is to

2804
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:15,199
validate existing

2805
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:18,320
parental records i.e the ns records

2806
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:19,760
so i i don't think there's going to be

2807
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:21,679
any pushback from

2808
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:23,679
registry operators which is where i

2809
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:25,280
think the the biggest part of friction

2810
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:26,480
is going to be

2811
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,480
for getting the optimization under the

2812
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:29,440
uh

2813
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:32,560
the dsp kind of mechanisms

2814
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:34,000
so report back about what you found

2815
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,600
would be great to the mailing list thank

2816
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:38,960
you absolutely for sure

2817
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:45,280
thank you uh victor please go ahead

2818
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,400
specific

2819
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:48,080
specifically on the question of

2820
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:49,520
registries

2821
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:52,080
uh if i remember correctly.de will not

2822
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:55,360
accept the the nsv dsr set because at

2823
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:56,960
the time at which you upload your ds

2824
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:59,280
record they actually do live queries

2825
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:00,719
against the child

2826
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:02,800
to make sure it has matching dns keys at

2827
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:05,679
the zone apex

2828
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:08,719
during epp and they'll reject the uh the

2829
01:48:08,719 --> 01:48:10,880
update so some registries will change

2830
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,480
their practice yeah this would require

2831
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:15,679
me going to peter and twisting his arms

2832
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:18,320
substantially or other people at d

2833
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:19,600
but um

2834
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:23,040
modulo then actually saying yeah okay um

2835
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,040
that's going to be a problem for de and

2836
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:27,199
i think uh there may also be

2837
01:48:27,199 --> 01:48:30,320
an issue with ca canada i think they

2838
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:32,800
require both of them to be presented i

2839
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,800
don't know what they do with the dns key

2840
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,320
other than just validating that it

2841
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,800
matches the what ends up in the ds that

2842
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:40,960
may or may not be a problem it remains

2843
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:44,199
to be seen

2844
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:51,840
okay thank you thank you brian thank you

2845
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,440
working group

2846
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:54,800
um

2847
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:58,840
you have enough directions and feedback

2848
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:02,639
brian i think

2849
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:05,840
you know

2850
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,920

time we are still and i think i said

2880
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,639
this in the chat we are still working on

2881
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:16,880
the ideal way to do

2882
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:19,360
agendas for the big ietf meetings and

2883
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:21,360
interims and

2884
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:23,199
the rate that we

2885
01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:25,599
accept new work but people should always

2886
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:27,599
feel free to

2887
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:29,679
work on things comment on drafts that

2888
01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:31,679
are of interest

2889
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:34,000
and in fact the more work has been done

2890
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,440
on a draft

2891
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:37,760
by the time it's out the adoption is

2892
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:40,080
requested the more likely it is to be in

2893
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:42,320
in some kind of shape to to

2894
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:44,080
really get into and solve remaining

2895
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:45,920
problems and and

2896
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:48,960

2900
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:03,040
have been a couple of drafts that were

2901
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:04,880
discussed today where

2902
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,880
it sounds like cross area

2903
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:09,520
review would be a really good idea

2904
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:10,560
um

2905
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,960
and it's not completely obvious

2906
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:14,960
immediately where to go for that review

2907
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,400
but that's something we can work on with

2908
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:18,639
warren and the iasj

2909
