will need a note taker

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,439

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,000
willing to be the note taker please

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,720

26
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,920
your notes

27
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,760
it's not an onerous job but it is an

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,760
important job

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,239
for us to be able to have a record of

30
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,599
the meeting

31
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,319
especially in case of other things don't

32
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,400
turn out the way we might imagine and

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
this becomes the only record we might

34
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,560
have normally we have the audio as well

35
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,560
so normally we can fix any notes from

36
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,959
the audio recording

37
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,519

input on and have reviewed

91
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,560
one good way to make sure that your

92
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,160
documents get reviewed is to review

93
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,720
other people's documents so

94
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,280
we always encourage people to do that

95
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,800
some particular ones of

96
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,039
interest right now are the ones on udp

97
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,560
options and

98
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,639
dscp related

99
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,960
ones which we'll talk about in a second

100
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,960

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,479
on revising the

111
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,560

in response to area director comments

113
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
uh there's a number of

114
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,360
ids that are very close to going to the

115
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,280
area director uh

116
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,319

for tunnels

118
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,599
these are very close and have been for a

119
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,960
long time but

120
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,520
really need attention from uh

121
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,479
uh

122
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,440
bob and david i would say to uh work

123
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,639

124
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,880
what needs to happen yeah l for uh

125
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,680
lfrs has been kind of pre-kind kind of

126
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,280
preempting us um i think we need a

127
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,400
a paragraph or two of carefully crafted

128
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,479
text for the first of them as noted on

129
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,960
the slide the second draft is also is is

130
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,879
is ready to go but uh the first one is

131
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,360
still caught still causing headaches and

132
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,960
bob and i just been putting too many

133
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,240
cycles into l4s and my day job continues

134
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,599
to get in the way of my ietf activity

135
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,479
okay

136
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,639
so

137
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,520
hopefully those will be wrapped up soon

138
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,639
then we had a working group last call on

139
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,919
three of the l4s related documents

140
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,240
and there is some time on the agenda to

141
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,200
discuss

142
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,479
that and

143
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,320
the updates to those documents later on

144
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:39,679
so

145
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,679
aside from those there are a number of

146
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,240
other working group drafts that are in

147
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,279

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,079
we need to add milestones for some of

175
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,079
the new work that's been brought in

176
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,440
which is

177
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,680
multipath dccp

178
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,040
dtls sctp and the

179
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,200
draft on considerations for signing new

180
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,200
dscps

181
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,440
working group chairs will work with the

182
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
authors offline and try to set up

183
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,200
milestones that we might actually make

184
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,519
our our track record on initial

185
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,079
milestone guesstimates is poor but uh

186
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,640
we'll make some guesstimates

187
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,760
and uh the first two items on this chart

188
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,959
are the

189
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,079
ecn

190
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,160
drafts that we've been

191
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,240
holding for a while that david will be

192
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,800
working with bob to try to get

193
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,920
updated

194
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,680
and then there's

195
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,800
still going to be a good amount of

196
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,880
activity to be done here on the l4s

197
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,040
drafts as we try to wrap

198
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,360
up on those

199
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,399
figuring out

200
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,200
how to how to proceed with some of the

201
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,440
um changes that the working group last

202
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,920
call is

203
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,479
calling for

204
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,839
and

205
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,240
we have no liaison updates but there are

206
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,519
some

207
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,160
liaison requests listed here

208
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,839
david or corey do you want to talk about

209
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,079
any of those

210
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,279
the wba is all acquired in the wba front

211
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,200
we sent the liaison response back over

212
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,800
to them and have not heard anything

213
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,040
since

214
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,320
okay

215
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,640
on

216
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,040
on the tram working group

217
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,240
we

218
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,000
will likely take over maintenance to

219
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,519
that working group when the working

220
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,480
group closes um as is normal for

221
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,560
transport area groups

222
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,279
this brings back the behave and nut

223
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,439
type activity to this working group here

224
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,959
oh and there's two

225
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,800
other drafts which i'll just draw your

226
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,959
attention to

227
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,040
one of these drafts have some slides at

228
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,800
the end of the slide deck if you'd like

229
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,240
to look

230
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,959
it's tcpls

231
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,800
and there is discussion of iccrg ccid5

232
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,720
use the mailing list

233
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,120
if you think it's appropriate use iccrg

234
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
list and we will

235
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,800
discuss the suitable venue for this

236
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,399
draft

237
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,519
after this ietf meeting

238
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,920
okay so for today the agenda is

239
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,560
summarized here uh we're going to have

240
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,519
martin talk about code of conduct a bit

241
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,200
then we have

242
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,920
updates on what's going on with the l4s

243
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,680
working group last call the updates to

244
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,800
the drafts

245
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,279
and the operational guidance and

246
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,120
if time should permit greg has some

247
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,639
material on the nqb drafts

248
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,720
then there's also a session on friday

249
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,079
which covers

250
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,320
uh everything else

251
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
so because we're sort of short on time i

252
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,079
want to try to get right to martin's

253
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,480
code of conduct

254
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,800
charts

255
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,079
thank you do you have the slide

256
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,399
yep

257
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,800
good day everyone um i just have the one

258
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,079
slide this isn't um

259
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,839
all that long

260
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,040
but uh

261
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,399
these are just a few highlights from the

262
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,399
code of conduct um the ieb and iesg are

263
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,040
have committed to

264
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,320
make another effort to um

265
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,000
encourage the tone of conversations in

266
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,440
the ietf

267
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,040
for reasons that i think are probably

268
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,079
obvious

269
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,120
um

270
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,360
there are some

271
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,440
uh remedies in the code of conduct for

272
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,839
people who aren't observing these these

273
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,600
tenets but for the time being we're

274
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,000
going to focus on as maybe you've might

275
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,600
have observed on the list

276
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,959
going to focus on just sort of

277
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,399
identifying behavior that we don't

278
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,079
believe corresponds to the code of

279
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,800
conduct um and uh calling it out and

280
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,040
hopefully establishing norms that get us

281
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,480
in a better place

282
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,160
uh i'm just going to ask you to do a

283
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
couple things uh number one

284
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,040
um

285
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,480
i want to highlight the second bowl

286
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,079
about limiting use of slang i mean i

287
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,760
think many of us are kind of good

288
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,079
friends and have have online you know

289
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,320
have offline relationships and we kind

290
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,680
of joke around with each other and a

291
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,199
little hard in a way that's sort of

292
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,600
jocular there's a lot of dry humor um

293
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,079
that i certainly appreciate um and

294
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,440
there's of course there's slang and it

295
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,519
just i i i when we're talking we're up

296
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,880
with the mic i really want people to

297
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,800
think about a newcomer who maybe doesn't

298
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,560
have english as a first language

299
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,000
and what kind of message that says on

300
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,920
how we receive ideas when

301
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,279
you know uh

302
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,800
like like when your friend gets a b and

303
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,079
like kind of say hey you know this idea

304
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,519
is garbage um

305
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,720
uh you may have a good beer and laugh

306
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,240
about that afterwards but that that kind

307
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,480
of sets a bad tone for other people

308
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
might have ideas that uh

309
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,240
they might think would be received

310
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,519
harshly

311
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,560
and then finally um

312
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,079
the other thing i would ask is i think

313
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,120
many of you

314
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,720
there are two ways to react to this

315
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,480
effort and this stuff about the code of

316
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,839
conduct one is to think about all the

317
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,839
ways in which you've been wronged uh and

318
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,160
many of you have been um but it'd be

319
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,760
much more constructive think about how

320
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,680
you know how maybe you have not lived

321
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,600
your best self uh in with respect to

322
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,040
this so i ask you all to use that

323
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,600
constructive attitude towards it and not

324
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,720
um

325
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,800
worry about the former uh we can't

326
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,839
really do anything what's happened in

327
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,519
the past we're gonna try to fix what

328
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,959
happens in the future so that's really

329
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,399
all i had does anyone have any comments

330
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,560
or questions

331
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,120
bob

332
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,720
go ahead bob

333
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,040
i just just wanted to give a data point

334
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,079
i'm probably getting about

335
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,880
as much email about l4s off list as on

336
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,000
list

337
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,920
and a number of people say they don't

338
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,439
want to talk on the list

339
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,800
yeah i mean you know obviously

340
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,440
you know yeah i mean like tswg obviously

341
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,160
is is um

342
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,440
a group where this has been a problem

343
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,199
historically specifically the air force

344
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,199
debate and um

345
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,199
oh yeah i it i mean certainly again i i

346
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,639
don't want this to be out pointy fingers

347
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,800
but like there's certainly

348
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,399
um

349
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,560
uh we do not this is not an environment

350
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,040
that is conducive to newcomers and and

351
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,959
uh differing opinions coming out into

352
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,360
the open so uh it's one reason i wanted

353
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,720
to personally get up in front of this

354
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
group and talk about this

355
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,160
any other comments i don't see anyone

356
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,759
else in the queue if there's nothing

357
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,600
else i'm gonna uh

358
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,279
sign off and let the meeting continue

359
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,439
thank you

360
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,480
hey i think i'm

361
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,920
talking about the working group last

362
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,839
call status and on l4s

363
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,400
so we had a working group last call from

364
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,119
late july through late august

365
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,959
on the three main drafts architecture

366
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,919
dual queue coupled and the

367
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,679
l4s id

368
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:24,880
and

369
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,679
notably we did not include the l4s ops

370
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,280
draft as part of the working group last

371
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,080
call

372
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,360
that was all

373
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,039
sort of according to

374
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,919
plans that had been discussed earlier

375
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,320
uh this was a

376
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,559
great working group last call in terms

377
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,760
of the number of responses we got which

378
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
um i know i've been

379
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,440
working in the itf for a long time and

380
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,039
don't recall ever seeing that many

381
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,960
responses to a working group last call

382
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,000
in uh

383
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,880
in this working group so that was uh

384
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,080
really good uh we got the full spectrum

385
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,760
of possible responses that you could

386
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,360
imagine

387
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,160
however i would say there was a

388
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,919
very strong overall support for

389
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,280
the l4s

390
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,240
set of documents that were reviewed

391
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,039
in addition there were uh several very

392
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,679
well explained concerns about uh the

393
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,320
documents moving forward at the moment

394
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,840
and uh

395
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,120
so we're trying to work through those

396
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,880
and uh

397
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,960
as the next steps from the working group

398
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,880
last call the editors have been making

399
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,760
updates and uh responding to comments on

400
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,520
the list

401
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,720
some of them are

402
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,360
similar to one another and we're closely

403
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,200
related so sometimes the threads i think

404
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,950
are a little bit

405
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,240
[Music]

406
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,080
hard to follow as

407
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,600
as they are in any ietf working group

408
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,720
but

409
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,280
in this case

410
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,480
sometimes they're a little more

411
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,559
complicated than uh

412
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,400
others it seems like

413
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,280
um

414
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,120
amongst the chairs we've gone through

415
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,480
all of the

416
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,400
messages that were received

417
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,640
and done some

418
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,120
tabulations and summaries and had some

419
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,320
discussion

420
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,679
and uh

421
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,440
there are a number of concerns that were

422
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,960
raised that were tracking uh the three

423
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,919
bullets i've listed here are the topmost

424
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,840
ones that i think we agree

425
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,080
are

426
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,559
definitely needing

427
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,799
work and most important to

428
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,520
get agreements on before moving forward

429
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,960
so

430
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,679
first of all there were a couple of

431
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,120
people who made

432
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,039
comments about uh going forward with l4s

433
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,600
versus um

434
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
and doing at the experimental

435
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,799
uh level like we've been planning uh

436
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,640
well

437
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,360
3168

438
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,280
sits out there um as standards track and

439
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,799
whether we should actually just be going

440
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,880
straight to standards track and uh

441
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,159
trying to obsolete 3168

442
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,480
the chairs didn't see that this is

443
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,320
something the working group really has

444
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,080
consensus on

445
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,880
uh

446
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,280
at least it didn't seem like it yet

447
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,320
however we thought there might be

448
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,679
appetite to

449
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,480
plan to do that in the future if the l4s

450
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,120
experiment is looking successful

451
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,919
so

452
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,960
we thought that uh before going forward

453
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,080
with this we should at least try to

454
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,159
sketch what the working group thinks the

455
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,799
long-term plans are that this is a part

456
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,440
of and that'll help the iesg understand

457
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,880
um

458
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,640
why we're we're doing this as

459
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
experimental now rather than standards

460
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,480
track now and and whether we plan to

461
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,159
reevaluate that at some point

462
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,000
then there are

463
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,640
some comments that we received regarding

464
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,440
rfc 4774

465
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,120
and

466
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,440
basically

467
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,679
the situation with regards to

468
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,320
some of the recommendations in that

469
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,640
document versus what we're doing with

470
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,960
l4s at the moment

471
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,320
it was unclear and uh

472
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
bob uh has been

473
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,200
uh working hard to clarify that and

474
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,120
recently posted some updates that need

475
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
to be discussed

476
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,480
figure out if people um

477
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,600
can understand and agree with what uh

478
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,240
what the plan is there

479
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,000
jonathan i see your hand is up once you

480
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,320
go ahead

481
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,679
so

482
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,960
i saw those uh updates pop up about an

483
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,480
hour ago

484
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,720
and a brief review

485
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,960
uh suggests that

486
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,159
um

487
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,640
alphabet is described as be as

488
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,200
conforming to roc 4774 option three

489
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,880
i believe that is inaccurate

490
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,960
um and of course we'll need to discuss

491
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,840
that further yeah jonathan this is david

492
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,880
i've been looking at at the notes um

493
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,559
this is first text

494
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,880
uh attempting to deal with them it is

495
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,799
going to be wide of the mark as is

496
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,559
typically the case

497
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,520
i believe what's intended here is it's

498
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,679
close to option three

499
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,000
but diverges in some

500
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,480
in some aspects uh if you look for the

501
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,200
word compromise you'll find the initial

502
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,880
attempt to write those aspects up which

503
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,120
is not as clear not as clear as it could

504
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,760
be and there will need to be significant

505
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,320
discussion to make sure we've got this

506
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,720
right and a particular we're just uh we

507
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,640
correctly describe the places in which

508
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,120
it does not align with options does not

509
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,679
align with option three

510
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,320
no i i think the divergence is more

511
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,960
serious than mere um

512
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,400
uh compromise

513
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,799
i think it is not options at all yeah

514
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:57,840
i'm not gonna

515
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,720
i don't want to go uh split split hairs

516
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,919
on words um there is divergence uh we

517
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,039
get to sort it out on the list

518
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,520
yeah i think we have uh time

519
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,120
actually later in the agenda to talk

520
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,919
about those changes

521
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,080
more specifically

522
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,720
um but i mean it is jonathan it is as a

523
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
foundation i think it is clear all

524
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,799
concerned that um

525
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,840
l4s does not fully

526
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,320
comply with option with uh option three

527
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,200
uh which is a peaceful coexistence and

528
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,159
uh

529
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,760
i forget i think it's peace code just

530
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,400
something or something like that with uh

531
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,480
existing traffic and the extent to which

532
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,799
it does not and whether that's a problem

533
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,200
are things things that that the working

534
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,159
group gets gets gets gets to sort out in

535
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,159
discussion

536
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,120
so your concern that that compliance is

537
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,480
claimed is

538
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,039
uh it is noted based on having read the

539
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,640
text that's not where the final text is

540
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,200
going to line up

541
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,640
right

542
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,520
so thank you and uh

543
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,240
and

544
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,880
yeah finally the third item i think that

545
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,679
uh

546
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,960
was a big one for us was uh there's a

547
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,679
disagreement um in the comments we

548
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,440
received about

549
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,799
uh the sort of results of uh

550
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,279
risk analysis and uh

551
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,880
uh how likely

552
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,360
there are to be problems and if the

553
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,000
is significant enough to

554
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,559
motivate not going forward or

555
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,440
not

556
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,880
so

557
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,559
we

558
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,360
have

559
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,039
more of a challenge with that one i

560
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,840
think

561
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,760
because uh we're dealing with the

562
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,320
people's impressions and perceptions

563
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,760
of uh

564
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,840
of how things are going to function and

565
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,360
what the state of

566
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,679
deployed base of the internet is and

567
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,320
what will happen during the experiment

568
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,440
however

569
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,640
we think that the

570
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,039
outside of

571
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,039
what you might call

572
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,120
the rough it looks like the working

573
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,919
group

574
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,720
responses are accepting these risks and

575
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,080
are informed

576
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,520
of

577
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,039
the the data

578
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,080
that has been brought forward about the

579
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,000
potential problems

580
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,480
so we do want to make sure that that's

581
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,559
the case and confirm that the working

582
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,880
group is accepting

583
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,919
the risks of l4s experimentation as it's

584
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,120
been described

585
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,400
so there will have to be a little bit

586
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,120
more discussion around that

587
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,559
and confirmation through the mailing

588
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,760
list

589
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,279
and there are a number of additional

590
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,200
concerns that need more work these were

591
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,039
the big ones that we had agreed amongst

592
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,240
the chairs

593
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,039
that

594
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,960
could drive

595
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,120
interims if needed but were most

596
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,919
important to resolve

597
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,640
a number of them are

598
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,799
we're considering lesser criticality

599
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,240
for instance

600
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,640
there are a number about specifics of

601
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,960
the dual queue construction

602
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,480
but since that is a um

603
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,320
sort of optional component

604
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,240
of the l4s architecture there are

605
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,000
alternatives to it

606
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,200
uh

607
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,840
it's not something we think

608
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,600
is blocking everything the way that

609
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,879
these other big issues are

610
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,799
and that's all i have on the working

611
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,240
group last call

612
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,360
status

613
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,960
is going to present the updates to the

614
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,919
drafts okay a little bit more on that

615
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,120
that last topic on dual queue um dual

616
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,480
queue is

617
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,799
is fundamentally do dual

618
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,159
uh dual pi 2. um there are certain

619
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,240
decisions that have been made about the

620
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,880
specific algorithms that are used that

621
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,440
have specific consequences there are

622
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,840
other uh aqms that could be designed for

623
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,320
example a dual q algorithm based uh

624
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,480
based on caudal uh which would make

625
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,679
different decisions with different

626
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,039
consequences

627
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,919
uh the the general view the chairs have

628
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,120
of this is experimenting with uh aqm

629
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,080
algorithms is fine and as wes said gokus

630
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,880
is definitely not the only aqm you can

631
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,919
use for lforest or other opportunities

632
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,640
um and uh our view is that of it doesn't

633
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,799
have to be perfect as an atrium to

634
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,880
experiment with uh for uh for these

635
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,880
reasons

636
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,080
and for time i'm going to switch to bob

637
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,480
slides now

638
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,120
go ahead bob all right there can

639
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,880
everyone hear me

640
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,919
can one person hear me

641
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,600
great

642
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,960
yep good

643
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,840
okay um so

644
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,279
um

645
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,159
the giraffes have um that the draft

646
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,159
numbers are there

647
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,000
um there's a number of other people have

648
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,320
helped with this but they're the three

649
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,520
main authors

650
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,279
if i um move to the next or if you could

651
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,679
move to the next slide please

652
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,120
just to recap for anyone that doesn't

653
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,520
know what l4s is

654
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,200
um

655
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,720
essentially

656
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,480
it enables

657
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,440
more high fidelity marking uh more high

658
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,559
fidelity

659
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,799
um congestion control

660
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,880
so that you don't have this compromise

661
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,320
between either

662
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,840
low queueing delay

663
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,559
low

664
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,120
amplitude variation of queuing delay

665
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,320
or low utilization

666
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,000
so you can have

667
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,399
tighter variation of the congestion

668
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,480
control

669
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
and that gives you

670
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,640
a more scalable

671
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,559
and lower delay

672
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,200
and particularly lower delay at um

673
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,000
at the tail of the latency

674
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,159
um

675
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,520
which um

676
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,080
is necessary for or is

677
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,240
desirable shall we say for um

678
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,039
more interactive communication

679
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,080
um particularly with high bandwidth at

680
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,399
the same time so you can have both

681
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,039
high bandwidth and low delay and

682
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,600
fully utilizing the capacity next

683
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,080
so um

684
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,760
just before we get on to the drafts just

685
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,440
a few other things that have been going

686
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,240
on

687
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,600
um

688
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,840
pete heist's continuing testing and

689
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,120
evaluation and jonathan's um

690
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,559
on on

691
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,480
in a sort of red team

692
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,919
um

693
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,679
characterization of that

694
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,679
um it's worth going have a look at that

695
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,640
link there look into all those tests and

696
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,039
i i guess the main things that have been

697
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,520
coming out recently are a work on

698
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,159
um bursts from bursty lynx upstream of

699
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,520
l4s and

700
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,039
unbestie flows

701
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,720
and um

702
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,480
i i'll i'll talk later about um

703
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,919
particularly the latter of those but

704
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,799
also well both of them actually um

705
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,240
but uh

706
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,559
so these are really heads up in fact the

707
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,080
whole presentation is heads up because

708
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,200
there's not really enough time to go

709
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,880
into everything that's happening in

710
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,240
detail

711
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,679
so the next one

712
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,279
um is that

713
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,320
um

714
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
tokay and

715
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,159
eric dimaze

716
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,600
have

717
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,279
released a patch and it's been applied

718
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,520
to

719
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,240
the release of limits that's currently

720
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,320
being merged in

721
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,720
for the for net next

722
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,760
which

723
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,960
essentially

724
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,039
takes an existing part of fq coddle that

725
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,159
was designed for data centers with a low

726
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,320
shallow immediate threshold and makes it

727
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,399
so that it will

728
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,480
it can only be

729
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,799
set up so that it could only

730
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,799
triggers for east t1 packets and these

731
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,799
d0 packets go past it

732
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,000
um to the deeper deeper coddle machinery

733
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,159
behind it

734
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,080
toki has done that with a

735
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,399
nice

736
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,840
using using the classification

737
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,360
architecture so with the traffic control

738
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,760
command you can you can set it up so you

739
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,880
can also use diff service you want um

740
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,279
as part of the classifier but um i've

741
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,880
given the command there

742
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,320
to give the ust1 field as the classifier

743
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,240
for that threshold and then you've got

744
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,120
alpha support in fq coddle so people can

745
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,279
test it use it try it out all the rest

746
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,519
of it

747
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,679
so

748
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,399
please go and have a look at that um

749
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,519
and actually it also points there to

750
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,600
section 527 of

751
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,360
the rfc on fq coddle which

752
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,200
included that facility

753
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,799
right when it was

754
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,640
specified at the start

755
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,279
except for the um ability to

756
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,080
to separate the ecn field into the two

757
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,679
code points which now tokay has enabled

758
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,200
um and eric previously

759
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,559
the other thing i want to give a heads

760
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,240
up on is please go and have a look at

761
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,840
stuart's emails

762
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,279
um

763
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,840
i won't presume to summarize them but um

764
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,080
it's important people read them

765
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,120
um

766
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,320
essentially

767
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,399
about um

768
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,480
where where apple stands or where stuart

769
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,799
stands on apple's experiments with ecn

770
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,039
um so that's well worth

771
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:37,360
um

772
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,559
[Music]

773
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,360
having a look at

774
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,120
i wonder whether um shall we get to the

775
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,159
end of the slides and see what the

776
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,200
time's like

777
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,799
yep

778
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,080
yeah thanks next slide then

779
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,640
um

780
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,720
so

781
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,320
the i've got

782
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,720
three slides one on each draft and this

783
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,080
is a summary

784
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,320
so as well said

785
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,440
um

786
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,360
there was a lot of response

787
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,240
and you know other than the sort of plus

788
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,159
ones and yes i agree or don't agree or

789
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,200
whatever there was um some substantial

790
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,720
reviews and shown here um for each draft

791
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,519
from

792
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,039
each person

793
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,399
um and i've added on the end

794
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,279
um

795
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,320
you know

796
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,679
conversation that's been going on with

797
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,399
the chairs particularly about the text

798
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,440
on 4774

799
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,480
and

800
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,919
also the authors themselves have

801
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,399
generated quite a bit of um

802
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,720
churn in the in the by noticing things

803
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,120
in the drafts um while we've been

804
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,320
editing it all

805
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,640
so um

806
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,440
i would also say that the

807
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,360
probably the

808
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,960
the

809
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,159
left hand

810
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,200
most

811
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,880
um reviews

812
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,960
particularly the the left

813
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,159
foremost

814
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,039
um

815
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,799
have done a really good

816
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,039
pass through um

817
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,199
a couple of them all three documents and

818
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,199
two of them two of the documents

819
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,719
and picked up a lot of things so thank

820
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,159
you very much and thank you very much

821
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,359
everyone who has contributed

822
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,159
um

823
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,280
one thing to explain there's the

824
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,679
exclamation mark under neil um neil

825
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,760
cardwell

826
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,639
uh

827
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,918
that

828
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,520
is something neil didn't actually review

829
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,040
that document but it was a passing

830
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,079
comment

831
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,359
on on the tcpm mailing list where i said

832
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,679
something about um linux's

833
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,199
um cubic

834
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,719
response

835
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,359
and um neil said hey no that's not right

836
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:42,560
um

837
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,839
and

838
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,918
i'd got it from someone else and that's

839
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,440
what we've been working on the basis of

840
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,520
and i'd never actually checked the code

841
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,960
and um

842
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,000
it wasn't right and that meant

843
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,159
some of the references

844
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,640
we use where we did all the original

845
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,079
maths and things

846
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,000
in um

847
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,800
that the dual queue relies on

848
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,760
were

849
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,160
um had errors in them it turns out the

850
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,000
errors didn't actually change

851
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,640
anything anything in the code because

852
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,320
most of the code relied on the worst

853
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,720
case to reno not cubic but

854
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,480
it just meant that we couldn't refer to

855
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,760
all these papers we'd written all the

856
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,119
cubic stuff in

857
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,680
so essentially had to rewrite all that

858
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,160
um so that we could refer to it and and

859
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,119
that's made appendix c in the dual q

860
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,359
draft a lot longer uh because that has

861
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,240
sort of re-create all that maths and and

862
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,760
in ascii

863
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,599
and um

864
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,359
and

865
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,200
that that caused a lot of work which is

866
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,800
one of the reasons why

867
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,160
um all the responses to everyone else's

868
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,599
[Music]

869
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,920
comments took so long to get started

870
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,480
because i wanted to make sure that we

871
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,640
had the foundations there again and it

872
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,079
turned out the foundations hadn't

873
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,440
actually changed

874
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,400
um

875
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,800
so apologies to everyone for

876
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,240
not getting to respond i mean some

877
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,320
people are responded fairly soon but

878
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,400
um a lot of those responses have come in

879
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,560
in the last week or so

880
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,880
and right over the last weekend

881
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,040
and so um

882
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,640
but but i guess once you're in working

883
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,000
group last call

884
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,920
you sort of get out of the itf meeting

885
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,760
cycles a bit and for instance you're

886
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,200
allowed to post

887
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,520
um drafts even when the servers are

888
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,640
closed and things like that so um

889
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,079
um please bear with bear with us and

890
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,520
i'm sure the chairs will give some time

891
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,599
for people to now look at the new

892
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,680
um text that has

893
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,920
now appeared and i can i can confirm

894
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,520
that i believe

895
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,200
all those reviews

896
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,000
um

897
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,200
have been

898
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,040
or i've attempted to address all the

899
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,880
points in all those reviews some of

900
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,240
which were

901
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,160
considerably um

902
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,520
deep

903
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,599
um involving quite large amounts of

904
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,880
change

905
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,839
so thank you everyone and if you think

906
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,440
yours hasn't been

907
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,480
um

908
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,240
dealt with your review of the the

909
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,680
documents then

910
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,560
um that means i've missed it

911
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,560
um

912
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,000
so

913
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,800
um

914
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,480
i i've also

915
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,320
because of the rush in the last few days

916
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,480
i i normally give a summary of the diffs

917
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,000
of each draft i will do that on the

918
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,280
mailing list

919
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,440
rather than having to rely on going and

920
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,760
looking at the full text diffs with

921
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,040
which don't tell you which of the

922
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,960
important diffs compared to the

923
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,760
um unimportant editorial stuff or less

924
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,800
important

925
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,760
um and apologies again for just in time

926
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,720
posting

927
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,880
now the next if you can move the next

928
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,200
three slides on the next slide

929
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,560
i'll go through each slide giving

930
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,119
normative technical editorial

931
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,560
changes

932
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,400
um and on the alphas architecture there

933
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,760
are no normative changes because it's

934
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,599
not a normative document

935
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,520
in fact it doesn't even have a section

936
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,680
saying anything about must and should

937
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,680
and what and what they mean it doesn't

938
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,960
refer to rfc 2119 about that sort of

939
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,640
stuff

940
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,320
um so

941
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,920
it's gone through four deltas since

942
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,960
july

943
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,040
the last ietf cycle

944
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,920
um

945
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,680
one of which was just a

946
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,040
um

947
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,920
a

948
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,359
uh

949
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,440
a formatting change to move to the new

950
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,000
version of the rfc xml so i did that as

951
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,160
a separate change so it didn't pollute

952
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,119
the diffs

953
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,040
and that's the case for all all three

954
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,480
drafts

955
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,640
um

956
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,720
i i've said there are no technical

957
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,960
changes in the off-road architecture

958
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,160
i mean all the editorial stuff is pretty

959
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,680
technical

960
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,040
um but it's not it's not changing

961
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,280
the description the technical stuff it's

962
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,040
it's clarifying it so

963
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,640
i would you know there's no technical

964
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,160
changes

965
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,000
um but

966
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,440
there there was quite considerable

967
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,520
rewriting of the descriptions of the

968
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,839
technical stuff

969
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,839
um

970
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,200
so i i won't go through all those sub

971
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,920
bullets on editorial um you can see them

972
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,720
there

973
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,480
read them in your own time

974
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,599
i'll just pick out um a couple

975
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,119
the um there's some new thoughts on

976
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,520
traffic uh well particularly on rate

977
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,880
policing just

978
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,960
how that might uh um the interactions

979
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,640
with rate policing that's not rate

980
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,440
policing for l4s it's if alpha s traffic

981
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,839
hits a rate please so what happens

982
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:26,880
um

983
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,880
and um

984
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,320
otherwise let's move on next slide

985
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,000
dropped a second and asked a question

986
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,720
that came up in the chat was moving back

987
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,079
to this chart

988
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,880
um were you intending these uh check

989
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,880
marks to represent

990
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,960
the people whose comments you think are

991
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,760
uh fully addressed and

992
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,400
uh taken care of in the update or is

993
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,280
this

994
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,320
uh the

995
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,240
uh exhaustive list of comments you

996
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,440
looked at

997
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,200
this is the exhaustive list

998
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,880
um it doesn't

999
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,079
include

1000
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,160
comments that were i don't i don't want

1001
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,920
alfres at all and these are the reasons

1002
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,040
why

1003
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,319
that i couldn't really do anything about

1004
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,319
in the drafts these are these are

1005
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,280
reviews of the drafts

1006
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,240
okay well i think some of those comments

1007
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,839
uh

1008
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,240
can't be discarded in that way

1009
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,319
no no no i don't intend to discard them

1010
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,040
but

1011
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,160
um i mean say for instance jonathan's um

1012
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,800
i i i was going to go on the list now i

1013
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,880
i needed to get the draft sorted i was

1014
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,720
going to go on the list and and talk

1015
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,839
about those

1016
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,680
um points but

1017
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,400
i could you know the the

1018
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,880
attempts we're doing to to talk about

1019
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,640
the deficiencies and and things in

1020
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,040
um the drafts

1021
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,560
uh i think we'll address those things

1022
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,960
but it's it's difficult to tie them to a

1023
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,839
particular thing we're doing in the

1024
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,599
draft because that's sort of okay

1025
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,800
could you make a list somewhere for just

1026
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,839
process record of the people whose

1027
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,480
comments you've seen but fall into the

1028
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,520
category

1029
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,839
fall into roughly that roughly that

1030
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,440
category of

1031
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,319
uh

1032
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:09,680
of uh

1033
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,720
uh not seeing specific draft updates

1034
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,000
yeah

1035
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,680
jonathan and then other people who said

1036
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,200
i agree with jonathan

1037
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,720
so okay but

1038
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,440
we

1039
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,960
if you could send a note to the list

1040
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,720
that basically summarizes the peoples

1041
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,440
whose names aren't on this slide because

1042
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,319
of

1043
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,760
what you've just got what you've just

1044
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,599
gone through uh we would at least

1045
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,000
acknowledge that as part of the process

1046
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,880
um those comments are those comments are

1047
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,880
there and uh

1048
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,520
we will we'll get are in need of being

1049
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,720
dealt with

1050
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,200
i mean for instance pete heists

1051
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,319
no no no no

1052
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,880
no no this is a disgusting process this

1053
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,720
is a process yeah i know i know let me

1054
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,359
just say this um pete heiss gave her um

1055
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,280
pointers to all his experiments and then

1056
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,440
he reviewed the three drafts and at the

1057
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,839
moment i've only dealt

1058
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,839
but i've still got or someone

1059
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,520
some one of the proponents has got to

1060
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,400
deal with

1061
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,160
um talking about each of the each of the

1062
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,839
points he's raised obviously a lot of

1063
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,319
them have come up in in talking about

1064
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,880
the the um the points he's made

1065
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,240
reviewing the

1066
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,920
um

1067
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,480
reviewing the drafts but um you know

1068
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,640
just to just for a process point of view

1069
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,880
yes we need to pick up each point

1070
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,400
right and from personal friends i'm

1071
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,880
asking you simply a summary that lists

1072
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,839
lists off people um whose names aren't

1073
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,280
on this slide but nonetheless have made

1074
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,359
comments that um that will need to be

1075
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,280
dealt with

1076
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,800
yeah okay

1077
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,200
thank you

1078
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,160
right so if we move forward again

1079
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,920
um right so

1080
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,839
i

1081
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,119
guess here

1082
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,119
there's a different characterization

1083
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,200
um with a lot more normative

1084
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,200
um bullets and and less other

1085
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,280
um actually the first two sub-bullets of

1086
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,839
normatives haven't yet involved any

1087
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:01,200
change uh but i'll go through all four

1088
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,440
and i've got a um spare slide on the on

1089
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,200
the last two sub bullets of normative if

1090
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,319
we need it

1091
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:07,280
um

1092
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,400
so

1093
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,839
firstly on the prague requirements

1094
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,280
particularly on the one about um

1095
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,520
uh detecting

1096
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,400
uh classic ecn aqms

1097
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,560
as amazingly didn't have any comments

1098
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,839
except for jake

1099
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,680
so in fact all through since we've

1100
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,280
written all that no one has commented on

1101
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,200
that normative text in in section 4.3

1102
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,640
um

1103
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,160
except for jake

1104
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,640
and and jake tried to improve it i've

1105
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,720
i've responded to jake and he probably

1106
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,440
had no time to process it um because it

1107
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,280
was yesterday i think it feels like a

1108
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,680
hours ago but i think it was yesterday

1109
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,720
um

1110
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,319
and

1111
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,000
so there's likely to be some more

1112
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,079
conversation on that but you know

1113
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,280
i i think jake's suggestions ended up

1114
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,079
making it more lacks not more strict

1115
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,680
and um so i haven't changed it yet

1116
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,040
um

1117
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,359
the characterization of it would be that

1118
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,240
the

1119
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,319
the text in the draft

1120
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,119
is conditioned on problems and jake was

1121
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,119
trying to condition it on uh the

1122
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,160
sender's

1123
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,920
uh what the center does on whether it's

1124
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,560
an fq or a dual queue but we we

1125
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,000
deliberately didn't want to do that

1126
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,760
because it the center doesn't know for

1127
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,520
sure what it is

1128
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,760
so we we tried to condition it on

1129
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,960
problems

1130
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,920
um in quotes you know what

1131
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,359
um

1132
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,200
detecting problems

1133
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,400
so anyway there's like to be more on

1134
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,359
that

1135
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,040
um

1136
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,960
the

1137
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,760
sorry

1138
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,040
someone trying to speak

1139
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,279
jake

1140
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,520
uh sure thanks um

1141
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,640
i did send a response actually after

1142
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,720
this meeting started so you probably

1143
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,000
haven't read it yet uh i guess the point

1144
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,880
i was trying to get at is

1145
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,560
uh

1146
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,000
which i said in the email maybe you

1147
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,920
could just read it i don't think we have

1148
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,079
to beat it to death here

1149
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,440
it's really just conditioning on

1150
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,760
problems without requiring attempts to

1151
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,680
detect the problems is where i'm a

1152
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,599
little bit stuck and so i think i agree

1153
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,200
that we'll we'll have to hammer that out

1154
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,319
a little more

1155
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,640
um but uh

1156
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,920
it seems likely something can be done

1157
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,839
okay cool

1158
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,599
yeah um

1159
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,000
there's there's a huge

1160
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,319
lump of new um

1161
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,560
subsection of of the

1162
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,520
um

1163
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,880
about that particular bullet about um

1164
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,200
classicity and akm detection

1165
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,880
that it none of it is normative in

1166
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,040
itself but it essentially

1167
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,240
justifies it says what the rfcs say it

1168
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,400
says what um

1169
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,040
or intends to say what l4s does and

1170
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,400
doesn't comply within those rfcs and and

1171
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,000
gives justification for what it doesn't

1172
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,280
comply with

1173
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,160
and

1174
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,640
some context so that certainly that

1175
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,920
that's what um

1176
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,599
david and wes have been just been

1177
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,760
talking about and that certainly has

1178
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,280
only just appeared for people so that

1179
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,839
would require some bashing i'm sure

1180
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,880
um it has already had some bashing um

1181
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,800
from the chairs off list

1182
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,839
um

1183
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,359
but um

1184
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,359
we'll see and and

1185
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,280
to a certain extent that bashing had to

1186
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,359
stop for the meeting um and hadn't

1187
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,280
necessarily and i'm not saying that the

1188
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,720
chairs approved the text that's there

1189
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,079
although it did get better from what

1190
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,839
they did

1191
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,119
the

1192
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,640
next two

1193
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,079
they're fairly

1194
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,760
sort of tinkering type things

1195
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,359
and it may be best actually to deal with

1196
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,280
them with the spare slide

1197
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,800
um how are we doing for time with

1198
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,119
[Music]

1199
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:54,880
for this topic

1200
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,839
yeah

1201
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,960
uh i didn't just said there's five

1202
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,319
minutes to go

1203
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,599
okay right

1204
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:06,560
okay

1205
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,040
that's fine then um

1206
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,920
let's jump to the final slide this final

1207
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,599
spare side then for those last two

1208
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,599
bullets keep going

1209
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,400
no the the the spare slide

1210
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,280
um right at the end

1211
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,839
right so

1212
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,359
here um

1213
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,680
there are there are three areas where

1214
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,760
normative text

1215
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,040
it's difficult to say whether it's

1216
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,960
changed it's it's

1217
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,160
um the subject of the text of the of the

1218
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,040
um

1219
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,200
normative statement has changed to

1220
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,880
correct it but just

1221
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,359
th these aren't actual diffs um they're

1222
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,240
just

1223
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,400
sort of paraphrased diffs if you like

1224
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,400
this is the actual text now

1225
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,839
and the emboldening is just the main

1226
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:53,359
changes otherwise it gets really

1227
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,319
difficult to parse

1228
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,559
so the first one is in a section on on

1229
00:47:58,559 --> 00:47:59,440
an

1230
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,200
ifa

1231
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,359
node that's doing

1232
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,640
classification on the ecn field is also

1233
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,559
or wants to be transport aware or is

1234
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,040
willing has transport awareness

1235
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,720
capabilities

1236
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,160
um

1237
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,359
and

1238
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,200
just that text has been in there right

1239
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,640
from the start

1240
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,520
and

1241
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,640
um haven't really looked at it for years

1242
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,240
and it said that

1243
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,960
it treats a c packet the same as the

1244
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,440
most recent ect packet

1245
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,359
and when i looked at that i thought you

1246
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,280
know with the with the more

1247
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,200
um recent

1248
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,119
considerations of vpns i thought oh god

1249
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,280
if there's a vpn that's going to

1250
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,240
um

1251
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,559
um you know be switching about all the

1252
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,880
time so we've made it

1253
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,599
that it it should only consider a

1254
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,040
consider ce

1255
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,440
as he's t0 if all the previous packets

1256
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,319
have been

1257
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,400
um sd0

1258
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,200
that obviously has connotations

1259
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,359
um when you've got transient flow state

1260
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,960
um as to what all means um so there may

1261
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,280
be some bashing to do on that text

1262
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,400
um

1263
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,119
the

1264
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:08,640
the other two

1265
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,319
they were both

1266
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:11,599
about

1267
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,359
um

1268
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,280
where it said the operator did something

1269
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,839
and it and it actually then implied that

1270
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,760
the operator across their whole network

1271
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,359
did it rather than alphas nodes so that

1272
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:22,480
first one

1273
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,680
um

1274
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,599
we made it the process of it including

1275
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,200
additional traffic

1276
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,400
rather than

1277
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,240
the operator

1278
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,480
so it didn't really change the sense of

1279
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,240
the mandatory statement but it changed

1280
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,200
the

1281
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,960
subject of it

1282
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,599
and um the last one

1283
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,960
both pete heist and um

1284
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,880
stuart picked this one up

1285
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,400
um

1286
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,440
and and i'm still not sure whether it's

1287
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,520
right or even necessary so

1288
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,440
maybe we can take that discussion to the

1289
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,480
list

1290
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,599
but it's essentially if if an l4s is

1291
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,359
about excluding

1292
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:00,480
certain

1293
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,920
um

1294
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,880
um

1295
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,640
machines that are trying to you know

1296
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,680
wanting to use l4s from being able to

1297
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,280
you know as a sort of commercial or

1298
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,440
security thing uh there's some

1299
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,040
exceptions in the in the draft that

1300
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,520
allow operators to do that and it's

1301
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,440
about um

1302
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,359
whether they should then treat east to

1303
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,280
one of these t-zero or not

1304
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,800
and um

1305
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,559
i don't know whether we need to say that

1306
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,400
must not um

1307
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,440
it's

1308
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,920
um it was designed to not add further

1309
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,200
confusion

1310
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,400
um as more alfres knows to put in but um

1311
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,079
yeah there's a debate to be had on that

1312
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,800
one so if we go back to the dual queue

1313
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,040
so that um sorry to

1314
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,640
the uh

1315
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,760
alphas id slide just to finish it off

1316
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,079
one more one more back

1317
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,319
to have any time for comments we have to

1318
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,720
start okay soon as we're taking time

1319
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:57,359
from the abstract now yeah okay so um

1320
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:58,160
just

1321
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,599
move to heads up then rather than

1322
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,040
explaining things

1323
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,280
there was

1324
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,119
technical new technical texts put in

1325
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:07,200
about limiting packet bursts both from

1326
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,880
upstream links particularly from

1327
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,800
upstream links but also

1328
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,800
added some open questions on bursty

1329
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,880
traffic and had some conversation on the

1330
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,119
list about that and and trying to do

1331
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,200
more work on that

1332
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,319
and

1333
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:23,280
next slide the editorial we can jump

1334
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,400
um

1335
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,000
i've explained

1336
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
the stuff that got put into the dual

1337
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,960
queue

1338
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,359
um which is the fourth sub bullet there

1339
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,599
about choosing the coupling factor and

1340
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,559
rtt independence and all the maths there

1341
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,160
and

1342
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,400
again that's where the stuff on

1343
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,480
potentially bursty traffic

1344
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,400
um or the bursty trafficking the

1345
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,760
potential problem

1346
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,880
and potential solution is in appendix a

1347
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,000
um

1348
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,800
there's been some discussion on the

1349
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,960
parameters in the pi 2 parameters paper

1350
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,640
that's been updated

1351
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,040
and that's

1352
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,160
the

1353
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,839
sorry i'm working backwards up the

1354
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:06,720
bullet sorry about this um

1355
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,160
and

1356
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,000
there's also been

1357
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,680
an improved explanation of the need for

1358
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,280
the conditional schedule based on

1359
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,480
gauri's

1360
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,640
review so that's that's um all the

1361
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,400
drafts that you know please go and look

1362
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,720
at all those points just finally next

1363
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,040
steps and then we're done

1364
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,559
um

1365
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:27,280
so as we've said like to be follow-ups

1366
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,160
in the next few days and weeks maybe

1367
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,520
um

1368
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,800
and then i don't know what's going to

1369
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,880
happen that's up to the chairs

1370
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,839
and

1371
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,359
those things expected to happen in

1372
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,520
parallel were on the slides from last

1373
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,800
time as well

1374
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,720
um they're the technical work that will

1375
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,640
continue on i'm sure

1376
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,799
thank you

1377
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,839
any

1378
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,880
discussion and comments

1379
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:58,960
uh

1380
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,400
do we have time

1381
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,920
from the outside

1382
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,319
go ahead

1383
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,640
uh

1384
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,200
thank you for that presentation bob uh

1385
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,880
you mentioned my name on one of the

1386
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,280
slides and said you wouldn't presume to

1387
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,960
try to sum up what i said which i

1388
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,359
understand

1389
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,800
took me while thinking about it

1390
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,119
i'll try to give a summary now

1391
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:24,160
um

1392
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,800
of my main points there

1393
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,800
in recent years on the internet there's

1394
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,800
been lots of work increasing bandwidth

1395
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,880
that's been enormously successful gone

1396
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,240
from dial up to megabits to gigabits

1397
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,800
but working latency latency under load

1398
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,040
has not improved

1399
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,280
and my real worry

1400
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,559
is we should not become complacent

1401
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,040
we this community should not casually

1402
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,720
assume that the internet will continue

1403
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,559
to exist we know there are various

1404
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,640
communities around the world

1405
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,480
working on creating a replacement for

1406
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,480
the internet and you can see all their

1407
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,240
web pages saying how great they are

1408
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,160
which incidentally run over our internet

1409
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,960
but leave that aside

1410
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,680
the people working on x25 in america

1411
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,200
online probably thought that those would

1412
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,440
continue to exist too

1413
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,319
technologies do get overtaken

1414
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:15,599
so

1415
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,040
um

1416
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,440
we've been trying at apple to raise

1417
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,720
awareness

1418
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,359
of the importance of latency not just

1419
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,480
more bandwidth

1420
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,119
and some of you may have seen

1421
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,000
the

1422
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,319
network responsiveness tester

1423
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:33,520
that's now included in mac os and ios

1424
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,000
to try to bring awareness to users that

1425
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,760
it's not just about how many megabits

1426
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,280
you have that controls your experience

1427
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,079
so

1428
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,240
we're trying to do our bit there raising

1429
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,359
awareness

1430
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,359
and what i'm looking for from this

1431
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:49,440
working group is guys

1432
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,240
as one of apple's senior engineers what

1433
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,760
should i be advocating within apple that

1434
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,440
we should do

1435
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,280
to

1436
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,599
help the internet meet future needs

1437
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,680
better and the answer is not just more

1438
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,079
bandwidth

1439
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:07,599
one of my

1440
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,440
conclusions i've come to thinking about

1441
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,720
this

1442
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,520
is

1443
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,280
i am not too concerned about worrying

1444
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,960
about backwards compatibility with

1445
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,119
classic ecn

1446
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,960
rfc 3168 was written 20 years ago

1447
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:21,839
it

1448
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,400
practically speaking isn't deployed it

1449
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,839
failed

1450
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,359
so

1451
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,920
i i get very worried when people talking

1452
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,079
about

1453
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:34,240
3168 and 4774

1454
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,119
as

1455
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:37,680
if our hands now are tied

1456
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,119
by failed ideas from 15 years ago

1457
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:43,599
i want us to fix this problem because my

1458
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,240
fear is that if we don't

1459
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,680
somebody else is going to fix it and

1460
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,640
the internet will go the way of x25

1461
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,118
that's it

1462
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,799
go ahead

1463
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,799
all right so

1464
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,720
i would uh

1465
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,920
dispute stewart's characterization as of

1466
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,760
uh

1467
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,359
rcc168 style ecn as having failed

1468
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:18,720
um

1469
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,319
i think there is actually quite a lot of

1470
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:24,240
deployment of ecn compatible nodes

1471
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,680
in the internet

1472
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,480
but not so much deployment of endpoints

1473
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,359
that actually use it

1474
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:31,660
so

1475
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,319
[Music]

1476
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,559
i think that would be the place to to

1477
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:37,839
focus

1478
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,799
um i had been planning to make a more

1479
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:43,920
detailed response to his comments

1480
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,079
jonathan can you clarify what you mean

1481
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,799
by nodes and end points

1482
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,880
okay so news

1483
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,480
uses ecm that's a billion devices

1484
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,960
we have found basically no networking

1485
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,440
equipment run by any operator ever marks

1486
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,040
the packets that's what i meant by it's

1487
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,280
a failure we've for five years we've had

1488
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,000
ecm turned on on every iphone and linux

1489
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,319
has it turned on as well and we see no

1490
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,200
ce marking in the network ever

1491
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,480
um

1492
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,280
so

1493
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,079
i was about to get to that point

1494
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:17,359
um

1495
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:20,480
i was going to to do a more detailed uh

1496
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,480
response to your comments uh by email

1497
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,880
but i want to touch on what you said

1498
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,400
about

1499
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,400
uh heuristics

1500
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,720
about when to use ecn and when to turn

1501
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,640
it off

1502
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,520
and

1503
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,440
i think that those heuristics are giving

1504
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,720
you a misleading picture here

1505
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,000
so

1506
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,760
i'll leave it at that for now and

1507
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,280
continue on the on email

1508
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,079
okay i think we have to decide

1509
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:58,799
uh jake you have a comment and then i

1510
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,480
think we have to decide whether we have

1511
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,640
time to do anything useful with l4s ops

1512
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,480
today but jake go ahead

1513
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,960
uh yeah just to

1514
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,839
respond as dirt's point i i do think

1515
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,680
there's good evidence that there are

1516
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,280
tens of millions of

1517
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,640
devices deployed uh they don't mark very

1518
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,680
frequently

1519
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,280
but the problem here is that

1520
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,440
as we get into their their deployment

1521
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,000
and their presence there causes trouble

1522
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,880
for

1523
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,160
other traffic marked or not but you know

1524
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,839
it's it's the it's the backward

1525
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,119
incompatibility uh

1526
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,760
in the signaling here

1527
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,119
i guess we've hashed this out a bunch

1528
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:42,240
but um

1529
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,319
yeah the

1530
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:45,680
uh um

1531
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,920
while we well i would not disagree with

1532
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,079
the characterization that it's failed uh

1533
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:52,079
you know it doesn't help that much and

1534
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,200
it's it's a pretty expensive location

1535
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,079
but

1536
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:57,440
um

1537
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,960
but that doesn't mean that there's no

1538
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,240
deployment and that we don't have to

1539
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,640
worry about it and

1540
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,400
this is uh

1541
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,720
yeah this is the the core of the problem

1542
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,400
to me but

1543
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,920
i guess we can discuss it more on this

1544
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,160
thanks

1545
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,760
can you do a real quick fly through the

1546
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,319
summary of l4s ops and perhaps we can

1547
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:22,400
assign some discussion time for the next

1548
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,720
session

1549
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,960
hi

1550
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,359
hi hi david um and everyone um yeah this

1551
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:34,319
this slide deck is just effectively a

1552
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:35,599
diff of

1553
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,359
um you know the edits that have been

1554
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:39,440
made in the draft since the last uh

1555
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,720
published version

1556
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,880
um so i think i can do it in a minute

1557
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,400
and then people can look offline and see

1558
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,400
if they have uh comments to take to the

1559
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,760
list so if you want to go to the next

1560
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,839
slide quest

1561
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:51,359
um

1562
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:52,559
uh yeah i won't talk about this one

1563
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,599
actually going to the next one um

1564
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:57,200
the outline um the only thing that's

1565
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,480
changed in the outline is the the

1566
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,040
title of section 6.2 non-preferred

1567
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,880
options used to be less preferred

1568
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,480
options and that's

1569
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,839
details that are

1570
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:08,720
in

1571
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:13,119
the upcoming slides on the next one

1572
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:14,480
this is the summary i sent to the

1573
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,079
mailing list um uh verbatim um so

1574
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:18,960
um

1575
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,000
and i have

1576
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,680
in this deck a slide for each one of

1577
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,040
these um that goes into a little bit

1578
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,200
more detail about what the changes were

1579
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:29,280
so that's the next eight slides then um

1580
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,200
and i think you can just at this point

1581
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,040
flip through those um

1582
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,319
uh for

1583
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:35,520
just

1584
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,839
so folks know what's in the deck um and

1585
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,520
again um

1586
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,880
we can take discussion to the list i

1587
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,839

1589

01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,079
the intention was not to try to get this

1595
