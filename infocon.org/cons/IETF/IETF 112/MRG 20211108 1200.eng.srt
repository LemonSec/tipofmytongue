the goal of the irtf

47
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,400
the iota conducts research it is not a

48
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,200
standard development organization

49
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,760
the irc focuses on longer term research

50
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,360
issues related to internet while the

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,760
parallel organizations idea focuses on

52
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,840
short-term issues of engineering and

53
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,760
standards-making

54
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
while the rtf can publish informational

55
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,680
or experimental documents in the arc

56
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,599
series its primary goal is to provide

57
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,120
development of research collaboration

58
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,200
and teamwork in exploring research

59
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,959
issues related to internet protocols

60
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,440
application architecture and technology

61
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,560
and again here you have the reference to

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,000

it's implementation of a project

104
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,520
and then we have two predictions related

105
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,639
to

106
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,000

as you know we have

118
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,680

so actually um there are

143
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,199
one the first one about a concept and

144

definition draft is our

145
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,840
revision is under preparation to take

146
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,919
into account the different command

147
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,039
and um the other one

148
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,479

also been an updated version that has

150
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,160
been proposed

the shepherd and the authors we have

177
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,639
going through a round of different

178
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,280
exchange the updates have addressed part

179
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,199
of the irtf shared comments

180
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,520
but we still have to go for with it for

181
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,759
a round of alignment for that

182
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,840
uh we hope this will be progressed soon

183
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,160
um i don't know maybe asking maybe the

184
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,360
authors i don't know olga or

185
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,240
authors of the concept definition draft

186
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,240
if they have to share anything

187
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,639
right now

188
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,479
from the classification draft we would

189
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,520
be

190
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,400
adding something standard related to the

191
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,400
relationship

192
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,919
could you repeat a bit because it was a

193
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,039
bit

194
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,000
good classification graft we are making

195
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,360
the final changes based on the comments

196
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,160
of the chair and we will be sharing the

197
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,240
version uh

198
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,280
hopefully this week

199

round of discussion uh between us so

201

that uh we can see how we address the uh

202

if i may just add something as a

212
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,958
co-author of the draft on concepts and

213
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,760
definitions we have

214
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,839
gathered also to see how to address best

215
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,240
the comments from the rtf chair so there

216
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,360
is a

217
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,880
a new update of the draft pending

218
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,600
and we we have a few proposals to

219
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,519
address the positioning with respect to

220
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,160
the research work being done on ibm and

221
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,680
to better position the draft with

222
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,720
respect to that so we hope to be able to

223
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,120
release the new version again

224
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,640
this week still

225
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,880
i hope this will be uh

226
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,480
addressing the comments from from collin

227
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,110
that's it for me

228
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,399
[Music]

229
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,399
okay we have colin on the line yeah

230
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,880

231
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,040
listener first time caller but uh i

232
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,080
won't so

233
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,760
yeah um if if

234
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,000
it's useful to have a

235
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,560
to schedule a call to talk about

236
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
these comments then i'm happy to try and

237
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,719
fit that in this week or next week

238
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,680
okay perfect thanks colin i think we

239
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,640
will uh

240
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,480
of course keep you in the loop i think

241
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,160
we have uh something to do now on more

242
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,120
on the offer size to make sure the

243
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,560
the updates are

244
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,480
satisfactory and then of course we can

245
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,440
check with you

246
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,279
perfect okay that's good

247
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,440
okay

248
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,480
just one slide i think

249
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,519
yeah so just

250
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,720
for future imaging so

251
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,640
we'll continue of course with virtual

252
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,720
meetings um

253
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,040
we try to have it monthly and we will

254
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
try to continue it monthly we were not

255
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,050
so much uh regular in the last month um

256
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,120
[Music]

257
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,640
as you may have seen i think there was a

258
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,120
summer break and then we have uh

259
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,959
of course i think we are all a bit let's

260
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,680
say environmental and by various remote

261
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,160
meetings that we have uh each on your

262
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,440
home

263
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,600
but anyway we will try to resume a bit

264
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,839
more uh the different activities we have

265
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,360
in the group uh in addition to this um

266
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,839
of course uh iatf meetings

267
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,000
um in particular we want to resume the

268
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
activity regarding let's say uh the

269
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,160
actual network and editing associates

270
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,240
license there are some propositions

271
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,320
that we have a workshop around these

272
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,440
topics

273
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,680
so i'm working on virtual meetings so we

274
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,720
try to

275
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,760
to organize it and also regarding the um

276
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,720
a research document after summers we we

277
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,560
had input during summers but we did not

278
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,040
yet consolidate and so we have to

279
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,880
also to organize dedicated meeting to

280
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,120
make it more um i'd say more

281
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,399
consolidating

282
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,480
to have something also

283
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,480
which can be reviewed and

284
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,320
more

285
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,240
integrated let's say

286
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,480
so anyway yes uh there's also the

287
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,160
mailing list of course uh different

288
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,920
tools that you haven't collaborated with

289
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,720
so do not hesitate to use it or to also

290
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,560
propose if you have any ideas or

291
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,000
topics you would like to discuss in the

292
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,720
group it's also still um is of course

293
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,240
open to

294
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,040
20 ids

295
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,600
and

296
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,480
yeah

297
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,320
that's it for me

298
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,399
if there is no question comments i think

299
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,760
we can

300
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,639
um continue

301
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,480
okay

302
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,240
any questions from the research group

303
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,639
it's not okay nothing in the chat okay

304
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,639
so let's proceed with the agenda so our

305
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,839
next

306
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,320

308
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,120

309
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,519
open it

310
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,800

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,760
update of the original draft

320
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,079
network measurement intent

321
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:28,880
and

322
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,920
i'll first briefly talk about the um the

323
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,480
updates of the draft and then i want to

324
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,639
call for some suggestions on the stage

325
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,079
of the draft

326
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,680
so next page please

327
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,519
so we can see in the diagram that

328
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,720
this time we there is not very much uh

329
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,040
many updates compared to the draft

330
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,839
presented in the last meeting and the

331
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,760
major update is the procedure we uh

332
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
the whole procedure in the in the

333
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,560
diagram at the right side of the slide

334
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,000
we can see that

335
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,320
in the original diagram in which

336
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,399
the model ni policy is a an

337
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,959
independent part of the whole procedure

338
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,360
and only communicate

339
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,760
with the translation module which we

340
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,000
think is not very reasonable and

341
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,040
accurate

342
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,320
so

343
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,880
next page please

344
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,760
um so

345
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,240
um the the left side leads

346
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,240
um the original procedure and so we we

347
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,120
think

348
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,800
we move the nmi policy model inside into

349
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,600
the

350
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,880
whole procedure where it connects the

351
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,120
nmi translation model compliance

352
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,519
assessment module and or frustration

353
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,880
model together so it is the break now

354
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,279
which we think is very reasonable now

355
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,279
because the

356
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,399
in original procedure the output of

357
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,600
translation

358
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,959
is some policies and the opposite of

359
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,079
complex assessment is the

360
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,199
result

361
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,480
and some decision whether data analysis

362
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,680
or result is is matched uh

363
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,399
with the network measurement intent and

364
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,639
the input of auto

365
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,839
whereas and the input of orchestration

366
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,959
model

367
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,560
should be

368
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,440
some

369
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,000
policies or actions according to some

370
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,959
templates so they are not very matched

371
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,600
so we moved the nmi policy model inside

372
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,880
the procedure

373
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,720
and and now

374
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,240
the outputs of translation model and

375
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,959
compliance assessment model will all be

376
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,759
translated into some policies according

377
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,880
to the templates inside the policy model

378
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,040
and these templates will

379
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,839
uh will change these uh

380
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,120
change the results to to some actions

381
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,560
where

382
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,880
which need to be inputted into the

383
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,839
orchestration model so next slide please

384
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,440
so this time

385
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,800
we

386
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,240
so this is the major update we think

387
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,079
we should modify the whole procedure and

388
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,680
we think that

389
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,680
uh

390
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,880
the uh

391
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,160
um

392
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,279
so next side please

393
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,440
i've already stated about the

394
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,199
um

395
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,920
study about the the updates in this time

396
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,800
and

397
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,040
since the uh

398
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,360
the the draft has been updated for three

399
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,920
times and we have already shown the

400
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,759
necessity in defining and satisfying the

401
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,880
network measurement intent we could know

402
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,759
how network behave through the process

403
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,240
and so we think that the draft is

404
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,959
relatively stable right now and we are

405
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,919
asking for uh the permission of chairs

406
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,079
and other participants if the threat

407
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,919
could be adopted or

408
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,039
or it if it's still in early stages

409
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,559
and if it's not so mature we wonder if

410
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,720
we could start writing the

411
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,039
on the draft that uh

412
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,079
the in intent based network use cases

413
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,240
because we think network management

414
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,880
intent is a very

415
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,400
it's a very important use case of ibn so

416
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
uh we have um

417
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,520
sent emails to chess for uh

418
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,720
several times but we haven't replied uh

419
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,480
get any reply so we wonder if

420
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,919
how to promote

421
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:48,880
uh

422
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,919
this draft so if anybody

423
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,240
is very interested in the topic and uh

424
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,760
you can send emails to us we can um

425
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,840
promote together so that's it

426
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,879
yeah thank you

427
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,240
okay

428
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,080
are there questions

429
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,159
in the audience for this trap update

430
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,840
okay i don't see anything also in the

431
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,039
chat

432
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,520
also so to address your your request for

433
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,280
research group adoption or the next step

434
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,880
of the document

435
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,400
um

436
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,679
so

437
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,679
i mean there are different things we

438
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,160
could clarify first um

439
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,520
a bit i mean we in the research group

440
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,799
uh there is no say uh official way of uh

441
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,799
adopting a research group document okay

442
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,160
it's not like in a working group where

443
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,600
you have a specific process that is

444
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,880
established

445
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,840
nevertheless in the energy uh

446
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,000
in the last couple of years we have

447
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,919
defined a

448
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,600
procedure to

449
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,080
assess the maturity of documents that

450
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,440
you would like to adopt as research

451
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,760
group document so we can point you to

452
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,799
these

453
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,520
procedures and if there are requests

454
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,000
from you to do that we can

455
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,320
start the research group call for

456
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,760
adoption

457
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,720
um

458
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,160
the things we are

459
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,400
trying to look for maturity in terms of

460
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,120
research group documents

461
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,760
are based on several aspects

462
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,240
so essentially if the work is mature

463
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,760
enough if it the scientific work that is

464
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,440
being addressed

465
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,400
is complete and what types of research

466
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,039
output are produced we're also looking i

467
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,600
mean for technical uh soundness of the

468
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,080
overall documents and also if the

469
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,919
document is in good shape

470
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,080
and the final thing we are checking is

471
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,559
if there are enough support either from

472
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,400
the authors or other participants in the

473
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
research group to actually move the work

474
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,559
forward up to a kind of completion i

475
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,640
mean what will be the

476
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,240
if we can complete

477
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,960
a

478
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,120
publication of this document in what

479
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,120
will be the form uh reading by the

480
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,159
authors

481
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,919
so that we can publish the outcome of

482
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,600
this research as part of an outcome of

483
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
the energy

484
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,960
um

485
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,120
just a comment from my side on this

486
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,280
intern based network use cases

487
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,520
i think this is good because

488
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,240
we had in our ibm workbench

489
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,559
like them to study

490
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,480
different use cases for intern-based

491
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,400
networks especially after we had the

492
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,200
initial concept and classification draft

493
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,280
being laid down with which where we

494
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,159
stand now so it's good to have this uh

495
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,320
the track measurement intent as a

496
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,240
proposed use case

497
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
what is still unclear and we have to

498
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,200
work this out as a group is whether we

499
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,240
want to have a collection of individual

500
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,720
use case drafts on different topics or

501
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,919
if we want also to have a kind of

502
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,400
a single document that takes multiple

503
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,200
use cases and tries to reflect on either

504
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,679
commonalities differences and learnings

505
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,360
across the use cases

506
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,640
we initiated that uh sometimes ago we

507
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,280
it was not clear which way we go with

508
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,840
the group i think now we have two to

509
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,320
three different use case draft that we

510
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,760
can maybe um

511
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,840
try to work together

512
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,440
and see if we want to keep them

513
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,799
independent

514
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,480
and or also to consider

515
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,480
taking part of them into a common

516
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,760
document

517
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,919
so i think it's uh we are at a nice step

518
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,679
in terms of uh

519
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,360
progressing this work

520
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,039
but it's also up to the research group

521
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,280
in fact to decide the authors and the

522
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,360
research group to decide what uh that

523
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,880
what they don't they want to do next

524
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,880
with this document and i will also the

525
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,240
floor to jerome to know if he has

526
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,120
anything to add on this

527
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,840
yeah thank you lauren um i really agree

528
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,720
with you and that that we can work

529
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,480
together with other companies in

530
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,840
promoting the internet network use cases

531
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,559
but i think that right now if there are

532
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,400
as you said there are two to three

533
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,039
different use cases listed in the

534
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,039
working group but i think

535
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,480
we um

536
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,679
we are

537
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,159
studying from different dimensions you

538
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,640
know the different uh

539
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,880
the use cases are from different

540
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,960
dimensions so i think we could um talk

541
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,520
talk with other groups to

542
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,559
to

543
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,960
study how to promote and how to work

544
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,400
together to work on the use cases

545
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,600
and

546
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,919
we will

547
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,919
exchange ideas and by email or

548
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,520
other meetings

549
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,919
so if anybody

550
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,559
are interested inside into this topic

551
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,360
you can send me emails

552
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,520
thank you

553
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,159
okay thank you um

554
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,559
so a couple of things we have a comment

555
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,480
in the chat

556
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,679
from charles

557
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,679
that mentioned that there is an existing

558
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,080
draft in mef metro intellect forum that

559
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,159
may be of interest to the offers so

560
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,720
there is a link provided to that i will

561
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,400
put that into the the notes of the

562
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,039
meeting so if authors want to refer to

563
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,200
that later on that was also possible and

564
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,960
charles if you want to make a live

565
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,120
comment don't hesitate we still have a

566
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,760
couple of minutes to help our offers

567
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,760
here the second thing i would like to

568
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,799
mention is that um

569
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,720
i think the first step for the kind of

570
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,760
uh ibn use case draft like uh network

571
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,320
measurement intent is uh would be nice

572
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,720
also maybe to connect explicitly to the

573
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,400
classification you see because we have

574
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,480
seen the path that it's useful to try to

575
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,880
position i mean we use

576
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,360
the the work learning classification and

577
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,760
if we have across different use cases uh

578
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,600
common references to the classification

579
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,440
work this could also be very useful i

580
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,480
think as an output of the group

581
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,960
okay thanks

582
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,080
josh go ahead please

583
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,600
okay um yeah so the uh

584
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,480
the draft this is charles uh echo and

585
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,559
the the draft that i mentioned

586
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,679
it uh

587
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,080
you know it's really looking at the

588
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,640
sd-wan as the use case and

589
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,320
then uh

590
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,159
from the point of view of applications

591
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,720
that are identified by the networks

592
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,200
um measuring performance of them in the

593
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,480
context of sd-wan so a bit more specific

594
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,480
perhaps than what you have here with the

595
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,000
intent-based networking but i think a

596
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,080
lot of intent based networking

597
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,760
does focus on the applications on the

598
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,840
network and so that's one way sort of of

599
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,720
look of interpreting intent or

600
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,400
capturing intent so that's why i

601
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,880
mentioned this draft may be of interest

602
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,039
um i think it it could be worth looking

603
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,760
at the era what's uh the link to the

604
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,760
draft that's uh it is a draft it hasn't

605
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,080
yet been published as a mf standard but

606
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,640
it will be relatively soon so

607
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,559
um anyways now would still be a good

608
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,640
time to have a look at that and provide

609
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,760
some feedback based on it

610
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,840
yeah thank you thank you

611
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,679
thank you charles useful always to have

612
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,360
a different perspective i think authors

613
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,600
will consider that in the discussion or

614
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,159
revisions thank you and just to mention

615
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,880
also uh robert robert wilson also

616
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,360
mentioned a useful reference that could

617
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,840
be added to the document which is on the

618
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,240
network telemetry framework from ops

619
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,000
area working group

620
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,159
so it's already part of the notes offers

621
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,440
you can also have a look into the

622
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,960
minutes after that if you want to have

623
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,039
the pointers mentioned by charles and

624
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,360
robert

625
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,279
okay so

626
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,559
jerome if you're okay with that and we

627
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,640
have no more

628
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,679
questions from the room we can

629
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,679
move on

630
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,640
i don't have any other comments

631
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,039
okay so just uh because we still get

632
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,520
some inputs on the chat so i invite

633
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,200
authors to look at the chat but we also

634
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,960
mention something and everything will be

635
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,600
posted anyway in the minutes and now we

636
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
switch to the other presentation thank

637
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,840
you

638
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,120
okay so next presentation is about the

639
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,840
interconnection

640
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,720
intense it will be planted by lewis

641
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,960
yes thank you jerome and lauren

642
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,320
i

643
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,860
think that the slides have been

644
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,960
[Music]

645
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,640
uploaded

646
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,080
i cannot see them yet

647
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,440
okay

648
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,039
you can see it

649
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,559
okay thank you very much

650
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,600
so uh yeah i will present this update on

651
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,760
the interconnection intense draft with

652
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,440
essentially try to explore the

653
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,520
applicability of the intents for for

654
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,919
interconnection in in a in a white sense

655
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,080
in a wider sense so next please

656
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,760
so regarding the draft status there was

657
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,080
a first version presented already in itf

658
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,840
108 in july the last year

659
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,919
this version presents an update i will

660
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,159
comment on on some of the points later

661
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,039
on and also just to highlight the fact

662
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,279
that paolo lucente is also

663
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,600
added as author of the of the draft

664
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,399
we

665
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,840
power on myself we have already

666
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,840
identified new content that is expected

667
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,640
to be included as a new version for itf

668
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,399
113

669
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,399
and today essentially we will comment on

670
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,480
what is present now in the in the draft

671
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,039
so next please

672
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,480
okay regarding the motivation and the

673
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,640
objectives of

674
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,679
of this work so essentially what we are

675
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,760
perceiving or what we are seeing

676
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,520
is that the present mode of operation of

677
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,080
in the interconnection world

678
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,919
essentially a

679
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,240
this interconnection is only conceived

680
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,200
as a pure interchange of ip traffic so

681
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,559
no more than that

682
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,880
these environments of interconnection

683
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,200
and for peering and transit essentially

684
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,399
require

685
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,320
long interactions between parties is

686
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,200
typically static in the fact that you

687
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,799
establish a session and

688
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,880
essentially maintain that session along

689
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,559
the lifetime of the of the agreement for

690
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,200
interchange uh ip traffic

691
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,640
and uh well is somehow based on a manual

692
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,000
uh operation at all so the the situation

693
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,840
is changing in in the fact that the

694
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,480
operators are now starting to deploy

695
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,159
computing capabilities and this is

696
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,559
coming with the advent of a cloud and

697
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,520
edge computing and also with the event

698
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,799
of a virtualization so a existing model

699
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,880
for interconnection is limited to that

700
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,640
interchange of ip traffic so we were

701
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,840
wondering how to leverage on intents for

702
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,279
um

703
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,640
for evolving such a way of

704
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,039
interconnecting and taking into account

705
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,840
those other capabilities that allow two

706
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,679
requests for more advanced services and

707
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,919
here we are considering services like

708
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,320
the ones that could permit

709
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,360
different stakeholders to deploy a

710
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,799
virtualized services for instance in

711
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,039
different domains or to leverage in

712
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,600
compute capabilities of any other domain

713
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,240
in order to instantiate later on and

714
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,080
whatever builder network function or

715
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,000
container or so no and clearly here

716
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,760
an example of that could be to

717
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,440
instantiate a service function chain in

718
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,559
a multi-domain environment so how we are

719
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,640
trying to address and to explore such

720
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,640
kind of scenarios leveraging on these

721
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,120
novel capabilities that exceed just the

722
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,000
pure interchange of ip traffic so next

723
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
please

724
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,000
so regarding the the summary of the

725
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,840
draft contents so

726
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,159
again the target is to leverage on the

727
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,320
and intent

728
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,559
mechanisms in order to enrich the

729
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,960
interconnection request so going further

730
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,520
of that pure traffic interchange and the

731
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,919
scenarios of applicability uh

732
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,320
we mentioned before the one of the

733
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,679
the typical one let's say between

734
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,480
operators but also is uh clear probably

735
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,640
important to highlight the situation or

736
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,799
that this is also being fostered by the

737
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,760
advent of ie networks where the

738
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,200
there is this uh

739
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,600
um idea of interconnecting private

740
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
networks to public networks and so on so

741
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,080
far so it's not just i mean moving from

742
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,039
pure appearing and transit to something

743
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,159
else uh

744
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,840
involving further capabilities the

745
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,159
compute edge and so but also the

746
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,399
different actors that are not

747
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,159
let's say in nate

748
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,200
that probably today are not so much

749
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,120
present in in the in the real

750
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,559
deployments

751
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,240
clearly multi-domain network as a

752
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,919
service request or multi-domain network

753
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,840
virtualization would be also target of

754
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,080
of this kind of

755
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,240
interconnection intents regarding the

756
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,559
modes of usage of these interconnection

757
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,480
intents we would have the baseline one

758
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,840
that would be the ip traffic

759
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,159
interconnection so clean transit but

760
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,840
also we

761
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,559
we air force we are foreseen

762
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,919
other scenarios like could be for

763
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,360
instance express

764
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,240
service intents like could

765
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,000
could be the ones for instance for the

766
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,279
cdn interconnection that is work also in

767
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,360
itfc dna working group or in the

768
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,399
streaming video alliance

769
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,519
other

770
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,279
usages like a virtual network function

771
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,760
as a service so and here and i can an

772
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,360
example could be for instance the

773
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,279
deployment of packet wall capabilities

774
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,840
for uh virtual network operators and

775
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,279
maybe here we are

776
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,679
just suggesting for what

777
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,600
other tools in in idea could be used

778
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,000
maybe this service function our topology

779
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,640
model could be used for that

780
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,320
also to um a use these intents for

781
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,519
interconnecting

782
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,679
computing capabilities for instance

783
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,440
hitting functions or containers on top

784
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,000
of them and maybe leveraging also in

785
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,840
some other drafts that have been

786
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,159
presented in in other working groups in

787
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,159
atf or any combination of the all these

788
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,279
usages

789
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,279
i have mentioned before so essentially

790
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,159
to make

791
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,279
and

792
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,480
broader scope of different

793
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,799
interconnections that are now or are

794
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,480
expected to be allowed now with these

795
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,360
new capabilities in in operator site so

796
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,200
the benefits of of this intent would be

797
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,120
to establish a common and a normalized

798
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,519
way between service providers but also

799
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,200
private networks in order to automate

800
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,519
the interconnection and look for a

801
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,519
simple way of expressing and reaching

802
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,440
their connection request

803
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,559
again

804
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,120
going further than the pure iep traffic

805
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,399
exchange

806
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,279
so next please

807
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,240
so as next steps we will work developing

808
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,679
in this intern based capabilities for

809
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,960
interconnection aspects trying to

810
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,360
explore more details on on that and

811
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,919
um some for the details not present here

812
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,760
in the slides like

813
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,360
the policies or maybe also extend to

814
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,880
different kind of technologies optics

815
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,919
and so

816
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,039
also to request comments and inputs for

817
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,799
from the audience from the research

818
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,720
group audience in order to enrich the

819
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,320
the document for sure

820
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,880
and again also we would like to position

821
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,799
this draft as one of the potential

822
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,799
intent use cases that are being

823
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,360
developed in this research group uh

824
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,519
and well here probably the same comment

825
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,399
as

826
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,519
as before

827
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,440
and the presentation before so that's

828
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,200
all from my side thank you so much and

829
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,360
for sure i'm glad to answer whatever

830
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,360
question

831
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,559
thank you always uh do we have questions

832
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,918
from the audience on this chat

833
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,000
okay i have one question

834
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,880
just coming back to one of the slides

835
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,799
when you're mentioning different i mean

836
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,120
enrich interconnection requests between

837
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,720
different actors

838
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,200
uh do you do you see the main i will say

839
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,600
segments like being into inter carrier

840
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,839
exchange or uh it's more like between

841
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,079
between different operators at any point

842
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,520
or between different actors like

843
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,800
vertical

844
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,159
uh type of factors and operators i mean

845
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,239
for this interconnection what kind of

846
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,879
environment do you see

847
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,639
the the initial

848
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,159
the starting idea let's say come from

849
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:26,879
the

850
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,839
interoperator interconnection but

851
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,560
we we think that can be extended to any

852
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,800
other scenarios as soon as we could

853
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,639
abstract let's say the way of requesting

854
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,760
this intent

855
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,320
this capability sorry so probably could

856
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,560
be applicable for all of them although

857
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,239
at least this is my

858
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,359
my deal

859
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,639
but the starting point was for sure

860
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,240
interoperator interconnection yes

861
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,440
okay thank you

862
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,839
i will put in the minutes but

863
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,159
i come

864
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,920
it was a recent publication i don't

865
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,920
remember if it was a cnsm or another

866
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,280
conference that

867
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,560
was uh

868
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,880
addressing uh inter carry exchange

869
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,240
automation and i think they were

870
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,400
referring to some kind of uh level of

871
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,960
abstraction so this may be a reference a

872
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,680
useful reference for this um

873
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,799
for sure thank you so much

874
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,480
anything else

875
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,240
no other questions nothing in the chat

876
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,560
so thank you luis we proceed with the

877
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,960
agenda and uh hopefully let's see if we

878
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,040
can also come up with something

879
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,640
in common for these different use case

880
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,640
tracks around the ibm

881
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,960
thank you

882
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,799
thank you

883
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,720
so next presentation is the digital

884
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,359
twins for industrial networking

885
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,000
and gracely

886
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,880
can you hear me now

887
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,839
i'm talking from the office of franco

888
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,000
caligati so

889
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,040
i'm using his computer

890
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,359
okay

891
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,079
okay

892
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,920
uh so um

893
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,079
good morning to everyone i'm cara

894
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,800
graceli a phd student at the university

895
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,240
of bologna

896
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,560
during this session i'm going to show

897
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,320
you and present the

898
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,320
activity me and my colleagues have

899
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,560
carried out

900
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,880
on digital twins for industrial iot

901
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,520
networking

902
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,279
next please

903
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,839
this activity is actually part of a

904
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,240
project called forest

905
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,640
that started two years ago and now is

906
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,040
almost at the end

907
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,200
this is a project funded by our regional

908
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,640
government

909
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,440
and the focus is cyber security on

910
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,280
industrial and manufacturing

911
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,960
environments

912
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,320
so some of the objectives of the project

913
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,160
were the

914
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,520
identification of possible weaknesses

915
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,359
and assessment of cyber risk level

916
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,160
in connected production plans where for

917
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,880
example iot technologies are applied

918
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,560
used

919
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,760
and

920
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,200
more

921
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,760
another goal was the

922
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,000
identification and the implementation of

923
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,839
solution of course to improve the cyber

924
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,079
security level

925
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,520
in our particular case actually

926
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,560
our group focus on the emulation the

927
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,520
creation of a system able to emulate the

928
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,119
real

929
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,160
network

930
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,400
architectures

931
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,240
for

932
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,960
to perform some cyber security testing

933
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,040
for example technol

934
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,359
technological validations

935
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,760
and triangle in general

936
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,400
next please

937
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,280
so

938
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,599
in our activity

939
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,599
we combine

940
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,400
two principles the one one

941
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,800
of the cyber range a saber range is an

942
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,160
environment

943
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,880
for cyber security training technology

944
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,960
validation and testing

945
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,760
and the idea of a digital twin

946
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,880
a digital twin in our

947
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,400
in our case is a virtual replica of the

948
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,560
real system so the real network

949
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,640
architecture manufacturing and

950
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,200
industrial network architecture

951
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,440
and due to the constraints of the

952
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,640
project

953
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,680
and the context of this activity we

954
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,480
actually wanted the digital twin

955
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,119
completely separated from the

956
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,720
real the real twin because we couldn't

957
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,200
interfere of course with the real

958
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,640
productive lines and plants so

959
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,880
so what we have implemented is a digital

960
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,839
twin

961
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,640
that we use for uh

962
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,200
as a cyber range environment for testing

963
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,760
for example we carried out some

964
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,440
simulation of attacks and so on

965
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,079
next please

966
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,200
in this work we have exploited our

967
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,520
expertise

968
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,839
on virtualization technologies and

969
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,720
paradigms such as nfv network function

970
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,560
virtualization and software-defined

971
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,920
networking

972
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,880
and in particular

973
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,400
we followed the

974
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,480
etsy management and orchestration

975
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,040
functionalities and framework

976
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,680
uh the etsy framework covers the for

977
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,079
example allows us to design

978
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,440
uh

979
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,160
the architecture we tag level

980
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,720
description of the architecture

981
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,680
and then to describe each building block

982
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,760
each element we want in our digital twin

983
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,880
and the topology so how we

984
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,280
combine all the building blocks together

985
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,280
we can interconnect them

986
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,560
with templates called descriptors

987
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,800
we will i will show you later

988
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,200
in the next slides

989
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,160
the types of descriptors

990
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,839
and finally

991
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,680
the etsy management and orchestration

992
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,599
allows also to have an automated

993
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,119
deployment so

994
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,480
with these

995
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,319
we could have

996
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,240
an automated deployment

997
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,240
and configuration of all the components

998
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,000
of the digital twin

999
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,960
uh next please

1000
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,599
this is uh in this slide you can see a

1001
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,920
picture of the reference architecture

1002
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,000
this is a general figure

1003
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,160
we consider some of these elements for

1004
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,279
the actual deployment

1005
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,280
you can see that we can have one or more

1006
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,599
production plants with iot uh

1007
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,160
connectivity one or more gateways it

1008
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,599
depends on the

1009
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,200
protocols

1010
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,599
we are using in the

1011
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,359
in this environment

1012
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,839
and then we have other elements that are

1013
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,880
not related to the real production the

1014
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,880
to the production plans but are more

1015
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,960
operative and and

1016
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,119
for the enterprise part of the network

1017
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,640
so we have uh

1018
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,319
we can have vpn servers we can nodes

1019
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,440
firewall

1020
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,359
uh an intrusion detection system or

1021
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,119
production system

1022
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,640
uh big data analytics and so on

1023
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,960
and in our case all of these components

1024
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,079
are to be replicated into

1025
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,520
a virtualized

1026
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,359
replicas

1027
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,599
with virtual machines or containers both

1028
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,160
approaches are possible we selected the

1029
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,800
day one based on virtual machine

1030
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,280
and we exploited the network function

1031
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,920
virtualization to emulate the network

1032
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,319
architectures all the functions that are

1033
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,319
called virtualized network functions in

1034
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,800
the term of nfv

1035
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,240
and the

1036
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,760
application into wheelchair replicas too

1037
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,400
next please

1038
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,599
so

1039
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,319
since we use the uh nfb management and

1040
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,000
orchestration framework actually uh the

1041
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,560
digital twin life cycle is uh

1042
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,359
quite similar to the one of uh and after

1043
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,800
slice

1044
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,319
um we we have different phases of the

1045
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,680
life cycle

1046
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,720
uh

1047
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,000
one is a pre-phase is not actually a

1048
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,119
part real part of the life cycle is the

1049
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,720
preparation phase

1050
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,280
uh during which we can design

1051
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,040
the architecture we must design the

1052
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,599
architecture of the digital twin with

1053
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,359
descriptors

1054
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,280
once the descriptors are created we

1055
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,440
onboard them on the orchestration

1056
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,640
platform

1057
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,560
and here we can have also some

1058
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,200
additional network environment setup for

1059
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,640
example we needed additional networks to

1060
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,960
have access to the external world for

1061
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,960
example and manage for management

1062
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,800
functionalities

1063
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,280
then we have the commissioning phase

1064
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,920
where the digital twin instance is

1065
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,119
created

1066
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,160
so all the components are all deployed

1067
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,680
automatically

1068
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,520
and

1069
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,280
then we have the operation phase when

1070
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,680
when all the components are up running

1071
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,880
we can

1072
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,839
monitor and reconfigure them

1073
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,119
as needed

1074
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,079
and finally once when the digital twin

1075
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,400
is no more needed we can eliminate all

1076
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,160
the components

1077
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,319
and so we have the decommissioning phase

1078
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,920
where all the resources also are

1079
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,520
released

1080
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,079
next please

1081
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,760
here you can see the software we are

1082
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,640
using and that we have chosen for the

1083
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,079
this project

1084
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,880
uh open source mono that is the

1085
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,200
management and orchestration platform

1086
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,040
nfv management and orchestration

1087
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,839
platform promoted by

1088
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:08,480
etsy

1089
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,280
and that is this is the orchestrator

1090
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,040
with some other management

1091
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,720
functionalities

1092
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,440
of the lifecycle we have just seen

1093
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,079
and then osm is integrated with

1094
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:21,440
openstack

1095
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,440
openstack is the infrastructure as a

1096
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,000
service platform that we use to have

1097
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
computer networking and storage

1098
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,440
resources

1099
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,240
and in terms of the nfv framework is

1100
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,520
also

1101
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,000
the virtualized infrastructure manager

1102
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,880
that manages the allocation of

1103
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,119
resources as needed and specified in the

1104
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,960
descriptor

1105
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,520
next split

1106
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,599
here you can see

1107
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,280
the picture that

1108
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,000
sum up so some of the concepts i

1109
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,640
i've talked about in the in the previous

1110
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,000
slides

1111
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,960
um we started deployment from eye level

1112
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,720
descriptors so

1113
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,640
you can see two types of descriptors

1114
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,800
here uh the vienna descriptions are the

1115
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,520
one for each building block that

1116
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,480
this type of descriptor tells how uh

1117
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,400
which are what are the characteristics

1118
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,359
of each bnf so each

1119
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,079
element of the digital twin and then we

1120
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,640
have an upper level type of descriptor

1121
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,680
that are the network service descriptors

1122
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,200
that

1123
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,839
describe the topology how we want to

1124
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,800
combine all the vnfs so we want to

1125
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,960
combine all the elements in our digital

1126
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,160
twin

1127
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,560
and then we need also to upload for

1128
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,800
example in our case we had we have a

1129
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,440
deployment with with virtual machines so

1130
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,720
we need to upload the cloud images we we

1131
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,720
want to use

1132
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,640
then we have the orchestrator that can

1133
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,720
talk with the

1134
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,480
infrastructure as a service platform

1135
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,920
with openstack

1136
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,000
and the management functionalities are

1137
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,280
actually shared by both platforms we

1138
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,359
have some functionalities in in the

1139
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,520
orchestrator you know sm and some may

1140
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,800
not stack

1141
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,359
next please

1142
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,280
here you can see a list of the

1143
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,280
components that we consider for our

1144
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,640
deployment

1145
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,640
um as we enable

1146
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,040
sorry we have the pro okay just be

1147
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,000
enough

1148
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,119
um

1149
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,079
we can have a big packet inspector uh

1150
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,240
intrusion prevention system or detection

1151
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,560
system firewall traffic shaper vpn

1152
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,359
server some of them were already in the

1153
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,280
reference architecture

1154
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,200
and as virtual application we can have

1155
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,440
different type of also protocols

1156
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,119
application with using different

1157
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,839
protocols of the traditional industrial

1158
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:52,720
protocols like canopen mqtt

1159
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,359
modbus and lora

1160
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,839
next please

1161
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,520
finally here you can see

1162
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,960
the actual deployment deployment of our

1163
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,119
digital twin the current deployment

1164
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,040
we implemented the elements that you see

1165
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,040
outlining in dashed lines in this figure

1166
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,960
we have

1167
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,640
as i told you before

1168
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,240
we needed some two networks for um to be

1169
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,160
present before the instantiation of the

1170
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,880
digital twin these are the blue one for

1171
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,720
the external connectivity and the green

1172
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,240
one for the

1173
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,880
management functionalities

1174
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,640
with the instance we create also a

1175
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,920
management console for this purpose

1176
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,240
and then we have a firewall

1177
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,400
the other one are all bnfs we have a

1178
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,839
firewall

1179
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,240
an intrusion detection system based on

1180
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,079
suricata

1181
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,079
and an internal router plus for the

1182
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,800
more related industrial part we have

1183
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,599
a

1184
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,920
virtual machine with that modbus traffic

1185
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,200
generator

1186
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,079
for uh to simulate the

1187
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,559
possible possible cyber attacks and so

1188
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,319
on we used

1189
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,440
a kali linux machine you can see

1190
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,240
also this one in the figure

1191
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,959
next please

1192
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,559
uh here we have just only a slide

1193
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,359
that makes a reference to the one of the

1194
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,119
model usually used to layer the

1195
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,200
infrastructure in the industrial and

1196
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,200
manufacturing environment it is only to

1197
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,079
say that we we have a partner related to

1198
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:34,960
the

1199
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,040
field and production plans

1200
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,599
uh the one for operation and the other

1201
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,079
one for enterprise which actually are in

1202
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,319
our deployment are overlapped

1203
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,880
next please

1204
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,720
now

1205
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,640
i'd like to show you a short video demo

1206
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,280
of the deployment and an example of a

1207
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,280
possible attack

1208
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,960
we tested on the

1209
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,839
maybe if i can share the video myself

1210
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,400
it's better because so i can

1211
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,440
stop when i want to comment and so on

1212
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,760
okay so you have to redress your videos

1213
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,000
with sharing

1214
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,480
okay

1215
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,119
okay

1216
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,680
so the first part of the video is about

1217
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,319
the orchestration and the instantiation

1218
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,359
of the digital twin

1219
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,760
okay here we have the graphical

1220
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,520
interface of osm

1221
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,760
we need of course an account

1222
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,640
and uh first of all we need to

1223
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,160
um

1224
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,280
i just i will stop for a moment with the

1225
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,440
video uh we need

1226
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,599
to define the logical connectivity

1227
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,800
between the uh western platform and open

1228
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,640
stack platform

1229
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,319
so

1230
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,079
this can be done with

1231
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,839
the beam accounts the so-called beam

1232
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,079
account so basically we only specify the

1233
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,160
type of the beam

1234
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,440
the tenants for example the password and

1235
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,200
the user we want to use and in

1236
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,720
particular how to reach the beam

1237
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,480
this is needed for of course the

1238
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,480
deployment later

1239
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,800
here you can see the part related to the

1240
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,000
description

1241
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
we can create the descriptors

1242
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,760
the main descriptors are already

1243
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,240
imported in the video in the usm

1244
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,119
catalogs you can see are the bnf

1245
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,839
which correspond to each elements of the

1246
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,480
digital twin we have firewall

1247
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,000
gateway ids and so on

1248
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,839
this is the list

1249
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,920
and here you have an example of one of

1250
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,920
them

1251
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,800
in the descriptor we define the id that

1252
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,079
is used to reference the descriptor

1253
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,720
then we have the most important part is

1254
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,720
the video the deployment unit which

1255
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,800
specified the for example the cloud

1256
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,440
image we want to use for the vm

1257
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,280
additional configuration files

1258
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,119
the interfaces we want to create

1259
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,200
for the machine

1260
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,480
and finally the flavor the resources we

1261
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,040
want to allocate to the machine

1262
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,800
here you can see on the contrary the

1263
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,720
other type of descriptor we have network

1264
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,040
service packages

1265
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,480
the descriptor are inside the package

1266
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,480
in the network service we put together

1267
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,040
the components we want in the

1268
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,960
uh in the final deployment so we have

1269
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,200
the list of debian apps

1270
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,160
and the we define the uh virtual

1271
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,599
networks link

1272
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,839
the descriptor with the link descriptor

1273
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:21,520
that are that corresponds to the network

1274
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,880
that interconnect the bnf so

1275
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,800
this is an example

1276
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,880
and we can define of course also for

1277
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,520
example ip addresses if needed

1278
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,400
or other parameters

1279
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,200
once the descriptor are ready we need to

1280
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,359
upload them on the orchestration

1281
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,520
platform in the catalog

1282
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,359
this is an example with other

1283
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,559
descriptors that were not present before

1284
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:47,839
in the catalog

1285
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:51,759
this is a simple drag and drop procedure

1286
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,079
and finally

1287
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,880
we can launch the instance now that we

1288
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,040
have the descriptors so

1289
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,800
um we need to define

1290
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,000
we need to select the um descriptor we

1291
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,200
want to create uh to deploy

1292
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,559
uh we define a name a description and

1293
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,480
most importantly we need to select a

1294
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,520
beam for the deployment

1295
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,800
and

1296
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,680
so

1297
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,920
here you can see what is going on

1298
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,640
stack during the deployment

1299
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,440
the blocks are the vms

1300
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,520
they are pop up in during the

1301
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,839
instantiation and

1302
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,000
then we have the vertical bars that are

1303
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,960
the virtual d networks some of them are

1304
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,280
actual networks and the other one beer

1305
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,920
12 inside the openstack platform and

1306
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,800
here

1307
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,880
where the list of all running components

1308
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,559
this is an example

1309
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,359
finally of the a possible attack on the

1310
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:52,880
modbus

1311
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,319
using the modbus protocol

1312
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,760
this is we have the kalima linux machine

1313
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,040
and the node with the traffic generator

1314
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,640
the modbus traffic generator

1315
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,359
here we are performing a massive reading

1316
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,000
of the modbus registers for example from

1317
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,240
the kali machine to the other node

1318
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,680
and

1319
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,800
this is our an example how

1320
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,599
we can configure the ids the intrusion

1321
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,559
detection system to detect this type of

1322
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,319
behavior so

1323
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:31,920
on the right

1324
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,839
you can see uh in the right part you can

1325
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,559
see the terminal with the

1326
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,720
output from the intrusion detection

1327
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,118
system

1328
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:44,640
and this is older

1329
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,799
so thanks for your attention

1330
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,480
and if you have question of course i'm

1331
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,480
here

1332
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:03,839
thank you thank you cara for the

1333
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:05,920
presentation so any questions or

1334
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,040
comments

1335
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,359
from the audience

1336
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,920
okay so looks looks not um

1337
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,839
thank you again kiara for the

1338
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,280
presentation

1339
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,640
and

1340
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,040
um neither is more comment than mailing

1341
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,240
this referral to you

1342
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,119
uh actually i i do have a question

1343
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,160
um because if you unless correctly you

1344
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,680
have set up uh

1345
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,000
different virtual environments

1346
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,720
um but how do you relate that to um

1347
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,720
the aspect of a digital tweet and having

1348
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,880
the opportunity to

1349
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,559
see link between what's actually

1350
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,200
happening on the for instance the uh

1351
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,040
the digital plant

1352
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,000
the factory and um

1353
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,440
i mean what you monitor from this

1354
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,880
environment and how you can run for

1355
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,920
instance simulation in the digital tween

1356
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,960
and retract on the on the actual uh

1357
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,880
environment can you give us a bit of

1358
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,319
your feedback on

1359
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:25,280
this interplay between the real

1360
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,359
network environment or the real iot

1361
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:28,640
environment

1362
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,760
and um the digital twitter tweet

1363
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,839
yeah so um the question is about how we

1364
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,160
can actually interface to the real

1365
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,559
network right

1366
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,720
this is actually the focus of some of

1367
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,640
the other research groups and the other

1368
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,640
partners of the project

1369
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,599
uh some of them um

1370
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,079
provided some software to interface for

1371
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:53,680
example with the

1372
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,920
actual production plans and industrial

1373
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,359
networks

1374
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,440
with can open

1375
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,040
for example android one technologies

1376
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,599
and we once at the inner previous

1377
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,400
deployment not the one in the video we

1378
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,599
actually

1379
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,720
included this part are also in our

1380
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,079
digital twin

1381
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,319
uh in particular the one related to can

1382
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:19,359
open there is also uh in the

1383
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,520
i think in one of the figure i've shown

1384
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,680
you

1385
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:25,839
in the figure you can see also a node

1386
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:28,640
with the can open protocol

1387
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,520
and

1388
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,799
then actually we don't have also a

1389
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,799
real-time monitoring because due to the

1390
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:37,200
constraints we didn't want we wanted

1391
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,440
something completely separated from the

1392
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,200
real twin i

1393
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,440
yeah

1394
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,280
here you can see also i can open

1395
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,880
i don't know if this

1396
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:03,839
you have the for instance showed in the

1397
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,240
demo video like an introduction

1398
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,319
intrinsic detection

1399
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:11,200
system that runs into the virtual

1400
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,240
twin

1401
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,720
do you have other typical

1402
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,640
scenarios or

1403
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,480
types of functionality that you you

1404
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,200
simulate into your digital twin or

1405
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,960
is it working progress just a little bit

1406
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,119
the breadth the number of uh it's a

1407
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:26,880
functionality you are able to simulate

1408
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,319
or what kind of functionality you

1409
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,400
simulate

1410
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,520
for this kind of environment

1411
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,240
we actually had some industrial partners

1412
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,680
in the project

1413
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,040
and we are getting now feedbacks from

1414
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,839
them so we are waiting for them in order

1415
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,640
to maybe try different uh

1416
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,720
types of attacks and scenarios it

1417
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,119
depends on what they are interesting

1418
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,280
actually so we are waiting for them and

1419
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,200
we are working uh

1420
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,440
now on this part because this is the

1421
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,760
last part of the project so

1422
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,280
we are waiting for feedbacks

1423
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,160
in order to proceed with the other

1424
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,720
testing

1425
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,880
thank you thank you thank you thank you

1426
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,280
thank you

1427
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,480
yes chinese

1428
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,720
yes we can hear you

1429
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,960
okay uh here's the question uh

1430
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,799
uh can i

1431
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:36,400
can i know whether you have a

1432
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,200
wrong performance test on your solution

1433
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,440
i wonder whether

1434
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,920
this motion can can support a

1435
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,359
large-scale

1436
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:46,400
network

1437
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,280
simulation or digital twin solution

1438
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,520
so it's a in the resource cost

1439
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,040
affordable

1440
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,520
thank you

1441
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,040
you can hear me right uh this depends

1442
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,319
actually on the available hardware and

1443
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,079
resources on

1444
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:10,480
the cloud platform i would say yes

1445
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,400
for this testing of course we use uh

1446
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,200
some

1447
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,359
not so powerful are there actually the

1448
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:19,680
one we had they are in the lab

1449
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,760
at the university but in principle if

1450
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,319
you have more resources you can

1451
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:26,400
have a larger scale deployment for

1452
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,400
example

1453
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:47,119
okay thank you i think we have no more

1454
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:48,559
questions on this

1455
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,640
presentation thank you a lot

1456
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,040
for having the slide and the video and

1457
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,960
good luck for the rest of the project

1458
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,559
and anyway if you have follow-ups we

1459
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,119
will be glad to hear more from

1460
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:00,480
the research output that you are

1461
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,599
progressing on thank you

1462
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,839
so let's move to the next presentation

1463
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:11,319
in your agenda

1464
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:35,680
yes we can hear you

1465
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,640
okay

1466
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,119
uh hello everyone this is

1467
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:43,119
from china mobile my printation is a and

1468
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,599
efficient data collection medicine for

1469
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,440
digital network

1470
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,960
uh a related draft can be found on the

1471
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,640
website

1472
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,440
next please

1473
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,359
okay and this draft consists of several

1474
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:03,440
sections including introduction of your

1475
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,280
conclusion and advantages as well

1476
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,079
next please

1477
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,559
in this slide i will present and

1478
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:19,920
present the background and introduction

1479
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,680
a digital network is defined

1480
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,960
as a network system with a physical

1481
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,119
network at two network

1482
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,839
which can be mapped interactively in

1483
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:33,280
real time

1484
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,400
so the

1485
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,440
construction digital network requires

1486
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,280
real-time

1487
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,559
data of

1488
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,280
a physical network to update the state

1489
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,520
or twin network

1490
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,799
in facial large network work skill

1491
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:52,400
net collection storage and management

1492
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,280
fixed with grid countries

1493
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,920
however the existing

1494
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,119
method

1495
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:01,680
collects the full amount of data from

1496
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,839
the physical network

1497
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,799
for monthly and it does consider the

1498
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:09,039
problems such as

1499
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:10,480
timeline

1500
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,119
efficient storage resource

1501
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:15,520
log computational

1502
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,480
efficiency

1503
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,720
at a restaurant

1504
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,760
bad waste resource caused by

1505
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,440
data transmission

1506
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,160
therefore it is important to

1507
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,960
propose a lightweight at the efficient

1508
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,440
data cluster

1509
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,799
aggregation and correlation method

1510
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:37,599
next please

1511
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,160
in order to solve those problems

1512
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,920
this draft introduced and uh efficient

1513
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,799
and lightweight data collection uh

1514
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:51,440
aggregation and correlation method

1515
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,280
uh three network sense inscri uh is

1516
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,720
instruction to a physical network to

1517
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:03,839
collect data or demand and then

1518
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,920
the physical network

1519
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,079
complexity structure

1520
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:09,359
such as

1521
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:12,160
laundry representation a time machine

1522
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,160
streaming element of

1523
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,240
physical network

1524
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,720
complex data

1525
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,359
aggregation and correlation

1526
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,480
finally a time major streaming element

1527
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,640
sends the

1528
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,839
processed or representing the data to

1529
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:32,240
the twin network

1530
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,038
next please

1531
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,319
next i will introduce the details

1532
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,000
of draft

1533
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,359
the main modules involved

1534
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,720
are showing figure uh the digital

1535
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,400
network consists

1536
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,599
of physical network at twin network

1537
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:58,480
the physical network includes the

1538
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,520
multiple data storage sentence a

1539
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,839

01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,360
next please

1700
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,960
uh okay this

1701
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,480
draft has the following advantages

1702
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,560
firstly the

1703
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,440
need for storage resource in the twin

1704
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,880
network is

1705
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,320
reduced

1706
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:28,400
then the need for computing resource and

1707
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,040
improve the efficiency of data

1708
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,159

1709
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:37,559
is reduced

1710
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,719
next

1711
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:42,560
and the bandwidth resource consumed

1712
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,840
by the data transmission is

1713
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,760
greatly reduced

1714
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,800
finally data transmission let's say it

1715
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,360
reduced

1716
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,040
next please

1717
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,320
finally

1718
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:05,840
i will analyze the

1719
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,760
instruction carrying

1720
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,120
information

1721
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,880
and discover

1722
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,080
more

1723
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:15,920
concrete examples of data collection and

1724
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,199
exceed about the exterior

1725
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:23,559
okay thank you any questions

1726
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,719
thank you for the for the presentation

1727
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:38,719
um is there any comments or questions

1728
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,880
i have a question but i like to hear

1729
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,480
from the floor first

1730
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,450
i have also one

1731
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:45,280
[Music]

1732
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,360
okay um

1733
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,120
so thanks for for this work it's

1734
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,520
interesting their direction um

1735
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,000
in fact my question is is also a comment

1736
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,280
um

1737
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,360
i think it's an important question in

1738
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,400
digital twin environment to consider see

1739
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,000
the performance

1740
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,360
trade-off to get accurate data

1741
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,440
about the real environment

1742
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,679
and to balance that with the cost of

1743
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,920
collecting this data okay so the

1744
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,440
fidelity from the need so

1745
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,760
two things first i think it's

1746
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,679
we need to be careful because the notion

1747
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:21,920
of digital twin i insist on the twin is

1748
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,000
that we need to have a very accurate

1749
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,760
representation of

1750
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,320
the real environment so it's not

1751
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,320
approximate it's not

1752
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,239
we really need to be very close to the

1753
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:33,120
real

1754
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,840
because the idea is to be able to

1755
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:38,320
replicate and simulate so that we really

1756
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,159
see how the real one will behave and be

1757
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:41,760
able to use that

1758
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,560
to make useful simulation and

1759
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:47,920
scenarios uh to be able to help or to

1760
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,000
support the real environment so i think

1761
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,080
there is this question of how far we can

1762
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,640
get into saving on the data collection

1763
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,880
and data representation without

1764
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,199
compromising this twin

1765
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,280
approach so this is more common the

1766
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,600
second thing and it's a bit my question

1767
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,360
related to the research that we can do

1768
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,040
in this in this work because i think you

1769
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,960
touch a lot about the methods to collect

1770
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,159
data to aggregate data and

1771
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:14,239
to convey data between the

1772
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:16,000
the real environment and the tree so i

1773
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,280
think this is very relevant as a

1774
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,360
mechanism but i was thinking about more

1775
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,440
the the let's say the algorithm or the

1776
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,400
methods in fact to

1777
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,360
to understand what kind of data we need

1778
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:28,880
because i don't think there is a single

1779
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,640
approach that could fit every needs in a

1780
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,480
digital tweet depending on the

1781
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,880
simulation you want to run you may need

1782
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,760
a very coarse data on a let's say

1783
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,000
intermediate basis or you may need to

1784
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,040
have very

1785
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,800
high fidelity data

1786
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,120
uh on different set of metrics and even

1787
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,800
sometimes you need to anticipate on the

1788
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,120
collection of some

1789
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,880
of some new measurements in order to

1790
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,400
have them ready when you want to run the

1791
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,640
simulation in between so my question is

1792
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,880
do you have a do you play or do you have

1793
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,120
knowledge about different methods or

1794
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,360
different research being done into

1795
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,000
processing

1796
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,120
how we can in fact uh evaluate a bit in

1797
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,520
advance or very dynamically what is the

1798
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,520
need expressed on the tree in terms of

1799
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,600
data collection and how we can in fact

1800
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,239
have methods that can optimize

1801
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:17,920
uh so i'm looking especially for

1802
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,719
optimization methods about

1803
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:23,360
what to collect when to collect etc so

1804
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,199
that we get a very good interplay

1805
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:26,560
between the real network and the

1806
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:27,840
connection the measurements we do on

1807
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,080
that and the need of the of the twin in

1808
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,920
terms of having the right data at the

1809
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,159
right time to make the right simulation

1810
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:36,000
so are you aware of some methods

1811
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,800
algorithm to look into this optimization

1812
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,560
not the mechanism to transport the data

1813
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,159
or collect data but really the

1814
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:44,159
intelligence in fact to to make the

1815
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,560
right data collection and to

1816
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,199
optimize this

1817
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:52,360
this function

1818
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,000
okay thank you for your

1819
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,199
values

1820
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:12,000
suggestion uh

1821
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,679
i will we will we will update

1822
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:20,159
this draft in the next video

1823
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,239
if you have any questions

1824
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:27,760
due to all time please email me to

1825
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,600
discuss thank you

1826
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,600
yeah okay i will uh we can discuss

1827
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,960
offline about

1828
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,360
my input and suggestions okay thank you

1829
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,120
we have also shane

1830
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,280
in the landline

1831
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,840
hi lauren

1832
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:53,440
for this chapter uh and i i i i really

1833
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,199
value your comments

1834
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:58,400
and uh surely we

1835
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,320
data collection of

1836
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,480
data aggregation of that data

1837
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,400
correlation or data

1838
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,440
or all data related domains are

1839
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:10,000
are really a very big

1840
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,560
big

1841
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,239
facts for

1842
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:17,360
building digital twin network and

1843
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,560
currently the scope of this structure is

1844
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,080
only for

1845
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,239
some case of the

1846
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:27,600
data collection uh in in that in those

1847
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,280
cases uh

1848
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,120
there is chance to

1849
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,400
aggregate

1850
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,000
all

1851
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,440
correlation or compromise some uh data

1852
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,280
uh raw data

1853
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:42,880
to to get more uh efficiency and

1854
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,960
also can achieve uh a high fidelity uh

1855
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,159
to build

1856
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:49,360
the twin

1857
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,159
so

1858
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:53,760
uh maybe we we next version we need to

1859
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:57,120
narrow or clarify the scope of our of

1860
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,760
this discharge

1861
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:03,199
of course another way is that if we want

1862
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:05,440
to

1863
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,400
mention all those all the

1864
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,400
cases of data collection

1865
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,120
we need to enlarge our

1866
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,920
job scope as well and to

1867
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,520
answer all your comments

1868
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,360
in the instructor and

1869
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:24,880
clarified more thank you

1870
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,480
good thank you yeah we definitely need

1871
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,080
to work together to

1872
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,239
progress in this work we can discuss

1873
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,400
offline of course thank you

1874
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,000
thank you

1875
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,800
okay just uh for the sake mohammed also

1876
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,560
i mentioned a comment in the chat i

1877
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,600
think we are slightly uh on time for the

1878
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,360
agenda let me just check

1879
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,840
so mohammed put on my first comment i

1880
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,360
don't think there is an answer for the

1881
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,120
first question raised by laurel as it

1882
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,040
depends on the application making using

1883
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,000
the

1884
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,040
making use of the digital twin

1885
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,600
if your app is for training purposes or

1886
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,760
for running what-if scenarios routine

1887
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,600
changes for example you don't need a

1888
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,679
full real-time synchronization or sync

1889
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,679
between them okay so these were comments

1890
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,679
of from mohamed in the

1891
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:13,120
chat and we will reflect that in a

1892
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,360
minute

1893
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,400
thank you

1894
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:22,519
let's switch to the next presentation

1895
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:44,639
oh

1896
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:47,840
oh can you hear me

1897
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:50,400
yes get there are you today

1898

01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:13,440
actually this is the fifth time to

1907
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,080
present the drops in this research group

1908
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,480
as we have presented since uh

1909
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,000
ietf108

1910

as main changes in uh dash five

1934
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,280
distortion we

1935
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,440
uh we

1936
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,360
mainly uh clarified the difference

1937
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,520
between digital twin network platforms

1938
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,120
and the legacy network management

1939
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,239
systems

1940
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:28,880
refined the description of the reference

1941
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:32,080
architecture and added references to

1942
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,040
digital twin network research

1943
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:38,000
we clarified the benefits of privacy and

1944
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,239
regulatory compliance

1945
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:43,120
and also we have also made some other

1946
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,920
editorial changes

1947
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,719
next slide please

1948
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:53,440
this table uh in this slide and next

1949
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,840
slide uh lists the major comments

1950
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:58,400
uh and our action taken

1951
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,520
uh here i will not describe them one by

1952
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:06,760
one in details uh next slide please

1953
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,800
uh i just give a um

1954
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:14,320
a brief uh uh a summary

1955
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,360
totally

1956
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,239
20 more comments were raised and

1957
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:19,280
addressed

1958
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,960
and we have

1959
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:24,159
either explained while email or made

1960
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:25,520
changes update

1961
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,320
in latest version

1962
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:31,799
next like please

1963
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,880
uh this slide shows uh the difference

1964
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,159
between a digital twin network and

1965
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:44,239
and other network frames

1966
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:45,760
frameworks

1967
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,280
as clarified in instruction section

1968
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,719
the main difference

1969
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:52,639
compared to other network management

1970
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:53,760
system

1971
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,560
is the use of interactive virtual rail

1972
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,960
mapping to build closed-loop network

1973
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,320
automation

1974
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,960
through the real-time deep interaction

1975
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,560
between the physical network and these

1976
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,880
two networks the digital twin network

1977
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,719
platform might help the network

1978
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:11,360
designers to achieve more

1979
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:12,800
simplification

1980
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,520
automatically resilient and for life

1981
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:18,880
cycle operations and maintenance

1982
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,199
digital twin uh network allows for uh

1983
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:24,239
integrating ai based uh mechanics

1984
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:25,600
mechanism

1985
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,360
emulating the behavior of network

1986
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,920
sections not under consideration but

1987
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:32,880
relevant for the considered section

1988
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,600
also for considering several parallel

1989
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,280
options or

1990
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,840
causes of action

1991
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:42,320
and for incorporating real-time

1992
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,800
monitoring data from physical

1993
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,080
with other real or virtual data sources

1994
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,440
and also for

1995
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,679
repeating and reproducing specific

1996
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:55,600
situations under controlled variations

1997
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,719
additionally the digital t network

1998
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:01,040
also help combines the features of

1999
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,440
network emulation and the software-based

2000
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:06,000
control environments

2001
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,280
next last slide please

2002
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:15,360
uh this slide shows the collaboration on

2003
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,360
the reference architecture

2004
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:20,320
uh in the uh three layer architecture we

2005
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:23,440
provided the top the lowest layer is

2006
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,520
physical

2007
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,440
physical network and top layer is a

2008
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:30,400
network application and the intermediate

2009
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,000
intermediate layer is the network

2010
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,560
digital twin this layer includes three

2011
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,000
key subsystems uh data repository

2012
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,480
service mapping models and the

2013
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,360
digital entity management

2014
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,920
uh this time in this version we propose

2015
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,280
an optional

2016
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:51,040
sub layer of collection and control

2017
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,440
data collection and the change control

2018
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,400
are regarded as a southbound influences

2019
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,360
between virtual and physical networks

2020
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,080
and for from a forum implementation

2021
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:03,280
perspective

2022
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:06,000
they can optionally form a sub layer or

2023
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
subsystem to provide the common

2024
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,080
functionalities of death clashing and

2025
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,159
control and chain control

2026
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:15,199
enabled by a specific infrastructure

2027
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:18,159
supporting bi-directional flows and

2028
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:20,719
facilitating data aggregation

2029
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:23,360
action translation of purpose pro

2030
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:26,719
processing and ontologies

2031
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:30,400
that's like this

2032
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,000
so uh

2033
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
uh about two slides away well i just uh

2034
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,320
described the major con

2035
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,840
updates from

2036
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:43,120
uh that from uh last meeting

2037
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,440
so for next step uh

2038
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,320
we believe that current staff is

2039
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,560
quite steep after uh

2040
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,639
five times of update

2041
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:55,040
so we are requesting uh document

2042
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,199
document adoption by

2043
01:26:57,199 --> 01:26:59,360
uh mrg

2044
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,159
so

2045
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:02,239
uh welcome to join our work and any

2046
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:05,120
comments are welcome

2047
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,159
and

2048
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:09,440
since time permits i'd like to share two

2049
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,600
more sliding appendix so next slide

2050
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,480
please thank you

2051
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,760
based on the

2052
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,760
reference architecture replied in the

2053
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,320
draft we stretched we stressed to

2054
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,920
suggest that

2055
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,320
some key enabling technologies

2056
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,679
for

2057
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:28,560
building digital networks

2058
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,520
can should be studied firstly

2059
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,320
in future and this slides and just lists

2060
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:37,679
the five uh enabling technologies

2061
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:41,440
the first is data collection

2062
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:44,639
including diverse existing tools

2063
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:46,800
for for example

2064
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,679
smp netcom telemetry int

2065
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:50,719
etc

2066
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:53,679
uh and in innovative new tools uh for

2067
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:56,080
example sketch based measurement

2068
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,000
uh and also uh

2069
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,960
that the tools can

2070
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,199
can include

2071
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:05,920
semantic and aggregation mechanisms for

2072
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,560
data integration and

2073
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,960
action translation

2074
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,760
uh this is first the second technology

2075
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,920
is data storage and the services

2076
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,080
unified the data repository to

2077
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:20,320
effectively effectively

2078
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,360
store

2079
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:22,800
large-scale and

2080
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,600
heterogeneous network data and to

2081
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,840
provide these services including fast

2082
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:28,800
search

2083
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,560
batch data handling uh conflict

2084
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,360
avoidance uh data access interfaces

2085
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,600
etc etc

2086
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,239
and the third is date modeling uh for

2087
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:40,880
small scale network network simulation

2088
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:45,440
tool uh for example uh iso i3 uh gms3

2089
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,679
can be an option uh for large scale

2090
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:50,320
network uh we believe a low cost

2091
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,760
solution

2092
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:54,320
should be required to create a network

2093
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,840
element

2094
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,920
topology models

2095
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,760
and

2096
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:03,199
ai and machine learning can be used to

2097
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:06,159
build complex functional models in twin

2098
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:08,000
entity

2099
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,040
the fourth

2100
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:12,400
technology is visualization uh including

2101
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:15,280
displaying the network topology option

2102
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:18,000
operational status in multiple

2103
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,920
dimensions and finding grand granularity

2104
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,400
and using interactive

2105
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,560
visualizing to help users better

2106
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,880
understand to use and explore the

2107
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,000
network interfaces and protocols

2108
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,239
the fifth the fifth is

2109
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:37,199
interfaces including twin interfaces

2110
01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:39,679
application facing interfaces and

2111
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:41,760
internal interfaces they can choose

2112
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,800
different type of tool or protocol as

2113
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,400
required

2114
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,880
i know that these technologies are not

2115
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:51,360
in the scope of this jobs

2116
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:54,480
but we believe that based on this option

2117
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:57,760
they can be started separately in future

2118
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:01,120
in this rmrg group

2119
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:04,519
next slide please

2120
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:07,840
uh let's let's choose the

2121
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:12,480
the uh that moves the searches um on

2122
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:16,000
applying digital twin to network uh in

2123
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,760
academia more research efforts apply the

2124
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,320
digital twin concepts to network fields

2125
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:25,360
including edge computing system

2126
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,719
industrial

2127
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:29,280
internet of things 5g network

2128
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:32,280
etc

2129
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,880
shank are you still online i cannot hear

2130
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:46,120
you anymore

2131
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:51,760
is it the same for other participants

2132
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,600
it's the same for me at least

2133
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,639
okay so saying it seems that you've been

2134
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:01,199
cut off the audio stream and i still see

2135
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:02,960
you online as possible

2136
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:05,360
okay offline

2137
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:08,320
anyway we have reached the end of the

2138
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,320
near the end of this slot

2139
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,639
i like to open up for

2140
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:16,440
questions if you can

2141
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
do we have questions on the presentation

2142
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,800
for this draft

2143
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:25,920
because we have to go also through the

2144
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:28,480
uh request for the call for adoption

2145
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:31,839
shang are you back online

2146
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,760
shane can you speak to see if we can

2147
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:38,920
hear you

2148
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,800
can you hear me

2149
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,600
shane yes try to speak again

2150
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,840
oh sorry sorry uh my my network is

2151
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,440
broken uh

2152
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,679
sorry i used this light

2153
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:58,480
we just want to shoot more samples

2154
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,480
on applying digital to network

2155
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,560
in academia there are

2156
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,840
several

2157
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,360
researchers

2158
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:06,400
in

2159
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,199
computing biology networking and also in

2160
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:11,280
industrial iot

2161
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,840
and

2162
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:14,560
this

2163
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:15,760
uh

2164
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:18,080
sharia gave us another example

2165
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,320
and the industrial uh industry uh more

2166
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,400
companies are investing solutions of

2167
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,440
digital networking including aeronautics

2168
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:28,159
network rva and spider

2169
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:30,719
that's a better solution

2170
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:34,159
so we believe that

2171
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:37,120
our work in armored energy is a right

2172
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:39,760
way and also helpful to clarify the

2173
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,960
concept of digital network as well to

2174
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,480
provide the reference architecture to

2175
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,520
both

2176
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,000
academia or industry

2177
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,120
so thank you that's all

2178
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,920
thank you shane uh we have kieran online

2179
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:59,520
please kieran

2180
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,920
hi am i audible

2181
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,040
yes

2182
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,360
okay i just have a quick clarification

2183
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,760
question that when we define digital

2184
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:10,560
twin network is it uh

2185
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,800
are there multiple instances that we are

2186
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,760
abstracting from a physical network or

2187
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,159
is it a representation of the entire

2188
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:22,519
physical network in one shot

2189
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,400
okay uh

2190
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,960
okay in our opinion that

2191
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,840
when we set the digital twin network it

2192
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:35,280
should uh uh contain both uh twin

2193
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:38,320
network and the physical network

2194
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:41,199
is our opinion and also the the point in

2195
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:44,080
this uh job

2196
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:47,400
thank you

2197
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,320
okay

2198
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:59,600
thank you

2199
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,639
so uh you you express request for a call

2200
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:04,159
for adoption as a research group

2201
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:06,000
document and um

2202
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,639
as said also for the previous draft

2203
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:12,159
we follow a let's see a group procedures

2204
01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:15,199
uh to validate some criteria to see a

2205
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:16,000
bit

2206
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,239
the feeling of the research group on

2207
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:19,600
adopting this as a research group

2208
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:20,800
document

2209
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,800
so usually we take it offline on the

2210
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,400
mailing list that we have time to

2211
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,800
collect expression for from all the

2212
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,639
participants

2213
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:31,040
um i just share my viewer more as a

2214
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,120
participant right now i think it's uh

2215
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,800
interesting to see

2216
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,800
an architecture document

2217
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,960
for the trump digital twin

2218
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:42,080
uh as you say the document has matured

2219
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:44,719
for for some time now so

2220
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:46,800
i think it's a good time to have this

2221
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,360
call for for research group adoption but

2222
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,600
i i like to see uh through the answer of

2223
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:52,320
the

2224
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,760
different criteria

2225
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,520
uh where we want to go with this

2226
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:58,080
architectural document and if uh let's

2227
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,560
say it's comprehensive and mature enough

2228
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:01,760
in uh

2229
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,760
in the coverage for as an architecture

2230
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,080
for natural digital twin and if we can

2231
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:08,239
lay down based on this architectural

2232
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:09,280
document

2233
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:12,159
a set of let's say research questions or

2234
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:14,400
challenges

2235
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,159
that could feed in fact research into

2236
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:17,520
the research group on these questions

2237
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:18,800
because we have seen that there are also

2238
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,560
other drafts other projects working on

2239
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,159
that so i think it's an interesting

2240
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:24,320
trend and i think we need also maybe to

2241
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,560
articulate a bit some of the research

2242
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,199
directions that we could explore

2243
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:30,560
in the research group and i think this

2244
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,560
architectural document could be a

2245
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,800
foundation to

2246
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,760
identify or highlight such directions so

2247
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,679
this is for me as a participant some

2248
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:41,040
feedback i would like to provide for a

2249
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,600
protocol for for myself adoption

2250
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,760
i will put that uh in a into the mailing

2251
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,679
list but i will leave also maybe to

2252
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:52,800
steer this discussion

2253
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:55,040
thank you lauren thank you

2254
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:58,800
um i think uh yeah this draft has been

2255
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,880
also presented multiple times

2256
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,639
i think uh uh it was very interesting

2257
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:04,639
the the last live presentation with the

2258
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:06,320
different let's say uh

2259
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,639
let's say

2260
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:10,639
enabler that you need for digital

2261
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:12,719
networks and i think it can be really

2262
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:13,760
useful

2263
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,280
for actually articulating this

2264
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,440
discussion of what uh what we need

2265
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,920
actually for having this uh having these

2266
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,360
digital twins

2267
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:24,239
so uh yeah i think it uh

2268
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:26,239
it could be a very good good point also

2269
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:28,639
to have this as uh already serving as a

2270
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:31,040
purpose for the discussions

2271
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,520
and uh maybe more formally now for the

2272
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:36,800
uh for the confirmation so as long as

2273
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:37,760
so

2274
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:40,400
there is a kind of uh let's say it's not

2275
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,560
formal but it's something that we define

2276
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:45,119
in a number g as a procedure for the uh

2277
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:46,960
corporate reduction so

2278
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,639
as um

2279
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:52,480
as we um as we already um

2280
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:55,600
did in the for previous documents so

2281
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,480
um if uh i think the first thing as

2282
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,800
usual is

2283
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,199
as to to have the different feedback and

2284
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:05,679
then the mailing list and

2285
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:08,480
update the draft and then uh if

2286
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:10,560
after after this maybe the next round of

2287
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,560
discussion you might have with maybe use

2288
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,960
laura or his other participants that

2289
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:17,360
provide you some some some discussion

2290
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:20,560
some comments after this meeting we can

2291
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:23,360
uh we can then of course

2292
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:24,800
send the call for adoption of the

2293
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,159
mailing list

2294
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:29,040
and uh you know it will be done somehow

2295
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:31,760
offline on the mailing list to

2296
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,199
have um

2297
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:34,960
to ever do the

2298
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:37,440
opinion of more people because most of

2299
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,040
the times have more people

2300
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,880
that express our opinion in that case

2301
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,480
regarding the quality of the document

2302
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:44,400
the scope all these cases can support

2303
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,159
the group and so on

2304
01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:47,460
so yeah so

2305
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:49,280
[Music]

2306
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,199
as we say yeah there is a

2307
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:53,440
there is procedure i can send use a link

2308
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:55,119
as well as well if i

2309
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:56,639
will find it

2310
01:37:56,639 --> 01:37:58,880
just to maybe recall what we have to

2311
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:02,600
define for that

2312
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:08,400
okay thank you thank you chair

2313
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:13,879
there's some comments on the chat right

2314
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,800
okay there are some i think quite a lot

2315
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,800
of commenters in the chat maybe we can

2316
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:37,199
copy paste and uh

2317
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:39,760
in the minutes uh for further discussion

2318
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:41,280
because i think we have to move to the

2319
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:45,000
next explanation

2320
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,430
the next one is

2321
01:38:51,430 --> 01:38:53,679
[Music]

2322
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:56,159
with the ai framework

2323
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:59,760
from the top manager and it's paid work

2324
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,119
hi

2325
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:02,880
hello you hear me

2326
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,719
yes perfect

2327
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:05,760
okay

2328
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,119
so

2329
01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:08,800
i will just

2330
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:11,199
presenting

2331
01:39:11,199 --> 01:39:12,400
this new

2332
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,080
draft that is

2333
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:17,280
one evolution from one previous draft we

2334
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,920
have is in relation as you can see here

2335
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,360
in the title the

2336
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,639
relation to the

2337
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:24,480
definition of artificial intelligence

2338
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:27,040
framework for network management

2339
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:30,320
next slide please

2340
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,440
thank you

2341
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:34,480
okay

2342
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:37,600
so uh in general from from the context

2343
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,800
of this

2344
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:41,520
draft and this framework

2345
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:44,159
so we we know that automating the

2346
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:45,760
network management

2347
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:48,320
with ai enables

2348
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:52,080
computer networks to any processor to go

2349
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:55,520
and we are uh uh currently dealing with

2350
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:58,320
the exponential growth

2351
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:01,119
thinking for supporting iot and this

2352
01:40:01,119 --> 01:40:03,760
last uh detangling functions that we are

2353
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:04,880
seeing so

2354
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:05,760
there are

2355
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:09,440
a lot of hurdles that must be

2356
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,520
resolved in network management that the

2357
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:12,960
ai can

2358
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:15,520
can do okay so

2359
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:16,560
similar

2360
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,639
mechanisms

2361
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:23,280
uh have been to to define to to to

2362
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,760
to to achieve these ai functions but

2363
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:28,880
they must interpret in some way so we we

2364
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:31,600
need some framework that's the the key

2365
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:33,760
of this

2366
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:36,480
this draft is to define this framework

2367
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,920
that is needed

2368
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:39,440
to

2369
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,920
to ensure the seamless connection among

2370
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:43,920
all components and participants in this

2371
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:45,440
network management

2372
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,159
like for example we must define one

2373
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:50,400
ontology so everybody

2374
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,840
all components

2375
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,560
are

2376
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:53,760
talking

2377
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,920
about the same concepts and things like

2378
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:58,880
that we need to define some kind of

2379
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:01,920
interfaces for different components so

2380
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,840
the operation must be

2381
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,119
more or less

2382
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:09,760
well known by all of them and finally we

2383
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,520
need some method to assess the correct

2384
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,760
handling of of

2385
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:18,800
of those elements so for example

2386
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:21,520
somebody can validate if one element one

2387
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:23,760
component is is

2388
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:26,960
actually doing what it must

2389
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:29,760
is supposed to do and actually also for

2390
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:32,480
example for some uh developer or

2391
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:36,159
integrator to find out that that the

2392
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:39,199
specification of components is actually

2393
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:42,880
what they need not just

2394
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,800
the company is working as expected but

2395
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,280
also the feed the company fits with the

2396
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,360
needs of some software

2397
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:50,800
next slide please

2398
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:51,500
so uh

2399
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:52,800
[Music]

2400
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:55,920
the the background notice is quite uh

2401
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:58,000
stretch forward we we begin with the

2402
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,600
definition of particular computer and

2403
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,360
ecosystem

2404
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:03,119
today they have high degree of

2405
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:05,440
flexibility and reliability and as you

2406
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:08,239
all know know sdn and fb conceptually

2407
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:10,400
are centralized or only conceptually but

2408
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:13,040
they can be distributed implementation

2409
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:14,400
and they uh

2410
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:15,440
reuse

2411
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:19,679
functions so as software so we we are

2412
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:21,119
now talking about

2413
01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:24,320
enormous flexibility and almost

2414
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:25,920
amount of functionality that we can

2415
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,840
manage to to in order to build the

2416
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:30,800
network okay so

2417
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:33,440
this is increasing the complexity of

2418
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:37,040
underlying systems and and

2419
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:39,920
they must perform dynamic adaptation in

2420
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,520
order to

2421
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:42,800
optimize

2422
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:45,600
be optimized for for different workloads

2423
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,760
and different scenarios there's a slight

2424
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:48,719
piece

2425
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:50,159
in addition

2426
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:52,400
additionally from from the background we

2427
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:54,400
also have

2428
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:55,600
that

2429
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,520
i

2430
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:00,639
want to remain this is that

2431
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:01,840
we are all

2432
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:03,760
everybody is very

2433
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,239
familiar with the concept of uh machine

2434
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:08,560
learning and how it's been it has been

2435
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:11,360
applied into the network but

2436
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:14,880
again i i i want to insist now that ai

2437
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,480
is not machine learning and there are a

2438
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,879
lot of

2439
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:21,840
benefits from ai beyond machine learning

2440
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,320
like for example perception reasoning

2441
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,400
and planning that must be exploited but

2442
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,480
for for network management

2443
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,080
uh as you know

2444
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:32,000
many many people know us already i've

2445
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,440
been in collaborating with this group in

2446
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:38,719
in this sense now in order to to provide

2447
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:41,920
some kind of of challenges or

2448
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:44,159
at least some kind of

2449
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:46,400
topic for discuss in this in this

2450
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,639
direction so i retake this

2451
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:50,800
and again i insist that intelligence for

2452
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,400
example is is

2453
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:54,480
different from intelligent in the in

2454
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:56,400
this case we are

2455
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,159
dealing with

2456
01:43:58,159 --> 01:44:00,639
the data gathering and management for

2457
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:03,360
example for building one digital twin or

2458
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,440
uh or just

2459
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:09,040
demonstrating some hypotheses or some

2460
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:11,679
for for for network management

2461
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:13,920
we need a lot of

2462
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:16,080
data and we need to gather that data and

2463
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:19,440
we need to do that with some systematic

2464
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:20,960
methods so

2465
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,679
they are also needed in this framework

2466
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:26,320
that i am discussing today

2467
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:28,000
and on the other hand intelligent

2468
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,639
emphasizes on how that data is actually

2469
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,800
processed so we have machine learning we

2470
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:36,719
have other kinds of of of

2471
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:37,920
interpreting

2472
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:40,480
ways of interpreting the information so

2473
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:42,880
we do that integer intelligently so

2474
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,960
that's the the main difference in this

2475
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:48,480
in this sense next slide please

2476
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:49,360
oh

2477
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:50,239
i

2478
01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:52,320
i just wanted to

2479
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:54,480
give an end to these fragrances

2480
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:56,880
and then my is is intended to be a

2481
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:58,639
genetic scalable and deployable and

2482
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:00,400
truth to worthy

2483
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,639
ai framework for network management

2484
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:03,360
the

2485
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:06,560
the idea is to to

2486
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:10,880
provide the the the roots for designing

2487
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:12,719
deploying instantiating scaling and

2488
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:15,440
validating ai solutions for network

2489
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,760
operation management

2490
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:21,440
and also a different way we will be

2491
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:24,400
particularly focused on entering network

2492
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,560
management because with the

2493
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,400
currently there are

2494
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:29,440
many

2495
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:31,600
focus on this on this side

2496
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:31,930
and

2497
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:33,840
[Music]

2498
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:35,600
many interesting

2499
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:38,880
workflows are

2500
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,080
being

2501
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,639
dispatched from the end-to-end

2502
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:44,639
services and we need to to deal with

2503
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:48,239
them particularly so uh key components

2504
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:50,320
and on this framework we have of course

2505
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:53,360
the data framework itself is part of the

2506
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,760
is how to to to

2507
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:59,280
define the data that is being

2508
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:02,000
acquired how to model the data store and

2509
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,360
distribute

2510
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:06,239
any kind of data this part for example

2511
01:46:06,239 --> 01:46:08,639
is also

2512
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:11,199
related to the data collection that has

2513
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:14,239
been previously discussed in in terms

2514
01:46:14,239 --> 01:46:15,440
for for

2515
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:17,600
providing providing that data to build

2516
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:20,080
one digital twin the data framework will

2517
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,239
be interconnected to this kind of of

2518
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:24,719
data collection also

2519
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:26,560
functions for aggregating data in the

2520
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,800
sources and things like that

2521
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:31,280
so in addition to the to the data

2522
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:32,880
collection and data formatting modeling

2523
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:34,320
etc

2524
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:35,360
the idea

2525
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:38,000
is that its component provides also some

2526
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,119
way of

2527
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:41,280
communicating the data

2528
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,199
efficiently to the

2529
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:46,719
elements that need that okay

2530
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:50,960
in addition we have the ai modules

2531
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,280
they are

2532
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:56,159
functions mainly that are implementing

2533
01:46:56,159 --> 01:46:58,880
the processing of the data individually

2534
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:00,800
or collectively

2535
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:03,119
we have many

2536
01:47:03,119 --> 01:47:05,360
schemes or many organizations of this

2537
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:06,880
kind of modules that are sharing

2538
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:10,400
information and that can

2539
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:12,639
do individual processing or

2540
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:14,560
collaborative processing

2541
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,199
in this in this sense we have also

2542
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:19,199
end-to-end or global intelligent tasks

2543
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:21,679
that must be addressed so

2544
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:23,600
these a modules will collaborate in

2545
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:26,480
order to to achieve this this tax

2546
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,880
okay and finally we have the what we

2547
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:31,840
define the hub we will be we'll receive

2548
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:34,159
all the data knowledge and and all

2549
01:47:34,159 --> 01:47:37,920
decisions etc and will be

2550
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:40,239
shared again

2551
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:42,800
with all modules so every all

2552
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:46,080
information will be shared in this hub

2553
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:47,840
so all modules can access the

2554
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:50,000
information previous for example

2555
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,880
previous reports previous notifications

2556
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:56,239
previous data current data etc and also

2557
01:47:56,239 --> 01:47:58,639
after one module has finished its work

2558
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,480
will provide this information to this

2559
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:04,080
hub this has been

2560
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:05,520
this

2561
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:08,400
not just the hub this this schema is

2562
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:11,199
being currently being used by

2563
01:48:11,199 --> 01:48:12,480
many

2564
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:15,920
let's say intelligence frameworks

2565
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:18,800
to collect intelligence information to

2566
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:19,600
to

2567
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:24,639
manage that information and to also

2568
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:26,880
let's say to provide the information to

2569
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,280
the interested stakeholders

2570
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:31,199
all that

2571
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:35,679
process operations and processes must be

2572
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:38,560
let's say organized no by by this this

2573
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:39,840
af framework

2574
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,719
that's a slide please

2575
01:48:42,719 --> 01:48:46,320
oh as an overview of this operation so

2576
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:47,600
we we will

2577
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:50,639
first have the

2578
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:53,679
exposes like this there

2579
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:54,400
we

2580
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:57,840
will first have the i i know say it

2581
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:01,679
the data collection subprocess is

2582
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:03,440
again just

2583
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:05,760
summarize it here it retrieves the

2584
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,280
performance measurements

2585
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:09,679
from the computer or network system that

2586
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:12,320
is being managed

2587
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:15,679
second we have a resonance process that

2588
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:17,840
receives the collected data

2589
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:19,760
and uh and

2590
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,920
receive for example additional context i

2591
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:24,400
also mentioned this that would be some

2592
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:26,960
kind of information that is provided by

2593
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:30,560
external elements that

2594
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:34,000
from outside the network

2595
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,400
i call them those external events or

2596
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:39,679
external element this is the

2597
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:42,960
sorry standalones let's say

2598
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:45,360
well and that information will be

2599
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:48,400
used by finding to find out the rules

2600
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:50,560
that are governing the current situation

2601
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:52,320
of the network

2602
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:53,679
then the third

2603
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:54,960
through process would be the solving

2604
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,840
subprocess that is that guess the the

2605
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:00,560
situation and rules previously

2606
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:04,000
obtained to build some dynamic knowledge

2607
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,639
graph that means to gather together all

2608
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:08,320
the knowledge that represent the current

2609
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:10,239
situation of the network the knowledge

2610
01:50:10,239 --> 01:50:12,320
graph of course must follow some

2611
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:15,599
particular ontology as i defined before

2612
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:17,119
and it's

2613
01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:18,120
it is

2614
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:19,440
[Music]

2615
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:21,199
worked in this

2616
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:23,440
solving process the knowledge graph the

2617
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:26,400
base is worker in order to find an

2618
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,800
acceptable situation so the transform

2619
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:31,760
the the the actions that must be

2620
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:34,320
applied to this knowledge graph in order

2621
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:36,880
to find one acceptable situation

2622
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,760
will be later in the uh in the next uh

2623
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:41,199
super process by the planning show

2624
01:50:41,199 --> 01:50:43,599
process will be

2625
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:48,239
used to correct the network or to

2626
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:51,040
let's say adapt the network to some

2627
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:53,520
current situation or future problem to

2628
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:55,920
prevent future problems okay and how to

2629
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:58,000
do that is the final show process the

2630
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
planning process will

2631
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,040
will get the actions that might be

2632
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:06,560
executed in order to to achieve this uh

2633
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:09,199
coverage as a type of situation and plan

2634
01:51:09,199 --> 01:51:11,040
them how to apply them into the

2635
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,960
networking

2636
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:16,159
for to ensure they are correctly

2637
01:51:16,159 --> 01:51:18,880
enforced in the network

2638
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:21,840
next slide please

2639
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:24,719
in addition to

2640
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:26,320
to the

2641
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,320
this

2642
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,080
operation

2643
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:32,400
we in the in the draft we also define

2644
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:36,000
some concepts that must be

2645
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,920
let's say researcher and also

2646
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:43,199
organized in this kind of framework like

2647
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:44,400
for example

2648
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,560
this particular support for the closet

2649
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:49,840
loop okay all managers or management

2650
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:52,880
solutions especially the

2651
01:51:53,119 --> 01:51:56,239
automated management solutions have are

2652
01:51:56,239 --> 01:51:59,520
aware of some kind of closer loop so but

2653
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:02,080
we need to define particular

2654
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:04,320
particularly how these closely loop can

2655
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:06,480
be

2656
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:09,920
implemented so we need to

2657
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:12,960
in this af framework we need to

2658
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:14,719
to ensure

2659
01:52:14,719 --> 01:52:16,719
that there are some

2660
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:18,080
let's say

2661
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:21,119
interfaces and some data data formats

2662
01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:22,639
that are

2663
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:25,920
particularly focused to allow

2664
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:27,840
the management solutions to

2665
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,760
ensure this closer loop

2666
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:32,719
can be let's say can be real because the

2667
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:34,719
the closing the loop is

2668
01:52:34,719 --> 01:52:37,119
is step forward in in

2669
01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:38,960
by implementing one single management

2670
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:41,520
solution but when we are talking about

2671
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:43,360
different solutions that are

2672
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:45,920
interoperating that is

2673
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:47,679
much

2674
01:52:47,679 --> 01:52:49,280
much more difficult

2675
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:50,320
okay

2676
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,960
in addition we we also must deal with

2677
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:54,320
the concept of

2678
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:57,440
network intelligence again i insist that

2679
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,520
difference from intelligent in general

2680
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:01,840
no but with me that

2681
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:05,679
this means that data analytics that max

2682
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:09,040
that are complementing the ai methods

2683
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:11,360
like for example incorporating a target

2684
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:13,760
entry automated intelligent methods that

2685
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:16,639
means that we have some kind of target

2686
01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:18,719
definition for the for the network

2687
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:21,040
management solution and the network

2688
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:24,239
introducing processes will just try to

2689
01:53:24,239 --> 01:53:26,239
find and get all the information

2690
01:53:26,239 --> 01:53:29,040
required in order to to

2691
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:30,000
to

2692
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,679
accomplish that target is is not just to

2693
01:53:33,679 --> 01:53:35,199
watch the network

2694
01:53:35,199 --> 01:53:36,960
to see what is happening no it's the

2695
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:39,679
opposite in this in this case we first

2696
01:53:39,679 --> 01:53:42,320
we first establish a target

2697
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:45,440
and then we work in order to

2698
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:49,920
find out evidence or find out any

2699
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:50,719
any

2700
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:53,040
data that is required to

2701
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:56,000
demonstrate or to

2702
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,800
achieve the targeted general okay

2703
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,800
next concept is the external level

2704
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:04,080
detectors again i insist this to get

2705
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:07,199
i discussed about them previously but is

2706
01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:09,840
to include in the ai framework we need

2707
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:13,280
to model how information from outside

2708
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:15,920
the network is will cross the boundaries

2709
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:18,880
and and be introduced inside the the

2710
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:20,880
network management

2711
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:23,599
solutions and how to correlate that can

2712
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:25,280
that information can be correlated with

2713
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:26,719
with what is happening inside the

2714
01:54:26,719 --> 01:54:28,080
network let's say performance

2715
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:30,639
measurements so all of these

2716
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:33,840
will be also the or must be also some

2717
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:35,840
some kind of

2718
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:37,920
defined in this framework let's slide

2719
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,239
this

2720
01:54:41,119 --> 01:54:43,920
and two other concepts are

2721
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:46,560
the anticipation of network requirements

2722
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:48,239
instead of just

2723
01:54:48,239 --> 01:54:52,239
exploiting ai uh for predicting what we

2724
01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:54,000
are currently doing for example for

2725
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,320
machine learning we are predicting what

2726
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:57,520
can be

2727
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:00,239
the the near future but instead of just

2728
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:04,639
doing that we can focus on what i

2729
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:06,880
i was defining about

2730
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,800
anticipation let's say

2731
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,080
to find

2732
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:13,599
the situations and the events that will

2733
01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:16,960
be dispatched are will be surely

2734
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:20,080
happening where we are we can be sure

2735
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:23,280
they are happening so we must anticipate

2736
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:25,679
the impact of the in the network of some

2737
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:29,199
for example let's say one uh

2738
01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:32,560
flash cloud event that is happening so

2739
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:35,599
we can know exactly what what that will

2740
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:37,280
trigger in the network

2741
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:39,760
and we cannot anticipate to that

2742
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:42,320
but it's not just prediction it's not

2743
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:44,480
something that we can fail no we it's

2744
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:47,440
something that's sure so we can focus

2745
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:49,679
we can have a particular focus to this

2746
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:52,239
because we will have much more time

2747
01:55:52,239 --> 01:55:55,119
to to analyze for example in the case of

2748
01:55:55,119 --> 01:55:56,719
digital twins we can

2749
01:55:56,719 --> 01:55:59,199
one situation that we anticipate we can

2750
01:55:59,199 --> 01:56:01,520
input that to the digital twin and see

2751
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:03,599
what hap what can happen the easter twin

2752
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:05,920
can say oh well this is most probably to

2753
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:07,679
happen it's okay

2754
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:08,639
or not

2755
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:10,560
we can say the opposite but in these

2756
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:12,080
cases

2757
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:14,000
i insist is anticipation not just

2758
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,280
prediction so

2759
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:17,599
is is

2760
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:20,000
it can be a bit different only but at

2761
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:20,960
the end

2762
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:22,400
when you

2763
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:25,280
think about the implications of

2764
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:27,520
in the in the definitions and

2765
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,560
is

2766
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:30,239
very different

2767
01:56:30,239 --> 01:56:32,080
and finally is

2768
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:34,000
the the reasoning

2769
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:34,719
i

2770
01:56:34,719 --> 01:56:38,239
support for intelligent reasoning is

2771
01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:40,080
there are many methods that for example

2772
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:42,480
the machine learning and even

2773
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:44,080
for example particular

2774
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:47,199
neural networks that are quite good on

2775
01:56:47,199 --> 01:56:49,760
obtaining some kind of of

2776
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:51,599
classification or prediction from some

2777
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:55,760
data okay but the full reasoning process

2778
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:57,510
must be

2779
01:56:57,510 --> 01:56:59,119
[Music]

2780
01:56:59,119 --> 01:57:01,040
must be let's say

2781
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:02,400
researcher

2782
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:06,480
in terms of to to to be uh

2783
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:08,080
modeled and to be for example

2784
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:09,920
complemented with metadata and things

2785
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:11,840
like that so we can

2786
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:14,400
for example achieve some kind of

2787
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:18,159
explanation or find out some explanation

2788
01:57:18,159 --> 01:57:21,199
to to the actions that are automatically

2789
01:57:21,199 --> 01:57:24,080
obtained by this ai framework

2790
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:26,239
insisting in the wrestling of course

2791
01:57:26,239 --> 01:57:29,119
next slide please

2792
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:33,140
finally it's just the most

2793
01:57:33,140 --> 01:57:34,400
[Music]

2794
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:37,520
let's see just two out of uh

2795
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:40,400
highlight the the most uh important

2796
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:43,119
issues that i come i find here

2797
01:57:43,119 --> 01:57:45,280
in this ai framework would be just to

2798
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:46,239
define

2799
01:57:46,239 --> 01:57:48,000
common interfaces

2800
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,080
so we need to define

2801
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:52,400
the the gaps we we don't have interfaces

2802
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:54,239
for allowing

2803
01:57:54,239 --> 01:57:58,080
several ai modules to talk to each other

2804
01:57:58,080 --> 01:57:59,760
and that is important because in the

2805
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:02,159
future we will have several vendors that

2806
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:05,520
can provide specific functions ai

2807
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:08,320
functions that we we will go in one

2808
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:11,199
direction or another and and

2809
01:58:11,199 --> 01:58:13,520
most of them can be able to talk to each

2810
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:15,920
other so it's important to this

2811
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:17,599
define these interfaces including the

2812
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:20,320
ontology i previously discussed

2813
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:23,199
okay so also the component assessment

2814
01:58:23,199 --> 01:58:25,119
and quality assurance is another thing

2815
01:58:25,119 --> 01:58:26,320
that

2816
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:28,400
introduced it before is to

2817
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:33,199
standardize or define some kind of of

2818
01:58:33,199 --> 01:58:35,280
common methods

2819
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:38,080
to know to find out

2820
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:40,880
the quality of one component to ensure

2821
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:43,840
it fits with the quality we are

2822
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:46,320
expecting and to ensure it fits with our

2823
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:49,320
requirements

2824
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:52,400
in addition is the synchronized concepts

2825
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:55,920
and ontologies this means that when

2826
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:57,840
different

2827
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:00,560
stakeholders are working with different

2828
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:02,880
concepts they must be

2829
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:05,280
exchanged together in order to ensure

2830
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:07,679
that for example again i said no several

2831
01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:08,560
ai

2832
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:11,040
modules and the network elements

2833
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:13,920
all are talking the same are

2834
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:16,239
knowing the same concept but when one

2835
01:59:16,239 --> 01:59:19,360
new entity is dealing with one

2836
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:22,480
is creating one new concept how that

2837
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:24,800
will be automatically

2838
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:26,560
communicated to the other elements so

2839
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:28,880
the other elements can be aware of this

2840
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:30,639
new concept

2841
01:59:30,639 --> 01:59:33,040
and finally is how to

2842
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:35,040
in some way limit

2843
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:37,520
the information dissemination as as you

2844
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:39,679
know if we

2845
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:42,960
are working in one new arena with all

2846
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:45,520
several ai

2847
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:47,520
modules talking to each other when we

2848
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:49,920
introduce some information

2849
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:51,599
sometimes

2850
01:59:51,599 --> 01:59:54,639
i will say that yes sometimes we want we

2851
01:59:54,639 --> 01:59:57,360
want that information to be just

2852
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:59,119
disclose it to some

2853
01:59:59,119 --> 02:00:01,599
elements not all the elements

2854
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:03,199
so how we

2855
02:00:03,199 --> 02:00:05,440
we are able to

2856
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:06,800
limit this

2857
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:08,630
i don't want to talk about

2858
02:00:08,630 --> 02:00:09,840
[Music]

2859
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:12,320
really bad mechanisms for that but we

2860
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:16,320
need to some some in some way limit the

2861
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:19,440
the the the scope limit the the the

2862
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:20,800
level of dissemination of some

2863
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:23,920
information you know

2864
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:28,159
yeah because i'm sorry already over time

2865
02:00:28,159 --> 02:00:29,679
i'm sorry i'm sorry i didn't know that's

2866
02:00:29,679 --> 02:00:33,679
all this i'm sorry and uh

2867
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:37,920
it's the end so i i i finished

2868
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:39,440
okay yeah you have a lot of having good

2869
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:41,599
good inputs to the discussion but we

2870
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:44,719
have to to be uh straight on

2871
02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:46,400
uh just very quickly oligarchy or

2872
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:48,719
something

2873
02:00:51,199 --> 02:00:54,199
olga

2874
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:03,599
just one comment like i think it would

2875
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:07,199
be beneficial to add maybe the intent

2876
02:01:07,199 --> 02:01:10,960
driven uh approach to the ai framework

2877
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:12,719
you know because i do see that you have

2878
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:13,679
kind of

2879
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:16,800
uh mentioned other contexts in one place

2880
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,960
but all and common interfaces but i do

2881
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:21,599
believe it would be beneficial to say

2882
02:01:21,599 --> 02:01:23,440
how it relates to the intent driven

2883
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:24,560
approach

2884
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:27,440
and how they can uh

2885
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:29,599
how they can uh

2886
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:31,840
coexist together you know because i do

2887
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:33,840
believe there is a intent-driven

2888
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:35,440
approach that would be

2889
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:36,400
beneficial

2890
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:39,599
in the ai framework going forward

2891
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:42,239
okay thank you i will i take note i will

2892
02:01:42,239 --> 02:01:45,440
uh try to in to let's say

2893
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:47,520
interconnect this

2894
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:50,320
with the intent based approach we are we

2895
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:51,440
are also

2896
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:52,719
already you know

2897
02:01:52,719 --> 02:01:54,880
in this in this way but i will

2898

on this last presentation from petal i

2904
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:11,920

2906
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:15,280
bring that offline to the mailing list

2909
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:21,520
this activity

2910
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:23,119
falls into the activity of the research

2911
02:02:23,119 --> 02:02:24,560
group it connects maybe with other
