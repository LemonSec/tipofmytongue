um

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,040
if we could have a volunteer to just

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,720
monitor the jabber

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,880
room that would be awesome if someone

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,360
wants to volunteer for that i will be

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,799
taking minutes if someone else also

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,799
wants to take minutes that would be

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,960
great as well uh blue sheets are taken

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,000

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,400
otherwise

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,439
sanji will have to do

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,640
i don't think there's going to be a lot

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,520
going on in in the jabra room but

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,479
someone should just take a peek

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,360
ah thanks chris awesome

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,119
uh all right

42
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,040
then we will move on

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,439
um these are the existing milestones for

44
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,640
the working group

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,719
um we're going to be talking about uri

46
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,799
signing which is in iusb is with the isb

47
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,280
um and still has an update for us

48
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,799
we have two existing milestone items ups

49
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,479
delegation which frederick's going to

50
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,720
give an update on um i know there's been

51
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,480
some discussion on the list i'm happy to

52
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,680
see that you know we're making some

53
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,879
progress there

54
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,640
and then here is going to talk about the

55
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,800
triggers interface

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,599
um

57
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,800
here is our agenda um we got two hours

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,400
this time because we did run out of time

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,520
last time

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,040
uh so

61
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,640
hopefully everyone will have plenty of

62
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,440
opportunity to ask questions and

63
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,640
discuss

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,120
but we do have a fact agenda so

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,360
if anyone has any

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,040
changes they'd like to make or voice

67
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,440
please do so now otherwise we will move

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,720
on no

69
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,840
okay

70
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,800
then the first thing on the agenda is we

71
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,879
had a call for adoption on

72
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,040
two draft i've been out after the last

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,560
night yeah

74
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,879
um we just wanted to go over that

75
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,959
um here they are

76
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,519
the first one is the stevian eye

77
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,920
triggers extension draft

78
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,720
just as a recap there was originally a

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,959
draft done by ori

80
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,239
that we adopted back in ipf 103 we then

81
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,040
made some decisions earlier this year to

82
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,680
change it to be a full update of the

83
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,319
existing graph just because it

84
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,080
seems like it was easier to understand

85
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
rather than as just a separate set of

86
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,360
extensions

87
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,400
um

88
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,640
sorry

89
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,159
um

90
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,840
and so there were no objections on the

91
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,879
list there were some people who

92
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,760
expressed you know their their approval

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,879
of this and so we are

94
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,480
we are ready to move forward with

95
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,519
adoption

96
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,400
um

97
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,720
we're just giving folks the last

98
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,200
uh chance here to object otherwise we

99
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,879
will move forward with the

100
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,120
wrath

101
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,040
uh

102
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,599
i don't see anyone stepping up to object

103
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,120
so i i think this one's pretty

104
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,799
straightforward um the existing

105
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,519
milestone is set for december of this

106
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,319
year

107
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,840
uh i don't know if that's still a

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,680
reasonable deadline here if you think

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,080
that we should extend that and i think

110
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,238
maybe updating that milestone

111
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,000
to you know what is a reasonable time

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,320
frame to get that finished up

113
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,000
do you think we can get it done by ief

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,560
113 or

115
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,840
or do you think it's pretty close as is

116
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,880
i think that

117
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,000
we should

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,520
be able to

119
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,400
get done with the marriage but by the

120
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,040
itf

121
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,240
113 but i also suggest further work on

122
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,040
this

123
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,400
on this draft

124
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,400
so this might take longer

125
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,800
okay

126
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,560
i'd like to set a deadline just because

127
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,400
deadlines are good for us it's good for

128
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,040
us to have deadlines um i i don't want

129
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,199
us to rush to get it in by obviously

130
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,280
next month but i think you know

131
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
if we feel good about trying to shoot

132
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,800
for march of 2022 i would be

133
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,960
good

134
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,039
all right

135
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,720
and then the other draft was the

136
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,120
footprint extension

137
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,039
again this is just additions to the

138
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,919
metadata footprint registry um

139
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,160
by design we built a registry so that we

140
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,840
could add stuff as we move forward and

141
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,440
found things that we needed and i think

142
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,720
this is a great example of that um the

143
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,320
changes are fairly straightforward there

144
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,160
were no objections on the list

145
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,039
um and there were you know there was

146
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,440
support board on the list um if anyone

147
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,039
has any objections to it this is your

148
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,479
last chance before we call the adoption

149
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
um i'd like to go ahead and just add a

150
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,479
milestone for this and i think this

151
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,840
one's pretty straightforward i think we

152
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,039
should be able to get it done by the

153
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,520
next ietf do you see any issues with

154
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,319
that setting a deadline of march for

155
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,560
this as well

156
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
for let's call or

157
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,080
um for for trying to finish it up yeah

158
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,000
and trying to get to a last call by my

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,960
next

160
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,240
idea

161
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,919
okay

162
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,120
um

163
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,479
i don't think there's a lot more to add

164
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,080
to this one this one's pretty

165
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,280
straightforward

166
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,840
um yeah i think so we should be able to

167
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,840
have that you know wrapped up by end of

168
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,000
march i mean by by the idea of 113.

169
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,680
or any less discussion topics we can

170
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,440
talk about in march and then you know

171
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,960
push that out if we need to

172
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,800
but i encourage everyone to go please

173
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,120
read these drafts add any comments you

174
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,000
have to the list and we will try and

175
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,960
wrap these up quickly

176
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,840
all right

177
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,440
so then i am going to

178
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,240
load up near slides so that he can go

179
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,520
ahead and talk about these two drafts

180
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,440
and here please take it away

181
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,319
thank you

182
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,039
thank you so uh

183
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,599
as they came in already

184
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,199
explained in the preview in itf 101

185
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,400
uh

186
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,039
i will propose to have assist for

187
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,160
adoption

188
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,199
and the first one is

189
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,880
is heading can you please

190
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
yeah okay

191
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,560
so i'll cover both of them and give a

192
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
quick recap and and open it for

193
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,840
questions

194
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,039
so the first uh

195
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,120
draft is extending the foot in the copy

196
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
footprint capabilities capability

197
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
interfaced with additional footprint

198
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,479
types

199
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,720
um next place

200
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,919
so a quick recap of of the current state

201
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:54,960
currently

202
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,680
rfc 806 defines the footwind types

203
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,280
which can be ipv4 ipv6 asn and country

204
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,840
code counter code specifically is an iso

205
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,120
3166 code

206
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,080
to alphanumeric to alphanumeric

207
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,599
characters

208
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,680
and it's further to discard the footwork

209
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,560
object as you can see in the example a

210
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
footwork object is built

211
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,400
of a footman type

212
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,440
and between values okay so in this

213
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,720
example the footing type is ipv4

214
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,840
and the values uh a client matching this

215
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,200
footprint object

216
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,760
as one of the is belongs to one of the

217
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,958
subnets in the list

218
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,080
next please

219
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,119
uh ifc808

220
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,519
which is the foot foot the fdi into the

221
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,320
sci put in capability interface

222
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,399
uses this footprint

223
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,519
objects

224
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,399
and in order to specify which capability

225
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,920
the availability of capabilities for

226
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,360
specific clients

227
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,279
so in this example the client they

228
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,760
capability specified capability

229
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,600
is available for clients within the asn

230
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,680
64496

231
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,279
that resides in the u.s

232
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,880
and so

233
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,240
the first

234
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,640
footprint type we would like to add

235
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,240
is a

236
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,640
practically a next step for the country

237
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,680
code

238
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,519
taking it one

239
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,200
level down

240
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,600
geographically level uh

241
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,240
so geographically wise

242
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,200
uh

243
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,000
so if israel 316

244
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
if the country code relates to the

245
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,640
united states or to country

246
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,800
the subdivision codes

247
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,880
relates to states

248
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,320
in the u.s or province in canada

249
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,160
and

250
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
so each the

251
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,440
iso 31662

252
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,360
defines a

253
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,959
three alpha

254
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,399
a

255
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,040
alpha alpha characters

256
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,720
subdivision codes

257
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,040
and we would like to use them in order

258
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,120
to

259
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,680
get a better granularity of the food

260
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,079
with objects

261
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,839
in the below example

262
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,200
you can see a

263
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,959
footed object

264
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,440
and matching the state of new york

265
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,120
within the u.s

266
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,680
as well as the state of new jersey in

267
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,920
the u.s

268
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,439
okay any questions so far

269
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,399
okay

270
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,519
the next

271
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,560
footman type we would like to add is

272
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,440
that the future footwind union

273
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,320
and

274
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,519
i discussed it

275
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,320
in the previous idea the current the

276
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,399
current semantic

277
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,720
of the a photon capability api

278
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,880
says that the list of footprint objects

279
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,480
is a as a narrowing semantics

280
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,320
and we would like to have

281
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,200
some

282
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,920
additive semantics for exam if we want

283
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,360
in the a

284
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,680
part of the footprint definition

285
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,279
marked in red

286
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,079
we define we try to define

287
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,360
a clients residing in the us

288
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,200
or residing in a canada

289
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,519
province of nova scotia

290
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,480
okay so we it allows us to take two

291
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,320
different footprint types

292
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,240
and merging them into

293
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,839
a

294
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,480
large footprint object in

295
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,959
addition additive way

296
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,760
not knowing way

297
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,319
um

298
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,480
i think this is

299
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,200
all we added in the

300
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,680
in the uh

301
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,880
in this draft there was only one change

302
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,760
since the previous itf summit

303
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,560
meeting which changes the footage name

304
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,880
from

305
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,160
3116 to code to subdivision code

306
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,399
following a

307
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,480
single frozen alfonso a remark

308
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,600
um

309
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,120
any questions

310
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,279
concern or something like that

311
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,800
regardless those

312
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,519
suggestions

313
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,079
okay

314
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,680
so let's move on

315
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,880
a

316
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,480
the second draft

317
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,120
was dealing with the the cdni control

318
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,320
interface

319
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,639
uh second edition

320
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,959
um

321
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,800
so as a reminder the

322
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,160
rfc8007 defines the cdn control

323
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,920
interface which allows an obsidian to

324
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
manipulate manage

325
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,639
the

326
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,040
content and metadata held by the dance

327
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,040
obsidian

328
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,600
for example preposition invalidation or

329
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,120
purge

330
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,959
and as kevin already mentioned oe and

331
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,279
sanjay worked on a draft

332
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,959
um

333
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,920
that

334
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,360
that extends

335
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,720
this rfc and the current and currently

336
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,720
we want the then um and we decided to

337
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,839
that it would make sense to merge

338
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,959
uh all the the extension into

339
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,760
the original rfc and create a new rfc

340
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,519
with

341
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,160
a new korean rfc

342
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,440
and which will allow us to also obsolete

343
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,560
rfco 807

344
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,160
and

345
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,199
there is

346
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,959
in this in currently in the draft there

347
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,279
is no new content beyond

348
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,000
the

349
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,320
content already approved by this walking

350
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,519
group

351
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,480
so

352
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,160
what what is there

353
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,760
what we like would like to add

354
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,839
and

355
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,399
explicit and the first added

356
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,839
functionality is the ability to extend

357
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,160
it to

358
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,600
this extent stability extensibility okay

359
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,720
currently

360
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,040
the rfc807

361
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,360
the trigger of the trigger object it has

362
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
a closed set of

363
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,720
properties

364
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,360
and there is no way to define

365
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,399
a fine control on that over the trigger

366
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,600
execution

367
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,720
such as a a time for the trigger to be

368
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,480
executed or a specific location for a

369
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,320
through execution

370
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,079
and the

371
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,680
draft suggests the

372
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,880
new generic extensions mechanism for

373
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,480
this trigger

374
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,000
for that video

375
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,240
and the trigger should the trigger

376
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,000
object the version 2 of the trigger

377
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,720
object will have a can have a list

378
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,680
of generic extensions similar to the

379
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,240
generic metadata

380
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,120
from the rfc806

381
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,839
and for example for an example for such

382
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,920
a generic extension is the time

383
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,880
extensions extension allowing the

384
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,160
absence at the end to indicate that a

385
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,720
concentric position should happen at 3

386
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,760
a.m

387
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,480
buenos aires

388
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,320
okay i'm

389
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,399
up i'm not watching it so

390
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,800
if there any if there is any question

391
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,000
regarding

392
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,320
it's good please stop me whenever you

393
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,639
want

394
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,399
okay let's proceed

395
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,040
and the second other functionality is

396
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,519
their propagation

397
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,600
and

398
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,199
in the case that they we have

399
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,800
multiple levels

400
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,959
of

401
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,720
of cdn

402
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,639
so that the trigger from the opposite

403
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,399
end propagates

404
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,560
through the down sedan to a further down

405
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,320
since then

406
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,680
and

407
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,800
we the asked the situation that the

408
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,399
failure happens

409
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,279
uh i think the trigger the failure in

410
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,440
the trigger execution happens

411
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,240
uh within the further downs and down

412
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,440
sedan

413
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,560
and the

414
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,800
um

415
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,120
draft allows a mechanism

416
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,880
so there's a mechanism that allows the

417
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,639
dams incident

418
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,600
to

419
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,800
indicate

420
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,160
that the

421
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,000
failure happened within

422
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,839
the funded the food adults would see the

423
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,800
end if it if it desire to it just had

424
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,880
add the cdn id

425
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,720
to the a l object

426
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,000
okay

427
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,240
next

428
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,120
and the last and actually

429
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,560
most simple uh addition to the rfc to

430
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,800
the draft

431
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,440
is the uh additional content selection

432
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,560
methods okay so the original rfc has a

433
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,199
set of properties that allows the

434
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,079
selection of metadata or content

435
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,880
urls or patterns

436
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,760
and the draft suggests to

437
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,400
the selection of content contact via

438
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,240
regixes

439
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,640
as well as playlists for example

440
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,880
hls

441
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,240
or dash

442
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,799
okay and in order to support that we

443
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,079
need to extend both the trigger object

444
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,600
and so we have a

445
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,200
version two of it and the object

446
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,400
um

447
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,840
okay so

448
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,720
that that's all for the adoption stage

449
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,600
so

450
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,880
it would be a good time to point to stop

451
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,919
okay

452
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,520
and have a questions or any

453
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,919
so all of that is

454
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,080
what was already in there that was

455
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,280
available

456
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,799
in the existing room

457
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,400
yeah

458
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
everything there was

459
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,960
everything i i mentioned so far

460
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,240
it was already

461
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,039
a

462
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,000
discussed in the original duff that was

463
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,520
adapted

464
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,160
adopted by this working group

465
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,320
and

466
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,240
we just want to

467
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,600
[Music]

468
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,120
we just merge it into the original rfc

469
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,080
okay

470
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,080
yeah so folks should go and if you

471
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,000
haven't read it read it if you have

472
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,160
comments obviously comment

473
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,080
i think near though you wanted to

474
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,120
propose some additional stuff

475
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,039
to add to it

476
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,240
um

477
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,039
so to following the

478
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,799
adoption of the

479
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,320
rfc

480
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,480
uh i would like to make an india i would

481
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,600
like to suggest an additional change

482
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
as i already said

483
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,840
when

484
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,799
a then as you can as you can see in the

485
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,480
left side of the slide

486
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,600
a trigger object has a list of a closed

487
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,400
list of properties allowing the content

488
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,720
or metadata selection

489
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,440
and we now add it to a new content

490
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,120
selection method which is the content

491
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,720
reg access and coded playlists

492
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,400
and

493
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,280
and in order to do that we must define

494
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
we define the trigger object and create

495
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,679
a version two of it or as well as the

496
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,200
error object

497
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,160
and it

498
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,280
i i think that it would be better to go

499
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,640
to a

500
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,440
a generic mechanism that a new method

501
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,480
for selection for selecting a

502
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,240
new content for

503
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,720
for prepositioning for example

504
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,360
would be done

505
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,600
when we would like to define a new

506
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,840
method for content selection we just do

507
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,160
it by registration

508
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,960
as we do now with the footprint object

509
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,039
that we just registered

510
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,679
so i would like to suggest that the

511
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,120
trigger v2

512
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,720
object will have a actually at least an

513
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,000
objects list

514
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,679
of generic trigger objects

515
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,480
that can be any one of those

516
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,919
uh

517
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,400
of this of this

518
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,480
option metadata urls or content urls etc

519
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,200
and we will maintain a registry

520
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,120
for this

521
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,320
content selection methods

522
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,200
we had it was um

523
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,720
there was an email on the list about

524
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,799
this if i recall and you and i had a

525
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,400
discussion about this

526
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,600
um

527
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,159
i think it makes sense to me but as an

528
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,840
author of the metadata draft and

529
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,440
uh data makes sense and the use of a

530
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,720
generic trigger x trigger object

531
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,799
makes sense to me i think it's cleaner

532
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,600
than having to keep enumerating things

533
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,679
as properties inside the

534
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,080
trigger object

535
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,720
so i i like the idea personally

536
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,960
i don't know if anyone else wants to

537
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,280
step up to the mic and

538
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,840
put out an opinion

539
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,640
i think it does make for a cleaner

540
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,760
object and um do we have a draft with

541
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,880
proposed changes for that out or

542
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,520
not yet i didn't want to

543
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,240
make too noise with that before we have

544
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,919
the adoption

545
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,919
okay

546
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:40,720
um

547
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,720
i think it's an interesting idea i think

548
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,960
i like the idea if anyone else has

549
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,200
thoughts on it um you know please speak

550
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,400
up or

551
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,280
we can i think move forward with

552
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,679
the adoption piece so go ahead and push

553
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,360
the

554
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,520
the updated drafts as working group

555
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,480
drafts

556
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,919
and then

557
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,480
we can push out an additional update

558
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,600
with proposals and start discussing this

559
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,000
additional change on top of that

560
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,440
is that what you were thinking laura

561
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,839
[Music]

562
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,159
okay

563
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,080
i think that's a good plan

564
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,039
uh

565
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,960
i'll stop here again and pause to see if

566
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,520
anybody else wants to

567
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,320
voice an opinion

568
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,879
i think that means everyone agrees

569
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,360
okay i didn't i didn't hear any

570
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,880
objections either

571
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,200
there are no objections um

572
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,039
i think it's easier it's easier to

573
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,799
discuss once we have some text in front

574
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,679
of us so i'm happy to let's let's put

575
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,840
out the the working group draft and then

576
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,559
propose an update and and discuss it on

577
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,879
the list

578
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,400
oh i see there's a comment

579
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400

580
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400

586
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,320
uri signing

587
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,799
how's it going everybody

588
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
um all right so

589
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,600
a quick rehash of some things that

590
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,760
happened that we went over uh in the

591
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,240
summer ietf session

592
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,279
it was in last call in february

593
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,679
i did post a new revision

594
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,120
right before the the draft dead period

595
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,360
kevin already reviewed it

596
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,279
gave some feedback as did chris

597
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,640
appreciate that

598
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,720
i've already merged those changes

599
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,159
except for one we'll talk about that a

600
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,919
little bit

601
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,679
so

602
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,159
back to the the feedback that we got in

603
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,320
the last call in february

604
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,480
i addressed

605
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,159
all the easy things

606
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,400
but there were a couple things that

607
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,880
i don't think were so easy so

608
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,640
um client ip

609
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,159
there were usefulness and privacy

610
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,000
concerns honestly i think they were

611
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,679
mostly usefulness

612
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,240
um like how does this operate when

613
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,760
you're dealing with dual stacked how

614
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,200
does this operate when you're dealing

615
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,960
with mptcp

616
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,400
how does this operate when you're

617
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,559
dealing with switching from wi-fi to

618
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,919
mobile all the all the cases that that

619
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,360
were aware of it wasn't like any

620
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,000
shockers were in there but um it was

621
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,240
just

622
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,360
they felt that either it wasn't

623
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,640
um

624
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,279
talked about enough or maybe its

625
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,039
usefulness is so small that we should

626
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,320
just remove it

627
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,679
um

628
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,200
shared keys

629
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,320
that one was a really big one

630
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,960
we didn't i added some more text to say

631
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,279
hey this is a really bad idea you really

632
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,200
shouldn't do this but if you want to

633
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,640
here's how you do it and it's supported

634
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,320
there were some things that i changed

635
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,279
from uh should to must

636
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,600
because i had no good reason why

637
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,240
it

638
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,840
it shouldn't be must

639
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,039
um

640
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,320
and then

641
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,080
there's there's always been an agging

642
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,159
question of more advice for designated

643
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,919
experts

644
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,080
i i've

645
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,679
put some stuff in there but i really

646
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,279
don't know what more to put and if

647
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,919
anybody has good examples of this

648
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,000
i'd love to have that i am going to

649
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,679
email all the ads especially the ones

650
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,120
that talked about that and ask for

651
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,240
specific examples because i'm i'm kind

652
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,520
of out of ideas for that one

653
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,520
so i have a couple questions that i want

654
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,799
to put forth

655
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,400
um

656
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,760
and i i

657
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,279
was thinking about this as as the

658
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,400
meeting was starting up that i probably

659
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,440
should have done this on the mailing

660
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,679
list first too but i will follow up with

661
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,559
that

662
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,279
um should we remove client ip

663
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,159
um

664
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,240
the reason why it was put in there was

665
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,440
because

666
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,679
um it was traditionally in there in the

667
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,840
proprietary implementations

668
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,400
um so people wanted it people used it

669
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,320
people like to be able to say

670
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,919
uh hey here let me give you a quick

671
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,240
preview link what's your ip

672
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,480
and you know people would know that

673
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,400
it needed to be their cable modem ip and

674
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,320
if they changed anything it would fail

675
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,760
that sort of thing like that was the use

676
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,039
case it wasn't really meant to be a

677
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,919
robust option that would be used for the

678
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,120
general case

679
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,240
um

680
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,039
but

681
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,559
maybe it's just not useful and we should

682
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,720
remove it rather than trying to write a

683
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,080
bunch of text around why people

684
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,840
shouldn't use it

685
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,960
um

686
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,000
second question is removing shared keys

687
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,760
uh uh should do we want to stop there's

688
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,440
people in the queue i can answer if

689
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,720
people want to comment about that first

690
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,080
question

691
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,200
yeah let's let's

692
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,240
go ahead i think

693
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,279
why don't you

694
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,320
go ahead andrew

695
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,480
to your point about the client ips like

696
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,400
yeah there are a lot of caveats a lot of

697
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,320
risks i mean i've been personally bitten

698
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,559
between clients switching on dual stack

699
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,159
between v4 v6 with certain

700
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,360
vendors but

701
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,159
unless there's a large overhead in

702
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,480
keeping it in i feel like keeping it in

703
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,919
is probably the best bet it's going to

704
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,320
add flexibility and use cases where like

705
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,080
you mentioned there could be

706
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,440
very niche

707
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,120
uri signing that folks are going to want

708
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,880
to do maybe even internally within

709
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,320
organizations

710
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,120
you know so on and so forth um

711
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,440
i it unless there's a

712
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,679
risk in keeping it i think keeping it is

713
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,320
probably the better way to go

714
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,520
with the understanding that you

715
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,600
mentioned there's there's caveats and

716
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,559
it's

717
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,559
i think just a general disclaimer that

718
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,120
you know there are caveats with how this

719
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,960
works and it's up to you to accept all

720
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,640
those caveats if you implement this

721
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,399
okay that's that's very helpful uh i so

722
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,480
um real quick before kevin speaks um

723
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,159
i i so i'm going to send these to the

724
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,399
mailing list it would be awesome

725
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,720
uh andrew if you could kind of reiterate

726
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,159
that on the mailing list because i want

727
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:15,039
to use that to point the the ads to

728
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,880
about their concerns and i'll i'll make

729
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,919
sure that i

730
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,399
uh make the the text robust enough if

731
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,000
it's not already i already added some

732
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,240
stuff to it but i might want to just

733
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,279
um

734
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,640
polish it up a little bit and really

735
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,559
kind of drive home that point that that

736
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,520
these are

737
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,520
like you said niche use cases that it's

738
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,158
there to support

739
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,640
yeah i'll throw in my two cents as an

740
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,039
individual i think that you know we had

741
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,120
always talked about the

742
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,159
internal use private network kind of i

743
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,559
own i'm in isp i own it i want to use an

744
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,279
ip address for a specific purpose and

745
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,799
that's the only place it's really good

746
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,039
for i mean uri signing has a lot of

747
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,640
questionable security things in there

748
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,039
right we all know that

749
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,039
we could certainly beef up the

750
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,760
disclaimers about it um i saw that you

751
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,520
added one i mean because we can make it

752
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,159
even more you know

753
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,120
obvious to folks how bad it is but

754
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,159
i think

755
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,640
if there are people who need it and that

756
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,520
was

757
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,200
the original rationale right there is a

758
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,360
vendor who wanted this and so

759
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,279
uh i don't necessarily see a reason to

760
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,440
pull it unless there's a lot of pushback

761
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,919
i don't know how bad the pushback was

762
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,600
but

763
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,200
um we could probably put bigger

764
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,520
folder things in there about why you

765
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,360
shouldn't use it or and also where the

766
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,760
one or two good use cases are for using

767
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,600
this um you know

768
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,360
which helps the the reader understand

769
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,399
why we're keeping it in

770
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,880
okay

771
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,840
chris chris

772
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,480
i i won't uh rehash all of that i agree

773
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,679
with the previous commenters there's

774
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,760
there's lots of desire for this

775
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,480
uh the one thing i wanted to add was

776
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,080
there are

777
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,399
um

778
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,480
there are some situations where

779
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,360
you know the set of ip addresses that it

780
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,880
could be coming in from

781
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,919
and the client ip field could actually

782
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,480
be more useful if we made it into an

783
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,080
array

784
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,080
i hesitate to suggest enhancements at

785
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,480
this point but it is a fairly simple one

786
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,120
yeah that

787
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,640
so i was actually thinking about that

788
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,480
when i was going through

789
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,120
going through this again um

790
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,960
like we we could do a lot of things we

791
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,880
could probably add like

792
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,000
a v4 and a v6 client ip and do some

793
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,880
other stuff um

794
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,399
i also agree with

795
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,399
doing changes this late in the game

796
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,080
um unless

797
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,919
people really felt like hey i have a use

798
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,919
case for that i would kind of want to

799
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,240
say maybe we should leave that to

800
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,760
somebody who has a use case for it to

801
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,120
write an extension in the future

802
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,600
but if if if there's a use case for it

803
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,799
like where you're like hey i would

804
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,360
really like to do this specific thing

805
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,039
and i and i want to do it it's not

806
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,240
theoretical

807
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,159
i i would consider

808
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,240
changing it but i i

809
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,840
again emphasize i really don't want to

810
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,480
if we don't have to

811
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,640
there there is actually a real use case

812
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,279
around wanting to put in both an ipv4

813
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,120
and an ipv6

814
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,080
um

815
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,000
and there are some cases where both

816
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,840
addresses will be known at the time the

817
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,559
u the token is generated

818
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,519
um

819
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,559
and and that can be reasonably reliably

820
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,840
produced

821
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,200
um

822
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,480
uh

823
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,320
likewise there are a couple of use cases

824
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,840
around a token

825
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,360
that could be used by a small collection

826
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,200
of systems

827
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,799
and right now you could put in a cider

828
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,279
which is kind of what we what we picture

829
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,679
for that

830
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,000
i i just think the simplest solution is

831
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,679
to not overthink it and to turn it into

832
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:04,799
an array

833
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,240
but

834
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,000
again

835
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,519
it can go either way i think there's a

836
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,720
marginal feature to start with

837
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,240
okay i think that we have

838
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,039
been in we have been an ie

839
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,399
tf last call for a very long time um

840
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,080
if we were going to make those types of

841
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,120
changes

842
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,880
this is something we would have to go

843
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,600
and pull it and do a new round on

844
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,200
um

845
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,960
i'm all for it if somebody really needs

846
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,720
this right if people are going to say

847
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,799
this draft is not useful to me because i

848
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,640
need the feature then we should be in

849
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,960
the future

850
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,840
agreed

851
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,360
okay

852
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,840
glenn had a comment as well in the chat

853
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,919
disclaimer and then my question about

854
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,919
common access token

855
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,200
i'm not familiar with that project

856
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,919
okay so yeah comment on the client ip

857
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,840
should stay with with a big warning

858
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,200
that's fair

859
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,120
um coordinate your eyes signing

860
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,039
specification common access token

861
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,000
project i'm i'm not familiar with that

862
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,159
so

863
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,600
de facto no but

864
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,000
we could talk about it i don't know i

865
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,360
don't i don't under

866
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,840
i don't really have a sense of what

867
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,159
that looks like and what that might mean

868
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:42,960
for

869
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,080
delaying

870
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,039
uri signing more so i don't want

871
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,559
to promise anything but i was not aware

872
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,120
of that before

873
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,000
yeah i don't know if it's if it's close

874
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,440
if it's close it's something we could

875
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,919
think about if it's not close then

876
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,039
um glenn i know you had uh aws signature

877
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,799
four in your draft

878
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,720
and i and i've been thinking about that

879
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
as well it's not close enough for us to

880
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,760
you know

881
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,760
merge or do anything with i don't think

882
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,800
but

883
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,909
[Music]

884
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,918
okay okay you have another question

885
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,399
yes so so very similar to removing

886
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,639
client ip is removing shared keys and i

887
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,280
kind of have the same feelings on it

888
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,839
that it was created

889
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,359
to do niche tests and stuff like that

890
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,199
i did add some text about hey really

891
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,639
don't do this this is not a good

892
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,000
architecture there's a lot of problems

893
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,280
with it

894
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,800
especially when you're dealing with

895
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,679
tiered cdns and stuff but

896
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,440
i kind of feel like we should keep it

897
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,440
but maybe it's just something where

898
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,199
you know

899
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,079
there

900
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,480
there was a line drawn in the sand

901
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,560
at the ietf saying hey we're not going

902
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,320
to do things like this anymore at all

903
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,079
ever no matter how

904
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,920
valuable or useful they are because they

905
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,839
are bad so

906
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,640
before i went and argued it i wanted to

907
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,280
again ask should we remove the shared

908
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,839
key support

909
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,240
so kevin

910
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,079
i remember why we put in the shared keys

911
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,599
because at the time we started writing

912
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,400
this all of the implementation with um

913
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,280
public cdns had shared keys and so right

914
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,000
it's a thing that we wanted to support

915
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,480
because that's what everybody was doing

916
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,720
um i don't know if that's still the case

917
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,040
i imagine it probably is still supported

918
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,560
and there are probably people who would

919
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,400
like to have it because

920
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,320
you know their legacy systems use it but

921
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,760
it's

922
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,280
it's a

923
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,280
yeah it's not a good idea we could put

924
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,680
you know big disclaimer text again

925
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,599
but

926
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,599
put even bigger disclaimers text saying

927
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,760
that it's even a more marginal value

928
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,520
than the client ip please really don't

929
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,280
use this unless you have no other option

930
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,760
again the yeah

931
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,880
yeah

932
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,800
um but there they're going to be people

933
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,720
who argue i have my own i own the

934
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,960
network and this is easy and we already

935
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,800
do it today so why should i have to

936
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,680
change it then i can't use respect

937
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,119
i don't want to leave those people out

938
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,720
but

939
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,599
maybe we should force them before i

940
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,839
i'm okay with leaving it but

941
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,400
there's an argument there

942
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,320
yeah

943
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,640
chris

944
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,599
uh i think that if you own the network

945
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,960
and you don't have to interoperate with

946
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,400
anybody you don't need a standard to

947
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,920
tell you how to interoperate with people

948
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,440
fair point

949
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,359
so so

950
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,000
is what you're saying that we could

951
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,880
remove explicit shared key support and

952
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,000
then just say something like

953
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,480
if an operator internally wanted to to

954
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,960
do that themselves that would be on them

955
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,000
but we're not giving examples or

956
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,680
ways to do it in this document that kind

957
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,200
of thing like something in security

958
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,720
concerns

959
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,640
i mean you could like you you could

960
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,440
reasonably just remove it um

961
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,720
entirely

962
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,520
uh we don't have a police force we can't

963
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,079
stop people from using shared keys it's

964
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,000
pretty obvious how you would use shared

965
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,200
keys

966
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,520
um

967
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,400
if you wanted to

968
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,560
yeah that's that's a good point i think

969
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,320
maybe we could we could do something

970
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,680
like that where we just

971
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,440
remove it i kind of i kind of still want

972
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,200
to have like a sentence or two about it

973
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
maybe in the security concerns

974
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,880
like historically people have used

975
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,640
shared keys this draft does not address

976
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,960
using shared keys

977
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,000
please consider not using shared keys

978
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,760
if you if you were thinking about it

979
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,440
type of thing because i think i think it

980
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,880
still needs to be addressed but then we

981
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,400
just remove all the examples and

982
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,119
discussion about it

983
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,839
yeah i i think that that's probably wise

984
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,079
okay i agree we should we should state

985
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,000
explicitly that we're not

986
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,359
doing it right yeah because it was in

987
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,000
previous versions

988
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,839
uh okay and the last question um this

989
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,079
was only brought up by 180 but he he

990
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,599
brought it up multiple times and he said

991
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,040
he really doesn't understand how this

992
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,680
draft works if uh

993
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,119
the cdni uri container is not mandatory

994
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,599
um and now my understanding of why we

995
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,359
chose to do that is essentially

996
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,440
um and this is gonna probably be even

997
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,000
more scary than share keys is is if we

998
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,760
wanted to give somebody a skeleton key

999
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,000
like here this token works for anything

1000
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,280
or works for anything for a certain

1001
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,960
amount of time like it doesn't matter

1002
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,280
what the uri is but he makes a good

1003
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,880
point like

1004
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,920
that that seems he made it in a way of

1005
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,960
um

1006
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,240
i don't understand how this would even

1007
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,000
work but

1008
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,599
when i was thinking about the argument

1009
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,480
to it

1010
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,720
and all the discussion on client ip and

1011
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,720
shared keys i was like yeah skeleton key

1012
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,839
is probably kind of a sketchy argument

1013
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,640
but

1014
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,400
is that something that people need does

1015
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,160
somebody need to just say look i don't

1016
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,320
want to keep getting a new updated token

1017
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,320
for my internal use case much like

1018
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,960
client ip

1019
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,880
let's just leave it in there but put

1020
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,880
something like you really really should

1021
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,320
put something in here if you're giving

1022
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,400
it up to anybody outside of whatever

1023
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,680
because

1024
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,839
you know

1025
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,839
me or maybe something like you probably

1026
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,839
want to put client ip in here if you're

1027
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,119
not using

1028
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,119
uri container i i really don't want to

1029
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,920
get into like a matrix of so you should

1030
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,160
have this if you don't this or this you

1031
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,680
know that kind of combination of

1032
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,480
claims in there but maybe we should

1033
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,160
i i kind of feel maybe we should keep it

1034
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,839
with some more text saying

1035
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,440
if you're not using this

1036
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,119
you're leaving yourself open so maybe

1037
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,880
you should have client id or a very

1038
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,880
short expiry time or something else to

1039
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,440
compensate

1040
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,520
i'm having some light issues is anybody

1041
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,599
also hearing some of the the noise on

1042
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,400
the there's some static um

1043
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
i don't know if it's coming from from

1044
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,720
their film or

1045
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,720
i can switch headphones i've been i've

1046
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,879
been

1047
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,760
you came prepared

1048
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,760
can you hear us

1049
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,680
does that make it does that make it any

1050
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,640
better

1051
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,400
yes a lot better

1052
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,839
oh sorry apologize to everybody

1053
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,319
then that's mine

1054
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,879
so uh chris do you want how to comment

1055
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,480
yeah so

1056
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,760
there is a use case with no cd and i you

1057
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,520
um

1058
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,920
if your cdn is accepting keys from

1059
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,119
um multiple uh issuers

1060
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,599
you are likely to pro you are likely to

1061
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,680
in fact you are going to have to have a

1062
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,319
limitation where you only it's where you

1063
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,560
have an association between

1064
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,160
what uh

1065
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,240
uh what systems you accept that key for

1066
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,440
um or

1067
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,560
that key

1068
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,160
if you're willing to accept that an

1069
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,240
issuer can authorize a given uri

1070
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,400
in general then you have to be willing

1071
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,839
to allow an issuer to authorize any uri

1072
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,040
so there's no reason to

1073
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,280
they can just put dot splat in the cd

1074
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,280
and i you see right

1075
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,040
there's no reason to force them to put

1076
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,800
dot splat in there

1077
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,720
um if they can just eliminate it

1078
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,400
um it's just a waste of a regex um

1079
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,319
compilation and execution

1080
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:54,880
okay

1081
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,000
um

1082
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,400
yeah i i'm i'm fine with that

1083
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,319
i so

1084
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,000
like i said before i'm gonna i'm gonna

1085
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,680
send these all out in question as

1086
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,680
questions to the male english too and if

1087
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,880
you can reply because it'll be much

1088
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,160
easier to

1089
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,520
to send them links to a mailing list um

1090
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,319
then

1091
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,920
links to a video somewhere and again

1092
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,520
apologize for not doing that before this

1093
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,400
call

1094
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,880
but yeah okay and if there's no more

1095
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,800
comments i'll move on

1096
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,040
um so the only the thing i don't have on

1097
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,720
this um because it just happened earlier

1098
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,359
this morning is chris updated um sent a

1099
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,720
pr with his

1100
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,880
text for the

1101
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,280
normative reference on the

1102
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,240
path parameters and form parameters

1103
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,640
i didn't merge it already

1104
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,480
just because i

1105
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,720
it was very quick and i wanted to kind

1106
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,880
of give people a chance to to think

1107
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,200
about it and comment on it

1108
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:47,920
and

1109
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,880
and

1110
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,280
you know see if there's any

1111
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,800
anything else people any other feelings

1112
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,040
people have on it

1113
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,960
i guess my

1114
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,280
my first thought on is it seems okay

1115
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,960
so

1116
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,760
um

1117
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,599
also thanks to

1118
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,440
kevin and chris for the other

1119
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,400
um

1120
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,720
review stuff i i've already merged that

1121
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,000
into the

1122
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,680
into the repo so whenever we're after

1123
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,200
i'm done talking to the ads about their

1124
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,319
concerns

1125
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,000
um and make the updates for the shared

1126
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,440
keys i'll do another draft so

1127
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,720
does anybody have any um

1128
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,200
comments on chris's pr had a chance to

1129
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,800
look at it i think he submitted it like

1130
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,920
1am

1131
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,319
my time so i i'm doubting it but figured

1132
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,319
i'd throw it out there before i finish

1133
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,480
up

1134
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,280
i haven't read it yet but i will

1135
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,240
okay all right so uh yeah i guess i'm

1136
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,839
all done then i'll make sure to send

1137
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,200
those emails out to the mailing list so

1138
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,200
people can reply and thank you very much

1139
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,640
i think um

1140
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,520
the other thing is we have i don't know

1141
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,560
um

1142
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,280
if francesca is there we

1143
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,000
we put um review of

1144
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,079
uri signing on

1145
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,960
chat if we have to make these updates um

1146
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,880
is that something that we need to do

1147
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,680
ahead of that for

1148
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,240
francesca did you have a comment

1149
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,040
yes so i as soon as you posted the

1150
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,000
update i added it to the next telescope

1151
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,160
which is uh december the 2nd

1152
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,680
so that's why i put it up directly

1153
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,880
um

1154
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,119
because otherwise he would get filled up

1155
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:31,839
and

1156
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:32,910
he would have to wait

1157
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:34,160
[Applause]

1158
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,359
six weeks instead of four weeks um

1159
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,920
so if if the working group and you feel

1160
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,520
can can make any any um

1161
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,720
additional modification

1162
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,000
let's say

1163
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,319
at the latest like three four days

1164
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,720
before the telechat

1165
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,920
um

1166
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,040
but yeah as soon as possible but but

1167
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,119
let's say one week before the telechat

1168
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,520
that that would that would give the 80's

1169
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,560
enough time to

1170
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,000
to review like

1171
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,560
the stable version let's say

1172
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,280
and

1173
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,359
yeah it might it might not be needed if

1174
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,599
they remove their

1175
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,920
uh their discuss before the telechat we

1176
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,599
don't actually need to go through but i

1177
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,839
just wanted to put it up there so that

1178
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,680
the ads have a deadline and um

1179
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,960
yeah

1180
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,880
like by that by that time they will have

1181
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,599
to

1182
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,280
have reviewed the this version

1183
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,920
okay so we have some open questions

1184
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,920
phil's going to put them out on the list

1185
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,680
everybody's going to respond and we'll

1186
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,440
have that discussion and if we can close

1187
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,760
those out over the next couple of weeks

1188
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,079
then we can we can leave it on the

1189
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,079
on the agenda for the next for the

1190
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,400
december telechat um if it starts

1191
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,480
dragging out then you may need to push

1192
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,440
it out

1193
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,119
yeah and that's fine as well just let me

1194
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,520
know and i will move it to the

1195
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,400
um

1196
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,640
to to another one i don't know two weeks

1197
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,240
later or or more time if needed but

1198
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,560
ideally it would be good to have

1199
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,440
one week or two to know if if we need to

1200
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,960
move it one week before

1201
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,440
before the telechat so

1202
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,720
november 25th or something like that

1203
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,440
because that's when the agenda is set

1204
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,839
okay so we have two weeks to figure this

1205
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,520
out bill

1206
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,680
okay i i'm my goal is to do work on this

1207
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,480
uh

1208
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,160
say you said the 25th which is

1209
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,880
thanksgiving i have that week off and so

1210
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,119
i was planning to do work on it during

1211
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,960
that week so hopefully

1212
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,240
um

1213
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,839
i think that aligns well with what my

1214
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,440
intention was

1215
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,520
okay great

1216
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,520
and again if if not just let me know and

1217
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,359
i can move it no

1218
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,480
like no no no big pressure just um

1219
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,560
yeah just try to make it this the most

1220
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,720

to talk about

1227
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,160
the https delegation

1228
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,720

1231
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,480
um so uh today i will give you a quick

1232
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,800
update and

1233
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,480
draft

1234
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,640
we are on version 7 now

1235
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,359
next slide please

1236
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,640
so in the mailing list we had

1237
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,119
quite many comments

1238
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,440
on the draft

1239
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,640
first we

1240
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,920
split the document into two drafts as

1241
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,559
required by the chair

1242
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,160
in the last

1243
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,680
last cd9 working group session

1244
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,280
so the first

1245
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,960
draft we are talking today is

1246
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,800
strictly about the

1247
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,319
acme star

1248
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,160
delegation methods

1249
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,760
and the other part in the other document

1250
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,680
deals with

1251
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,920
subsets only

1252
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,960
for that

1253
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,440
we will

1254
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,720
have the help of guillaume bishop

1255
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,440
that is not here today i think

1256
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,760
um

1257
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,480
i see him he's there okay okay

1258
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,200
so yum feel free to uh to comment if

1259
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,800
necessary

1260
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,800
uh so

1261
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,640
then we fixed

1262
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,359
a bunch of things in the draft

1263
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,760
we

1264
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,559
changed the

1265
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,079
generic metadata name because we used

1266
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,359
wrong wrong names

1267
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,839
wrong names in the metadata

1268
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,520
in the draft so we

1269
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,119
correct this we collected this

1270
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,240
we removed the periodicity because

1271
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,240
actually we

1272
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,440
do not

1273
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,160
need this anymore

1274
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:18,880
[Music]

1275
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,240
yeah

1276
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,079
we have also

1277
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,599
registered a new fci pedal type

1278
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,079
actually we need to do that once the

1279
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,839
draft is

1280
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:30,880
being

1281
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,480
rfc

1282
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,520
and we added a privacy section

1283
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,599
which needs to be

1284
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,640
guess

1285
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,599
completed a bit

1286
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,079
next slide please

1287
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,359
so

1288
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:51,490
we have still a bunch of things to do

1289
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:52,800
[Music]

1290
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,599
especially on the security and privacy

1291
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,760
parts

1292
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,160
so kevin you

1293
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,359
ask

1294
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:02,800
quite many

1295
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,839
uh questions and we still maybe have to

1296
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,800
add some hints about

1297
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,559
about those so

1298
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,440
i don't know yet uh

1299
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,359
yeah maybe we we will

1300
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,680
discuss about that later

1301
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,680
um

1302
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,680
anyway so

1303
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,640
regarding security and privacy

1304
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,520
we need to be to study a bit

1305
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:33,280
what how to answer that

1306
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:36,079
[Music]

1307
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,040
we also need to fix

1308
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,119
some reference also

1309
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:41,839
the

1310
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,760
need to refer to the rfc

1311
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,720
9115 instead of rfc8739

1312
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,960
we need to remove also the star delegate

1313
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,720
some star delegation

1314
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,200
method properties

1315
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,200
as it is

1316
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,800
mentioned today

1317
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,319
we have the acme star acne server and

1318
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,640
credentials location rai and csr

1319
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,559
template so

1320
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:13,440
this might not be necessary

1321
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,119
to carry between cdns

1322
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,400
uh where however maybe the csr template

1323
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,660
could be in some cases

1324
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,240
[Music]

1325
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,359
needed so this will need to be discussed

1326
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,839
still

1327
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,119
and finally

1328
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,839
we need also

1329
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,520
to sync

1330
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,680
maybe with sva

1331
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,559
working group that is working on

1332
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,680
on the cdna interfaces

1333
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,040
uh notably

1334
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,079
if we need to

1335
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,319
if we need to add some more uh

1336
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,079
properties in the

1337
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,960
in the cdni in the metadata interface

1338
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,319
so that's still to be to be done

1339
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,839
for the next version i guess

1340
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,160
and i think it's

1341
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,879
next like this

1342
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,880
yeah so

1343
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,839
uh

1344
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:14,800
yeah

1345
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,559
if we have done all this maybe we can

1346
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:22,800
ask for a last call but

1347
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,800
i think it's done from my side

1348
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,119
so i i sent some comments to the list

1349
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:33,200
this weekend i read the updated draft i

1350
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,720
think there's still some more work we

1351
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,760
need to do

1352
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,160
um we do need to keep up the

1353
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,119
privacy and security sections and i

1354
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,720
still have a couple of questions about

1355
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,720
the metadata structure and whether we

1356
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,440
need

1357
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,960
the fci

1358
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,880
um

1359
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,520
type but um

1360
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,319
that's

1361
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,319
um you can take a look at the comments

1362
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,160
that i posted

1363
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,000
okay

1364
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:58,960
and then

1365
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,720
i think we're a little premature for a

1366
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,880
working group last call um we can look

1367
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,720
at the next version of the draft um

1368
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,800
hopefully we can iterate over it

1369
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,200
and then you know between now and

1370
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,359
next march

1371
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:14,640
if we can get to a a good place uh we

1372
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,920
could probably think about that before

1373
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,599
the next iepf

1374
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,839
but um but we'll see where we can get

1375
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,359
through that

1376
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,680
okay

1377
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,160
okay good

1378
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,680
um as an individual um i will i i concur

1379
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,319
with kevin on that we need to wait on

1380
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:35,119
the

1381
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,920
working group last call on this draft

1382
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,480
um because of you know the changes that

1383
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,440
need to be made specifically

1384
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,319
um

1385
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,040
the rfc 9115

1386
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,960
does a lot of work

1387
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,280
uh that aligns with what this draft is

1388
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,119
trying to do so i think there needs to

1389
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,400
be a pretty good alignment between

1390
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,920
how the interface

1391
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,040
how the

1392
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,079
downstream cdn will establish

1393
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:03,119
um

1394
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,160
requests with the upstream cdn

1395
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,960
to exchange information for

1396
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,000
um identifying itself as the acme client

1397
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,240
and and talking to the upstream cdn as

1398
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,680
the acme server so i think all of that

1399
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,200
interaction has to be really captured

1400
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,160
well

1401
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,640
uh so i think once we have that in the

1402
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,720
next draft

1403
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,400
it should require it should be it should

1404
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,480
have a you know good review

1405
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,240
and and based on that we should decide

1406
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,119
you know how the draft moves forward

1407
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,119
thanks

1408
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,880
anyone else have any

1409
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,960
comment on on

1410
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,839
the acp delegation

1411
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,599
uh okay um

1412
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:59,839
i'll look forward to seeing the updated

1413
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,160
draft it sounds like the the rfc

1414
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,480
9v115 changes could be significant so

1415
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,200
um once that update is out everyone

1416
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,200
should go and reread

1417
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,559
and make sure

1418
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,440
it looks good to everyone and then we

1419
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,559
can take that one to the list

1420
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,839
all right thanks fred

1421
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,720
up next is

1422
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,760
when to talk about metadata

1423
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,799
this is a big one

1424
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,720
so

1425
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,359
glenn take it away

1426
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,200
is

1427
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,279
glenn are you muted

1428
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,559
no it looks like he's having some

1429
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:15,359
bandwidth issues

1430
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,040
there may be technical difficulties

1431
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,000
glenn are you there

1432
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,839
should we

1433
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,040
go to andrew first

1434
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:59,000
i may if no one else objects

1435
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,240
yeah um why don't we do that um

1436
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,760
andrew let me pull

1437
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,920
andrew's slides and we'll let him go

1438
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,920
first

1439
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,160
all right andrew are you ready

1440
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,839
sorry yes

1441
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:20,240
uh hi um my name's andrew ryan i'm here

1442
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,319
today to discuss

1443
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,720
um some potential extensions mainly to

1444
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,119
uh the fci

1445
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:30,000
to allow

1446
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,880
signaling of capacity capabilities and

1447
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,000
limits

1448
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,720
next slide please

1449
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,359
so this is specifically related to the

1450
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,440
draft that is mentioned here the draft

1451
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,839
ryan's uni capacity insights extensions

1452
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,200
0-1

1453
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,078
next slide please

1454
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,880
and so this

1455
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,359
we discussed this topic briefly at the

1456
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:58,880
last ietf 111 um but the the general

1457
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,400
highlights of what we're trying to

1458
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,160
accomplish here and the reason we're

1459
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,480
going to be who we've proposed to this

1460
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,240
draft is

1461
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,480
we wanted to be able to accommodate the

1462
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,680
ability to

1463
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,880
allow us

1464
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,040
cdns upstream cdn's downstream gyms or

1465
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,960
content providers

1466
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,200
the ability to make informed decisions

1467
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,640
about how much traffic should be

1468
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,640
delegated

1469
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,400
we wanted to provide a vehicle

1470
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,160
um using

1471
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,839
uh cdni

1472
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,720
and particularly the fci interface uh to

1473
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,079
to handle

1474
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,880
this signaling and the goal was to be

1475
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,119
able to make s to signal capacity limits

1476
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,680
that are specific to the delegation

1477
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,280
relationship between

1478
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,520
an upstream and downstream make sure

1479
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,079
that the signaling that's being provided

1480
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,720
is unambiguous and very clearly and

1481
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,200
mutually understood and that there's the

1482
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,839
ability for uh a communication direction

1483
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:52,799
between

1484
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,599
uh the upstream and the downstream uh

1485
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,599
and just a quick call out that the

1486
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,680
actual transport mechanism itself is

1487
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,280
somewhat out of scope of this we're

1488
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,040
merely just talking about and making the

1489
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,440
proposal about the vehicle

1490
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,799
in which the data is going to be

1491
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:08,400
encapsulated with

1492
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,839
i know there's been some discussion

1493
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:11,440
about using alto

1494
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,640
um the specific use case that we hear

1495
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,400
uh in the street and the streaming video

1496
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,319
alliance for the open caching initiative

1497
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:21,119
was we there there's a another api

1498
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:22,960
interface that we'd be leveraging but

1499
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,040
the data model is going to rely heavily

1500
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:25,839
upon

1501
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:27,440
cdni

1502
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,160
next slide please

1503
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,359
so how are we going to accomplish

1504
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,520
everything we've laid out there um

1505
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,520
what we've kind of come up with is that

1506
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,760
we've during discussion we wanted to

1507
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,240
uh leverage fci as much as possible we

1508
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,240
felt this was very appropriate

1509
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,440
uh to act and um

1510
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,480
be you uh be conducted as a capability

1511
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,880
uh how much capacity a downstream is

1512
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,960
advertising to an upstream

1513
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,440
so as such you know we proposed okay

1514
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,359
let's come up with a a payload that um a

1515
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:04,079
downstream could use to advertise

1516
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:06,799
capacity limit capabilities uh the the

1517
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,960
limits would be in units such as you

1518
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,559
know bits per second

1519
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:13,280
um requests per second

1520
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,559
and

1521
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:17,599
the way we were going to tackle the

1522
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,920
um the the compo the goal that i had

1523
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,400
mentioned about um unambiguous and

1524
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,319
mutually understood

1525
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:25,680
uh limits

1526
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,760
is by coupling each one of these

1527
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,400
capacity limits with a corresponding

1528
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,640
telemetry source which gave

1529
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,799
near real-time aggregated metrics about

1530
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:37,200
the usage of an upstream against a

1531
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,400
downstream

1532
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,520
um and so in that way

1533
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,440
if the downstream says this is a limit

1534
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,799
you have you can only send me 100

1535
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:47,119
gigabits per second there's no ambiguity

1536
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:48,640
in what that means because the upstream

1537
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,799
can pull its lump resource provided by

1538
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,480
the downstream to see the

1539
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,040
the current uh delegation utilization

1540
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,440
and then adjust accordingly

1541
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,440
the second component here the fci

1542
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,760
telemetry this

1543
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,880
is kind of

1544
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,960
a result of the

1545
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,400
what we just mentioned how we want to

1546
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,119
couple a telemetry source with a a

1547
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:10,640
capacity limit

1548
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,280
this mechanism here this fci telemetry

1549
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,200
is the ability for a downstream to

1550
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,040
advertise support for

1551
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,319
specific telemetry sources or tend or

1552
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:21,940
types

1553
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:23,680
[Music]

1554
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,599
eventually uh

1555
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,839
we would like to propose and work

1556
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:30,319
towards putting together a draft to

1557
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,119
define a formal telemetry interface in

1558
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:34,240
which

1559
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,119
there's

1560
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:36,640
a well-known transport well-defined

1561
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,640
transport and well-defined format of the

1562
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,599
data that would be uh available for

1563
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,000
near-time aggregated metrics such as

1564
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,559
things like bits for pet requests sorry

1565
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:50,720
bits per second request per second etc

1566
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,200
but in lieu of that what we're we're

1567
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,880
basically going to be doing in the near

1568
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,039
term since a formal

1569
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:58,720
telemetry interface would be a very

1570
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,839
large effort to scope and define we

1571
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:04,160
wanted to leverage in the near term

1572
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,799
just a stub of a generic telemetry

1573
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:07,839
source

1574
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,480
and the goal of that is twofold one the

1575
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,319
level of effort in defining a formal

1576
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:15,039
climate interface and the integration

1577
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,839
but two it's in most cases right now

1578
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:19,839
folks who are actively working on

1579
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:22,240
delegating requests between different

1580
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,319
entities there already are existing

1581
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:27,119
telemetry sources uh so being able to

1582
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,200
leverage already existing telemetry

1583
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,280
sources and all of the work that's done

1584
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,319
there

1585
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:35,680
it this will help um ease of adoption if

1586
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,680
folks start moving towards this model so

1587
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,599
instead of

1588
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,520
adding additional work to integrate in

1589
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,680
that telemetry let's take advantage of

1590
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,839
work that's already been done

1591
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:47,520
so those two are tightly coupled

1592
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,880
together in

1593
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:49,680
how

1594
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,200
the upstream the downstream can talk

1595
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,160
about

1596
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,200
the

1597
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,960
the specific limits the downstream is

1598
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,200
allowing the upstream or

1599
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,760
this this next one the semi capacity

1600
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,079
requested capacity limits element it's a

1601
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:04,319
generic metadata element that we're kind

1602
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:06,640
of using to

1603
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,920
allow a vehicle for the upstream to ask

1604
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,319
the downstream to

1605
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:15,359
reconsider and publish new capacity

1606
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,839
limits so the other in the in the

1607
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:20,240
previous models these fci capabilities

1608
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,520
the upstream would be polling the

1609
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,440
downstream um

1610
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,119
in this model

1611
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:27,280
the the upstream would be able to use

1612
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,559
this metadata object to send a signal to

1613
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,839
the downstream

1614
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,079
uh which would then

1615
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:35,839
trigger an asynchronous process in the

1616
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:37,200
back end which is left up to the

1617
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,880
downstream to

1618
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,760
implement and

1619
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,440
work out all the details on this is

1620
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,480
mainly just a vehicle once again to uh

1621
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,760
facilitate

1622
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,359
the bi-directional communication goal

1623
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,359
that we've been looking for

1624
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:53,119
next slide please

1625
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:54,880
um just one question i think kevin do

1626
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,839
you have a question here

1627
01:03:56,839 --> 01:04:00,400
sure yeah you mentioned um existing

1628
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,559
sources are the majority of these

1629
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,599
sources um proprietary in nature or are

1630
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:08,319
there standard protocols right that

1631
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:09,839
people are using to

1632
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:12,319
currently distribute the data or emit

1633
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:13,599
the data

1634
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:16,160
um that's a very good question it's it's

1635
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,160
i guess a little bit of column a little

1636
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,160
bit of column b right uh typically it's

1637
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,680
going to be a you know some kind of an

1638
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:22,960
http

1639
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,480
https api endpoint in which you know um

1640
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,640
content providers or other cdns are

1641
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,240
pulling a bespoke

1642
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,720
interface provided by a downstream cdn

1643
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,559
which has you know

1644
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,119
provides metrics and the the payload is

1645
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,079
in

1646
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:40,240
a bespoke form you know typically it's

1647
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,680
going to be json or something of that

1648
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:42,799
nature but

1649
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:45,039
there there is no standardization at all

1650
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:47,119
there and that's actually going back

1651
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:48,799
it's to your point

1652
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:50,799
we do eventually want to go and make the

1653
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:53,200
proposal to define

1654
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,280
a telemetry interface

1655
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,440
because of that exact reason there's no

1656
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,440
standardization there's no

1657
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,440
communication channel well defined it's

1658
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,760
all kind of just ad hoc based on which

1659
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,880
provider is involved

1660
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,839
so yes

1661
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,319
so we believe that the data itself is

1662
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:14,799
describable in a generic way because

1663
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:17,760
though the interfaces are proprietary

1664
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,960
the type of information that's being

1665
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,480
provided is

1666
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,240
fairly consistent across different

1667
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,640
vendors or

1668
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,640
yes that was the that was kind of the

1669
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,960
decision point we were looking at and to

1670
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,720
i think one of your other uh feedback

1671
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,799
points um was

1672
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,799
the concept of a are we going to be

1673
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,559
defining a registry

1674
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,359
and the answer to that point was yes for

1675
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:43,839
specific types of telemetry such as bits

1676
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,000
per second request per second

1677
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,559
uh i feel you know there's

1678
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:50,400
a well

1679
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,720
i guess a generally well understood

1680
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,880
concept of what those

1681
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,240
generally mean

1682
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,720
but even still um they're

1683
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,000
kind of getting back to the point of

1684
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,920
tying it to a telemetry source there

1685
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,839
could still be some ambiguity in that

1686
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,599
right if the upstream is calculating

1687
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:07,760
bits per second in a different manner

1688
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,440
particularly if we look at the use case

1689
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,440
of a content provider who may be

1690
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,799
collecting

1691
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:15,839
telemetry from clients directly via rum

1692
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:18,240
they may get a certain calculation of

1693
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,440
usage from that versus tracking uh

1694
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,839
internally from another system uh server

1695
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:25,680
side style metric

1696
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,400
there was there was no clear way at that

1697
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,839
point to

1698
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:33,200
have the upstream calculate on its own

1699
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,680
its usage against the downstream

1700
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,920
uh without incurring some form of

1701
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,400
ambiguity as a result therefore we felt

1702
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,160
that it was more appropriate for the

1703
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,119
downstream to provide a telemetry source

1704
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:48,640
of the usage that it is seeing uh based

1705
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,119
on the delegation and in that manner

1706
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:52,640
when the upstream and the downstream are

1707
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,039
using the same telemetry source to you

1708
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:57,200
to calculate or

1709
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,920
look at utilization the ambiguity is

1710
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,079
then gone and

1711
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:04,799
therefore the both parties involved are

1712
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:07,200
using a unified telemetry source to

1713
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,720
understand the current utilization

1714
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,160
got it right thank you

1715
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,039
um okay uh any other questions at that

1716
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:19,280
point

1717
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,680
all right um so right here what we're

1718
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,319
looking at is the what we're proposing

1719
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:25,039
for

1720
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:28,880
the format of the fci capacity limits

1721
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,319
payload type

1722
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:32,160
um kevin you had given some good

1723
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,440
feedback too

1724
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,280
particularly about the first two bullet

1725
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,359
points the total limits versus the host

1726
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:38,720
limits

1727
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,960
the current intention up here with the

1728
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,680
way it's currently structured was that

1729
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,960
the total limits object would represent

1730
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,359
all traffic delegated between

1731
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:52,079
an upstream and a downstream um

1732
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:54,319
so if the downstream says upstream you

1733
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:56,720
can delegate or you can uh send me 100

1734
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,559
gigabits per second that's ubiquitous

1735
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,680
across all cdn domains

1736
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,559
um

1737
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:05,200
this second section though was meant to

1738
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,480
allow

1739
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,200
the downstream to have some way shape or

1740
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,960
form to tell the upstream that

1741
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,640
certain type of traffic is different

1742
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,880
from other types of traffic low latency

1743
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,198
you know streaming is going to have a

1744
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:21,120
much different request profile than

1745
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,719
general game download or other style of

1746
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:26,880
bulk traffic and may have different

1747
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,560
utilization impacts on their

1748
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,000
infrastructure

1749
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,479
so being able to tie both of these

1750
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:34,000
elements together to say here's a

1751
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,640
general upstream you can delegate all of

1752
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,319
you know all of the total traffic you

1753
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:40,880
can delegate is governed by this

1754
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,040
along with if you're going to send me

1755
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,960
traffic on this host name which we know

1756
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,920
is low latency or some other high rps or

1757
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,040
whatever

1758
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,198
this is how we would be able to do

1759
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:52,880
make the differentiation

1760
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,880
such that all traffic is not created

1761
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,640
equal

1762
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,839
it's really going to become very

1763
01:08:57,839 --> 01:08:59,759
relevant once you get

1764
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:01,279
delegation relationships where an

1765
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:03,600
upstream could be delegating many many

1766
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,359
many different you know content

1767
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:07,120
providers or

1768
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,719
cdn domains

1769
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:10,640
and you're going to have a very

1770
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,279
heterogeneous blend of traffic and being

1771
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:15,759
able to specifically pick out a

1772
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:17,439
particular subset of that traffic and

1773
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:21,040
identify it differently than others

1774
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,799
was once again the intention behind the

1775
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:25,359
host limits but at the same time

1776
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,279
having this total limits really cuts

1777
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:29,759
down on the bulk of the request such

1778
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:30,719
that

1779
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,799
if we just assume the upstream has a

1780
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,920
certain profile will advertise a total

1781
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,719
traffic delegation now allotment

1782
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:41,040
except for the stuff that's the outlier

1783
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,719
so that's really the intention and the

1784
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:44,479
interaction points between these total

1785
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:47,120
limits and host limits payloads

1786
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,279
now kevin like you mentioned earlier

1787
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:50,960
there may be room for improvement here

1788
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,960
on simplifying the object structure by

1789
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,080
perhaps pulling the host out

1790
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,280
of

1791
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,040
the the host limits and

1792
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,960
specifying it within an object type of

1793
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,480
the total limits and just making the

1794
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,199
assumption that a lack of a host

1795
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:06,480
declaration

1796
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,560
assumes a total uh

1797
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,040
a total uh limit

1798
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,560
we will certainly take that back for

1799
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,320
consideration and update the draft

1800
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,840
accordingly based on that feedback

1801
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,440
um next slide please

1802
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,560
uh so this once again drew some very

1803
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,640
good chatter or very good

1804
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,760
feedback on the uh the list uh what is

1805
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,760
the fci telemetry here

1806
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,480
uh this object here is once again made

1807
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,719
to represent capabilities of supported

1808
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:39,040
telemetry so you know this is what it

1809
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,480
what is the downstream capable of

1810
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,760
supporting in terms of telemetry sources

1811
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,480
as we can see here um there's a type

1812
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,400
generic and this is once again a call

1813
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,960
out what we wanted to highlight in that

1814
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,159
this is really meant to be more of a

1815
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:56,320
accommodation for existing telemetry

1816
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,560
sources and also for the fact that there

1817
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,640
is no formal telemetry interface

1818
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,280
specified yet but we wanted to

1819
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,199
future-proof it a little bit based on

1820
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:07,280
the fact that eventually we hope that

1821
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,199
something will come of that and we're

1822
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:10,719
kind of leaving this the placeholder

1823
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:12,800
here but for the time being this is

1824
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,480
really the

1825
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,560
a way for the downstream to signal to

1826
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,239
the upstream that hey we support these

1827
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:20,000
different types of telemetry and it's

1828
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,120
also going to provide some of the

1829
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,640
linkage between

1830
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,040
what the telemetry source supports in

1831
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,560
terms of things such as timeline

1832
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,000
granularity

1833
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,760
percentile latency to near real time

1834
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,320
etc

1835
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:35,679
um

1836
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:41,480
any questions on this component here

1837
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,800
all right next side please

1838
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,640
uh so here

1839
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,239
is a

1840
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,719
very high level workflow of what we're

1841
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:52,800
anticipating all of this to kind of come

1842
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,719
together with

1843
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:55,440
so

1844
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,520
in the in this workflow here we're

1845
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,520
really describing the the upstream

1846
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,480
periodically pulling the downstream now

1847
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,000
the upstream has a couple different

1848
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,840
responsibilities the upstream would be

1849
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,480
pulling the downstream periodically to

1850
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,280
get what the capability or the the

1851
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,040
capabilities of capacity limits from the

1852
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,800
downstream are so that would be the top

1853
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,880
left diagram here

1854
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:17,760
so

1855
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,760
the downstream will respond back with an

1856
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,480
fci payload which will contain the fci

1857
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,080
capacity limits

1858
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,679
specific payload

1859
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,520
there would be a ttl associated with

1860
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:28,560
that

1861
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,360
currently our thought process is that we

1862
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:34,159
would use uh http cache control headers

1863
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:36,960
to govern that ttl uh

1864
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,960
that that fits nicely into the the

1865
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,120
framework of communication that the sva

1866
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,199
open caching project is

1867
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:46,159
um specifying um

1868
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:49,040
but in lieu of that the the upstream is

1869
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,800
expected to periodically pull the

1870
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,600
downstream to get what the advertised

1871
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,400
capability limits are for capacity the

1872
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,560
upstream is then also expected to

1873
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,239
periodically pull

1874
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:02,080
the telemetry source that the downstream

1875
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,000
is providing to gather and understand

1876
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,760
the current utilization that is

1877
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,679
represented by the upper right hand

1878
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,440
component of this

1879
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,679
then in the bottom it the upstream is

1880
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,840
then to be is then

1881
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,440
supposed to compare

1882
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,760
its current utilization towards the

1883
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,920
advertised

1884
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,440
capacity limits that the downstream is

1885
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,440
provided and adjust traffic routing

1886
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,920
decisions accordingly to fit within the

1887
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,159
advertised limits

1888
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:31,639
next slide please

1889
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:35,120
uh and here this is a call out again to

1890
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,120
the fact that we want to be able to make

1891
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:40,320
the we want to allow the downstream to

1892
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,400
potentially signal to the upstream that

1893
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,760
a change has been made to uh the fci

1894
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,080
capabilities for capacity limits

1895
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,480
uh this this model here was really uh

1896
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:53,040
governed or really more specific towards

1897
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,199
this the open caching the sv open

1898
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,800
caching workflow

1899
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,679
such that we'd be using callback

1900
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:00,560
hooks

1901
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,360
to

1902
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:02,480
um

1903
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,760
for subscriptions to uh sva or the fci

1904
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,320
capabilities updates but the the idea

1905
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,800
here is that we want the there is a

1906
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,800
mechanism for the downstream to signal

1907
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,040
back to the upstream there was a change

1908
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,440
in fci capabilities come pick up your

1909
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,400
net your

1910
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,640
your your newest version of your

1911
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,360
capacity limits um

1912
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,520
the the the main impetus for this is

1913
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,480
that we want to assume that the limits

1914
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,560
that were provided are

1915
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,199
expected to be you know

1916
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:35,199
valid unless

1917
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:37,040
you hear otherwise you know there

1918
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,440
shouldn't necessarily have to be

1919
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,440
a constant pulling from the upstream

1920
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,719
every five minutes and say hey if

1921
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:44,560
something changed hey something changed

1922
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,239
the intention here is that the

1923
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:47,679
downstream would give a kind of a

1924
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,920
long-standing order of capacity limits

1925
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,440
to the upstream

1926
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,719
which they would

1927
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:55,040
try to adhere to unless something

1928
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,560
changed on the downstream there was some

1929
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,239
event such as a

1930
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:00,880
massive loss of a data center the

1931
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,679
massive loss of capacity in a site or

1932
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:04,960
something of that effect which would

1933
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,120
warrant a signal up to the upstream to

1934
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:10,960
say come come get your updated limits

1935
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,159
uh next slide please

1936
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,440
this here is once again the

1937
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,280
the mechanism to allow

1938
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,800
the other side of the communication

1939
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,480
where the upstream would want to ask the

1940
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,280
downstream to reconsider limits

1941
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,800
up until now it's really been more of a

1942
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,320
one-sided conversation it's the

1943
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,400
downstream providing data to the

1944
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,719
upstream about this is what

1945
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:34,320
these are the limits we want you to hear

1946
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,120
to

1947
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,719
and the limits in this point are really

1948
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:38,480
considered like not to exceed style

1949
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,800
limits like please don't don't go past x

1950
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,560
amount of this telemetry source

1951
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,640
described value of bits per second

1952
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,640
requests per second etc

1953
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,400
but let's just say the upstream has some

1954
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,560
kind of a demand uh coming up that

1955
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,199
they're aware of and they'd like to ask

1956
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:56,159
uh their various downstream partners

1957
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:58,080
would you be willing to consider an

1958
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,239
update to support this

1959
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:02,719
this is the the vehicle that we came up

1960
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:04,960
with to allow uh to

1961
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,000
facilitate that conversation

1962
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,480
the the scoping here is really

1963
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,199
bound to how the metadata object model

1964
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:18,159
is uh set up in this particular case

1965
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:19,120
we're

1966
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,480
stating that this signal of mi requested

1967
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,159
capacity limits

1968
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,800
is bound specifically to this cdn domain

1969
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,280
of

1970
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,080
serviceaid.cdnexample.com

1971
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,800
that we really weren't able to

1972
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,600
come up with a clean way to

1973
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,440
allow the upstreams to just ask for

1974
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,199
generic um

1975
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:41,920
total delegation relationship uh

1976
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,640
advertisement updates uh right now the

1977
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,719
vehicle it's described using this

1978
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,679
metadata model is very specific to a

1979
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:52,560
particular host

1980
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,719
so

1981
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:56,239
at the moment

1982
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:57,600
that was

1983
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,000
were kind of somewhat constrained in how

1984
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,480
an upstream can really ask a downstream

1985
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,280
to reconsider updates based at this

1986
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,800
level of scoping

1987
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,960
are there any updates on this component

1988
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,400
or sorry requests sorry questions

1989
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,360
about this component

1990
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,400
yeah i think

1991
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,640
it's it's an interesting one

1992
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,920
it doesn't

1993
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,320
it may not fit exactly metadata but it's

1994
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,440
not really

1995
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,159
it's not a trigger it's a trigger to ask

1996
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:32,000
them to update this piece of metal that

1997
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,320
you can ask for an updated limit it's a

1998
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,800
weird kind of a flow um

1999
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,199
something we should we should

2000
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,120
dig into more that's the way that this

2001
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:44,239
is the best way to go about it uh or is

2002
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:45,280
i i

2003
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,120
i gather that you went this route

2004
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,440
because this was the only way you could

2005
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,320
figure to do it with the given apis with

2006
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,800
the given interfaces but

2007
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,719
it's not ideal for for your use case

2008
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:58,320
correct

2009
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,400
i would say that's an accurate case this

2010
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,320
was kind of a middle ground we came up

2011
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,400
with trying to adhere as closely as we

2012
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,199
can

2013
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:07,199
within the framework without boiling the

2014
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:08,800
ocean

2015
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,320
to your point you know it wasn't

2016
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,960
necessarily a trigger you know it's not

2017
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,480
necessarily

2018
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17,920
a true configuration but it it

2019
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,280
this was proposed by one of the

2020
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,120
co-authors ben

2021
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,199
as a a

2022
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:26,719
very clever solution i feel to use what

2023
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:28,400
we have available in order to

2024
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,000
accommodate um

2025
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,520
but like we mentioned there are some

2026
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,080
caveats we wish we didn't necessarily

2027
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,800
have i.e like the scoping to a

2028
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,679
particular host in this example

2029
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:42,000
but i think there would be we would

2030
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,199
welcome

2031
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:45,520
uh feedback on this footpart uh

2032
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:49,440
especially because this one was one that

2033
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,840
we feel

2034
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:55,120
need is the least straightforward of our

2035
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,679
proposal

2036
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:01,599
yep got it thanks

2037
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:05,440
on next slide please

2038
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,640
uh and once again this just kind of goes

2039
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,800
through how we would imagine

2040
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,280
using this mi uh requested capacity

2041
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,880
limits object you know the upstream

2042
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,159
would post that to the the downstream uh

2043
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:20,000
the downstream would then follow

2044
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,320
its particular it's already existing

2045
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:25,280
workflow on calculating uh current

2046
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,360
utilization

2047
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,360
based on a policy engine that is outside

2048
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,280
the scope of this document the

2049
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,719
downstream would then decide whether or

2050
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:34,480
not it wants to update

2051
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,360
its current uh capacity limits and then

2052
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,760
advertise that back up to the cdn or the

2053
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,560
upstream cdn

2054
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,320
um next slide please

2055
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,640
so that is the

2056
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,640
the proposal that we're coming forth

2057
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,360
today with um like i said we definitely

2058
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,960
welcome

2059
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,719
lots of feedback kevin i thank you very

2060
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:59,120
much for your feedback uh it's it's it

2061
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,199
was very good and we're certainly going

2062
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:03,840
to incorporate that in uh we would

2063
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:07,040
certainly love more feedback as well

2064
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,400
so please yeah

2065
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,759
if there's any questions please

2066
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,280
if anyone wants to i know the draft just

2067
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,600
came out before the deadline and so i

2068
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,120
don't know if everyone's had chances to

2069
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,639
read it but it is a good read i

2070
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:23,120
encourage everyone to go and take a look

2071
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,000
and

2072
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:24,800
um

2073
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,120
i post comments to the list that please

2074
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,960
everyone else read and post your

2075
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,960
comments as well there's

2076
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,719
you know some open questions there um

2077
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:35,760
some great ideas um so if other folks

2078
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,440
have thoughts um that'd be really

2079
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,759
helpful

2080
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:43,600
as a side note as well we're in terms of

2081
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,800
the

2082
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,480
this was kind of a

2083
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,320
spawn off from work being done via the

2084
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,000
streaming video alliance specifically

2085
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,159
for the open caching working group there

2086
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:54,400
is kind of a partner document to this

2087
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,120
that's specific to the sva

2088
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,679
and um we're going to hopefully have

2089
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:01,199
that

2090
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:02,239
maybe

2091
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:04,639
i'm not sure when available

2092
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:05,679
for

2093
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:08,159
a viewability as well which would help

2094
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:09,920
also provide additional context on the

2095
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,239
usage and where this kind of came from

2096
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:14,960
as well but once again there's been

2097
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,760
there's such a rich wealth of

2098
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,159
i guess

2099
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:23,120
of opportunity that's already baked into

2100
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,760
the cdni it just made sense to

2101
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,600
leverage that as much as possible and we

2102
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,800
felt that

2103
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,159
signaling capacity fit extremely well

2104
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:34,960
within the fci interface already

2105
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,719
we just wanted to provide the you know a

2106
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:38,480
vehicle to

2107
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,880
signal capacity via fci and that's

2108
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,960
really what this stock or this proposal

2109
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:47,040
here is mainly trying to get around to

2110
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,159
excellent thank you andrew um thank you

2111
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:51,360
for the presentation thank you for the

2112
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,320
draft

2113
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,239
uh again everybody go out and read the

2114
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:57,440
draft please and send comments back to

2115
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:58,880
andrew

2116
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,239
yeah uh uh a second then i think andrew

2117
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:04,480
you you covered a little bit of details

2118
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,320
here so i think that's helpful

2119
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:09,040
and hopefully um folks will have now a

2120
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,719
better sense of as they review the

2121
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:11,760
document

2122
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,239
so please go ahead and review it and

2123
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:17,839
post your comments on the mailing list

2124
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:22,159
all right thank you very much everybody

2125
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,159
all right glenn we're going to give this

2126
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:25,679
another shot

2127
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:27,679
can you hear me

2128
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:29,120
yes

2129
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,480
yay

2130
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,760
yeah okay

2131
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,920
i'm weirdly set up through the phone and

2132
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,360
there's an echo i'm going to turn down

2133
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:38,800
the audio are you hearing an echo no it

2134
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,159
sounds okay to me

2135
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:41,840
all right so i'm going to kill the audio

2136
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,159
so i want me to hear you guys

2137
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:47,040
so i'm just going to talk

2138
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,040
okay okay

2139
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,520
good i assume you got me now

2140
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,120
yes so

2141
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,760
i'll start with some background here on

2142
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,920
the configuration metadata project and

2143
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,199
then we kind of move into the current

2144
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:01,360
state of the draft um so go to the next

2145
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:04,840
slide yeah background next slide

2146
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,719
perfect um

2147
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:08,400
yes there's just some background on why

2148
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,960
the sva got into this and by the way uh

2149
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,120
my co-authors and contributors are on

2150
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,040
the line here so they can chime in as

2151
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:15,840
well

2152
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,960
um on this but uh you can go skip ahead

2153
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,639
you need to

2154
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:23,440
focus on this much go ahead perfect

2155
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,280
yeah so you know we started looking at

2156
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:28,159
cdni metadata for this and realized that

2157
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:30,000
the object model needed to be extended

2158
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,159
to handle some typical use cases for

2159
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:34,239
commercial cdns

2160
01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:35,120
and

2161
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,000
uh

2162
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,520
i won't get too much into the triggering

2163
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,760
and stuff but mostly we um

2164
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,840
we were looking at adding

2165
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:44,159
uh extensions to

2166
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:46,639
define cache policies and such so go

2167
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:48,000
into the next slide we'll kind of get

2168
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,760
right into it

2169
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,920
so this is the cdni metadata model that

2170
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,520
you all know and love from rfc 8006

2171
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,440
and the important thing to note here is

2172
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,600
the extensions we proposed all live

2173
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,520
within the set of generic metadata

2174
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,440
objects it's a new set of generic

2175
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,480
metadata objects and we made no uh

2176
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,159
proposed no changes at all to the

2177
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:09,520
structure

2178
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,400
um

2179
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,800
we've had one situation where this has

2180
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,239
been a little bit troublesome and i'll

2181
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:15,679
just mention it because it came up in

2182
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:17,920
capacity as well

2183
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,840
one of the metadata objects we've

2184
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,040
introduced

2185
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,040
is a service id

2186
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:26,080
and this idea that um you know most

2187
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,239
commercial cdns open caching systems

2188
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:30,480
have some sort of a skid of sku a cp

2189
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,480
code a service id

2190
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,480
and we've set it up so that those can be

2191
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:37,199
metadata but it's almost backwards

2192
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:40,080
in this model you define host names and

2193
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,320
then apply metadata to their host name

2194
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,239
so now we can say great if the host name

2195
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:47,040
is www.video.example.com

2196
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,280
then assign the service id

2197
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,280
but in fact cdn configurations are

2198
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,679
almost usually inverted you define a

2199
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:56,639
service id and then put hosts under it

2200
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:58,480
so this is a thing we may want to

2201
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,080
discuss in the future i just bring it up

2202
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,520
because it has been a little bit of an

2203
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:02,880
issue for us

2204
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:05,440
uh next slide

2205
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,679
this is the set of generic metadata

2206
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:09,840
objects that are in the rfc draft i

2207
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,480
think there's 13 of them here in red

2208
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,880
and each section in the draft just

2209
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,400
basically details the new generic

2210
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,199
metadata object its reason for being and

2211
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:21,679
its properties we'll get into that next

2212
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:24,000
slide

2213
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:25,440
the

2214
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,360
enhancements fall into these general

2215
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,760
categories enhanced source origin

2216
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,080
definitions and the main motivators

2217
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,840
there were to introduce

2218
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,159
load balancing and failover some

2219
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:38,080
authentication methods to authenticate

2220
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:41,040
to origins the aws

2221
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,719
method was mentioned earlier simple

2222
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,159
header off

2223
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:46,159
there's a lot of work done in increased

2224
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:48,560
cash control policies and a lot of the

2225
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,000
motivation behind those and i'll address

2226
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
some of the questions that kevin had

2227
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,560
brought up

2228
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,280
yes the origin or the content provider

2229
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:00,239
can specify cache control in headers

2230
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:01,600
coming out of the responses from the

2231
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,800
origin

2232
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,520
but typically we need to define caching

2233
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,600
rules not only for the end client the

2234
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:11,280
user agent but caching rules for the cdn

2235
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,360
and they're often different parameters

2236
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,199
you may want different internal caching

2237
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:18,320
rules or times in the cdn than you would

2238
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,400
want downstream so that's the motivation

2239
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:24,239
from any of these cash policy extensions

2240
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,320
there's a whole set of extensions on

2241
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,719
dynamic cores

2242
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:30,320
headers

2243
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,159
traffic type i'll get into that service

2244
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:35,040
ids i mentioned

2245
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:38,320
open caching configurations as part of

2246
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:41,199
defining open caching request routing

2247
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:43,760
rules uh we had the need for some

2248
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,360
metadata there some configuration

2249
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:48,239
metadata some objects went in there

2250
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:50,400
private features came up and there were

2251
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,080
some questions kevin had about that as

2252
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,199
well

2253
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:55,440
you could keep adding private features

2254
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,600
by having more and more generic metadata

2255
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,600
objects this is true but we wanted to

2256
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,000
have a structure around it so that

2257
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,960
organizations like the sva could have

2258
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,199
their a registry of their own private

2259
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:09,440
features that would really uh sit

2260
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,320
internal into uh

2261
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,480
into this one object without additional

2262
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,840
generic metadata

2263
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:19,600
objects um and lastly the processing

2264
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,239
stage model which i'll dive into deeper

2265
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:23,760
can you all hear me okay all right

2266
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,440
sanjay want to give me a yeah hands up

2267
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:30,400
um alfonso you have a question here so

2268
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,840
do you want to go uh yeah it's just to

2269
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:36,560
to add um about the cash control

2270
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,880
policies dynamic courthouse all that

2271
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,400
glenn has explained

2272
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,360
um

2273
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,520
that other of the motivations i think

2274
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:48,320
for for this is that many cdns act as um

2275
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,560
super projected origins so projectors i

2276
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,960
think this is the name it's an old draft

2277
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:57,120
from the atf um so they present to the

2278
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:00,000
users more like an origin and not like a

2279
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,440
catch system

2280
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:04,800
so they are acting as an origin from the

2281
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,760
content provider perspective um sorry

2282
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,600
and for the user

2283
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:10,400
so

2284
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:11,199
it's

2285
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:14,159
very common these use cases where the

2286
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:16,080
audience of the of a content provider of

2287
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:17,600
an absence at the end

2288
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,920
doesn't wants to make all the things

2289
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,159
that could be required for

2290
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:25,760
a user making that request but let the

2291
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:28,239
super project origin to do though that

2292
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:30,560
that job uh one example could be the

2293
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,440
dynamic headers where uh maybe they

2294
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,760
don't want to handle that in the origin

2295
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,560
but let the cdn to do that job and to

2296
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,159
select the adequate

2297
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:42,080
core header to present to the user this

2298
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:44,080
this is the kind of motivation on some

2299
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:48,800
of these uh new generic metadata objects

2300
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:51,920
good

2301
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,080
uh next slide

2302
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:57,639
oh any other comments

2303
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,639
yeah so a big piece of the work that was

2304
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:03,280
added was this definition of processing

2305
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,280
stages and i noted kevin's recent

2306
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,040
comment that this may be big enough to

2307
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,760
be broken out into its own draft and we

2308
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:13,679
can consider that for an extra version

2309
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:17,360
the idea here though is that metadata

2310
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,760
needs to be applied at various

2311
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:22,159
really these four key points in the

2312
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:24,960
request response processing pipeline

2313
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,880
and this structure enables us to

2314
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,280
attach metadata at these four points in

2315
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:33,679
the request response pipeline

2316
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:35,199
typically

2317
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:37,360
you may for example have a cached

2318
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:38,480
response

2319
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:39,520
this

2320
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,120
the client response portion of it

2321
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,440
labeled d in the diagram and you may

2322
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,440
want to adjust the response for each

2323
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,440
client as it comes out of cache this

2324
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,120
gives you an ability to do that sort of

2325
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,719
a thing

2326
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:53,679
most processing happens generally

2327
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:55,040
uh on

2328
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,360
the first on getting a uh request from

2329
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,280
the client and i'm processing response

2330
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,120
from the origin but this does give we've

2331
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:03,199
seen use cases over the years that call

2332
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:05,679
for all four of these stages

2333
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:08,560
next slide please

2334
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,320
this is the data model that we've

2335
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,960
designed for the processing stages this

2336
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,520
diagram thanks to alfonso's ascii

2337
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,239
artwork is now in the revision the

2338
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:21,840
latest provision of the draft thanks

2339
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,920
alfonso for that

2340
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,840
so it defines really a new generic

2341
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,920
metadata object which is processing

2342
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:29,040
stages

2343
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,920
and it's got a set of rules and there's

2344
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,000
rules for each of the four stages you

2345
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,239
saw on the previous diagram

2346
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:38,800
each rule essentially is structured as a

2347
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,360
match expression and then metadata to be

2348
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:44,000
applied if that match

2349
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,400
hits this allows you to effectively

2350
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,239
conditionally do things at certain

2351
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:49,440
stages

2352
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,280
based on a match

2353
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,600
uh on the request side it may be a match

2354
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,239
on some pattern of the request url or on

2355
01:30:56,239 --> 01:30:58,560
a header and on the response side you

2356
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,159
might typically be matching on some

2357
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:02,800
element of the response or a status code

2358
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,880
sanjay did you have something

2359
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,400
no no i'm good

2360
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:07,520
okay

2361
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:08,960
i have to keep the volume low because i

2362
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:11,360
got this crazy echo here

2363
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:12,719
um

2364
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:14,320
so

2365
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,639
with it beyond the express the uh

2366
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:19,280
expression matching once you do apply a

2367
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,920
rule at a certain stage

2368
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:24,000
you essentially either transforming the

2369
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,040
request

2370
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:27,920
transforming the response or generating

2371
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,679
a complete synthetic response those are

2372
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:32,159
generally kinds of things that go on

2373
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:34,159
um there's probably enough detail here

2374
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:35,520
for now there's structures here that

2375
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:38,320
allow you to specify lists of headers

2376
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:39,920
that can be added lists of headers that

2377
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:42,239
can be replaced etc

2378
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:45,559
next slide

2379
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,880
good so here's a typical full example of

2380
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:52,159
a processing stage a very simple one

2381
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:54,440
in this example for

2382
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:57,520
edge.example.com standard host index

2383
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,320
we introduce a processing stage at the

2384
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,560
origin response so dealing with

2385
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,960
responses coming out of the origin

2386
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:07,360
and we're looking for a match so here's

2387
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,360
a simple example of the metadata

2388
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,040
expression language which i'll get into

2389
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:13,760
next basically if response status code

2390
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,199
is a 200

2391
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:17,840
then go ahead and apply some metadata

2392
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,760
and in this example the metadata is a

2393
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:22,719
cache policy that tells the cdn to cache

2394
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:24,639
internally for five seconds

2395
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:26,800
so that's a very simple uh type of rule

2396
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,520
that one might do

2397
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,679
next slide

2398
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:36,080
so in the original draft we proposed

2399
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,520
that there would be this expression

2400
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,520
language and the expression language

2401
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,840
really does two things it allows

2402
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:44,480
to define criteria for matching

2403
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,719
you know to apply rules conditionally

2404
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:49,360
and it also there are certain um

2405
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,880
areas where we actually have to

2406
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,639
synthesize a response so there's an

2407
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:55,760
example of one here and in the new um

2408
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,440
version of the draft

2409
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,440
the metadata expression language is

2410
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,040
called out with the

2411
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:02,960
syntax for the various variables and

2412
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,080
expressions

2413
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,080
so the first expression here is a simple

2414
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,760
expression match this may be a typical

2415
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,280
thing you would do

2416
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,800
to apply metadata on

2417
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,440
in this example is a request coming from

2418
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:18,239
safari for host example.com

2419
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:20,320
and so you could therefore apply

2420
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,480
metadata just based on a match on a user

2421
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,400
agent or something like that

2422
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:27,280
the second example

2423
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:28,400
is

2424
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,239
using the expression language to

2425
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:33,360
dynamically or to synthesize a value

2426
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:34,159
so

2427
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:36,639
in this example we are transforming a

2428
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:38,080
response that may have coming out from

2429
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,560
an origin and we're adding a cookie

2430
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,159
and the cookie we want to add

2431
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:44,639
specifically is concatenation

2432
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:46,480
of the user agent string and the host

2433
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,560
name so that's the value

2434
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,560
and then there's other thing the value

2435
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,639
is expression is true that's just a

2436
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:55,280
signal to the uh engine processing this

2437
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,199
that value is not a string literal that

2438
01:33:57,199 --> 01:34:00,320
it needs to be evaluated

2439
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:04,719
uh next slide

2440
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:05,760
yeah

2441
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:09,440
uh no actually the sorry go back

2442
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,440
yeah

2443
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:12,639
um

2444
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:14,239
oh okay that's it that's never mind go

2445
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:15,440
to capacity we're doing well

2446
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:16,960
capabilities interface sorry i'm looking

2447
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,400
at two screens at once

2448
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:19,120
so

2449
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:21,440
as we add new metadata and all these new

2450
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,920
capabilities of course fci needs to come

2451
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:25,360
along for the ride

2452
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,679
so we needed to add

2453
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:31,199
some fci objects that are also uh called

2454
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:33,600
out in this document

2455
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,320
to so that a downstream cdn can declare

2456
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,560
its ability to support these new

2457
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:41,760
metadata constructs

2458
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:44,080
next

2459
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:46,639
really out of scope for this discussion

2460
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:49,040
but just to put it all in context

2461
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:49,760
we

2462
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:52,800
also within the sva have extended the uh

2463
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,639
metadata interface originally proposed

2464
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:56,560
in rfc8006

2465
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:59,119
and there's some sva documents uh being

2466
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:01,119
pushed through this would really work uh

2467
01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:02,080
led by

2468
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:07,360
guillaume and alfonso um and that's uh

2469
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:08,800
probably not no need to discuss it more

2470
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,239
now but just to for reference that it's

2471
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:11,520
there

2472
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:12,960
okay let's kind of move ahead here

2473
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,840
status of the draft

2474
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:18,400
next slide

2475
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:21,600
i have a quick question um yes okay

2476
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,040
so

2477
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,719
the ability to

2478
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,679
publish so um 39 metadata is a trigger

2479
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:30,000
goal

2480
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:35,199
or invalidate his meditator

2481
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:36,639
um

2482
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:38,639
are there specific

2483
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:41,440
to that um interaction that were

2484
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,360
undesirable or

2485
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,480
are there

2486
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,880
any other things are you i just are you

2487
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:49,440
actually bringing these to the working

2488
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,678
group

2489
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,440
yeah i mean the original spec was

2490
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,600
exactly that the upstream triggers the

2491
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,440
downstream to pull metadata and that's

2492
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,360
great but really what we're looking at

2493
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:03,440
is use cases here where the upstream

2494
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,520
pushes metadata into the downstream

2495
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,360
effectively publishing configuration

2496
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,280
metadata that was probably one of the

2497
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,679
biggest changes we've introduced

2498
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:12,719
i don't know if guillaume if you want to

2499
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:15,199
add to that

2500
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,320
and do you think that is the eventual

2501
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,960
goal to to rev

2502
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,080
rfc

2503
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,080
8006 or

2504
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,159
is it something that just

2505
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:33,840
probably stays an add-on within sba

2506
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:38,800
we we we can discuss that with an sva

2507
01:36:39,119 --> 01:36:41,679
within sva we have a whole set of apis

2508
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:44,080
that implement the suite of open caching

2509
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:46,719
capabilities of this is just one of many

2510
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:48,239
and that api

2511
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:49,679
implements

2512
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:52,320
our metadata publishing interface which

2513
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,560
effectively is an extension of the cdni

2514
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,239
metadata interface

2515
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:57,920
but uh sanji i think let's talk about

2516
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,920
that within the sva and see how much of

2517
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:03,199
that api we want to put in

2518
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:11,199
yes yes look to what

2519
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:14,239
these changes are compatible with the

2520
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:15,440
trigger

2521
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,199
interface so

2522
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:18,400
it is

2523
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,880
more than possible to use use these

2524
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:24,159
extensions with the trigger interface uh

2525
01:37:24,159 --> 01:37:27,600
even if we are defining a new api

2526
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:30,000
for some use cases that and we are

2527
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,320
implementing at this

2528
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,320
dvd

2529
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:37,679
for that api but used to be a

2530
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:40,080
interface

2531
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,440
yeah and we can uh start a discussion in

2532
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:46,480
the mailing list about uh the sva apis

2533
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:47,600
and whether we feel there would be

2534
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:51,440
interest in pushing those into the iutf

2535
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:52,800
right that would probably be something

2536
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,960
we'd have to return her for but it's an

2537
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:55,920
interesting

2538
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:59,199
discussion point if there's you know

2539
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:01,679
need for that obviously

2540
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:04,400
there's value in being able to do pushes

2541
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,960
i i'm totally down with that but and we

2542
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,360
discussed it early on but um

2543
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:11,520
yeah it's an interesting thing to bring

2544
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,119
back

2545
01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:14,719
well while we're on the subject so the

2546
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:17,040
api that we've currently done really the

2547
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,880
big thing it adds is a push

2548
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,400
but we're going to be looking at a next

2549
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,400
round of api work

2550
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:25,040
that really addresses the whole workflow

2551
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:27,840
around managing cdn configurations and

2552
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:31,040
that's where we plan on handling

2553
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:34,000
versions of metadata

2554
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
publishing from staging to production

2555
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,280
environment

2556
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:38,719
rollbacks

2557
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:40,719
lists of generic metadata objects that

2558
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:43,280
can be used across configurations so all

2559
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:45,040
of that might work the ietf is

2560
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:48,080
interested in as well

2561
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:51,840
i had one other quick comment um it's

2562
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,199
impressive that

2563
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:54,159
the um

2564
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:55,520
the

2565
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:58,239
processing stages stuff was all

2566
01:38:58,239 --> 01:39:00,639
um able to be implemented in just

2567
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:03,199
generic metadata i was wondering

2568
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:04,000
if

2569
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,199
there was

2570
01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:08,320
um if that was done just because it was

2571
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,320
a good way to get it into the metadata

2572
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,000
interface or if that was the preferred

2573
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,119
method or was there you know

2574
01:39:15,119 --> 01:39:17,199
also considerations for

2575
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:19,280
changes to the metadata interface that

2576
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:22,080
would make that more convenient well

2577
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,880
that was creative data modeling on my

2578
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:27,920
part to make it fit within the generic

2579
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:31,199
metadata rules as i was told the best

2580
01:39:31,199 --> 01:39:33,360
way to move this through ietf is not to

2581
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,760
change the structural amount of data

2582
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:37,760
but in fact i think it fit pretty well

2583
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,679
if you want to go back to that scheme a

2584
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:43,440
few slides back i think it worked

2585
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,199
yeah i thought and then i liked the

2586
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:49,119
ascii drawings too those were awesome um

2587
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:51,600
it is impressive and i think the whole

2588
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:53,520
processing stage is

2589
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,840
uh issue of you know where do you apply

2590
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:56,639
it in

2591
01:39:56,639 --> 01:39:58,880
ingress going to the origin coming back

2592
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,080
or coming out

2593
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:02,480
it's a useful piece that we never

2594
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,400
considered um

2595
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:05,840
but as long as

2596
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,520
i yeah i just really wanted to figure

2597
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:08,719
out you know

2598
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:10,480
is this the right way to do it or is

2599
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:12,239
there a better way to do it and if if in

2600
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:14,080
the end we like this way then that's

2601
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:15,280
even better

2602
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,719
i feel pretty good about it and i think

2603
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:19,040
it's a nice clean structure of

2604
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:20,840
organizing it with

2605
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,719
rules applied based on the match data

2606
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:24,719
and then each rule is a header or

2607
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:26,560
response transform that's pretty

2608
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,000
straightforward stuff for anybody who's

2609
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,320
worked with web server configurations so

2610
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,080
i think it's all right

2611
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:34,080
excellent okay cool all right you'll

2612
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,760
move on down to the revisions we're

2613
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:36,960
almost on here

2614
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:39,119
so draft status next

2615
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:40,880
yeah so this is basically a summary of

2616
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:43,280
what changed from revision zero version

2617
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:45,840
zero was a very thin shell apologies for

2618
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,440
that but now there's enough information

2619
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:49,360
in here to sink your teeth into

2620
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:52,000
there's a couple diagrams there are some

2621
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,679
examples but

2622
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:56,159
we have many more diagrams to put in

2623
01:40:56,159 --> 01:40:58,239
really what's going on here is that

2624
01:40:58,239 --> 01:41:00,000
within the sva we have a set of

2625
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,320
specifications that are being actually

2626
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:05,760
reviewed right now and this particular

2627
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,960
draft is derived from an sva spec and so

2628
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:10,560
now actually and that's going through a

2629
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:11,920
review process and now we're going to

2630
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:13,920
face the challenge of unfortunately

2631
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,000
keeping an internal sva dock in sync

2632
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,199
with this draft as they both get rev

2633
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:21,600
but we will rev them together and as we

2634
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,600
go through our review process within the

2635
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:24,880
sva

2636
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:26,960
we'll coordinate that with creating a

2637
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:29,360
revision two here and that will have a

2638
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:31,840
lot more examples so each proposed new

2639
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,679
generic metadata object will have an

2640
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:35,119
example in there with it which is what

2641
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:36,880
you want to see

2642
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,639
um and then the metadata expression

2643
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:42,960
language portion was added as well here

2644
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,600
um i think the next couple slides were

2645
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,760
just some answers i had put in line of

2646
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:49,840
some original questions kevin opposed on

2647
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:52,159
revision zero probably no need to go

2648
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:54,320
through those now i'll post

2649
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:55,840
kevin the best thing for me to do is to

2650
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,800
put post all that in the sva into the

2651
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,800
cdni mailing list in response to your

2652
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,320
questions right

2653
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:03,600
yes please

2654
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,520
yeah and i'll do that for the same for

2655
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,520
your new set of questions as you develop

2656
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,280
them or questions from anyone else on

2657
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:10,719
this revision

2658
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:13,119
and we'll plan on revision two

2659
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:15,199
probably in a month or two

2660
01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:18,480
uh like i said coordinated with um sva

2661
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:20,480
review work that's going on on the sva

2662
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:23,360
version of this document

2663
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:24,800
and we'll just wrap it up on the final

2664
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,000
slide

2665
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,960
um can the cdi working group accept this

2666
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:33,119
uh version as a working group draft

2667
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:36,719
i think um this draft was big uh it

2668
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:38,239
definitely had a lot more detail than

2669
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:40,960
the one we saw earlier in the summer um

2670
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,440
thank you for that uh it was dense i

2671
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,040
haven't made it all the way through

2672
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,800
completely yet i need to give it another

2673
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,080
read myself

2674
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,639
um and i know it just came out so i

2675
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:53,119
encourage everyone out there to please

2676
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:55,199
go and read the draft there's a lot of

2677
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:57,440
cool stuff in the draft and

2678
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:58,159
um

2679
01:42:58,159 --> 01:42:59,760
we should

2680
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:02,400
we should you know possibly divide it up

2681
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,960
into separate drafts there's some that's

2682
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,280
more straightforward like cash control

2683
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:11,040
policies um those are probably less um

2684
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:12,560
less discussion

2685
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,800
points for those than there are for the

2686
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:15,679
actual

2687
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:17,679
um expression language right there's

2688
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:19,920
there's a lot to parse through there

2689
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:22,400
that's a pun sorry um

2690
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:25,040
but uh i i think that you know we could

2691
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,520
probably um

2692
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:30,080
first see how folks reacted on the list

2693
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:31,760
um i'd like to have

2694
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,600
give some give folks some time to read

2695
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:36,239
it because it is fairly big but

2696
01:43:36,239 --> 01:43:38,080
um and then we can start picking and

2697
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:40,239
choosing deciding you know how we want

2698
01:43:40,239 --> 01:43:41,840
to pursue each other

2699
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,440
think that's in there

2700
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:45,600
yeah i think it could be reasonable to

2701
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:47,920
to break out the expression language

2702
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:49,760
portion and the processing stage in

2703
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,280
portions in a separate drafts if you

2704
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:53,040
think that's uh more manageable i think

2705
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,800
you're right

2706
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,280
and if there are specific groupings of

2707
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:59,600
metadata right the cash policy ones

2708
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,480
could all go together um i don't know

2709
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,320
maybe put them together in a chapter on

2710
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:05,600
their own yeah

2711
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:06,719
yeah

2712
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:08,719
and that may make things easier if

2713
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:11,600
they're if you know a they have specific

2714
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,040
use cases around them they're much

2715
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:15,119
easier to describe and there's less you

2716
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:16,960
know mental

2717
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:19,679
context switching as as well as it's

2718
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:21,920
easier to digest for folks

2719
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:24,080
than a 60 page draft

2720
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:25,760
i think you're right yeah this is a

2721
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,920
problem in the sva version as well i

2722
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,239
think 13 new generic metadata objects

2723
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:32,000
are just listed in alphabetical order

2724
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,560
and that's probably in retrospect not

2725
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,040
the best way

2726
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:39,440
yeah so i i think i think that we could

2727
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,360
definitely get more velocity there if we

2728
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:43,119
group them and then put the use case in

2729
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:44,880
and make them easier to digest

2730
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:47,520
individually

2731
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:49,760
good that's just my two cents

2732
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:52,000
no i think that that that makes sense uh

2733
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,920
that that makes it easier

2734
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,840
to sort of read relevant information

2735
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,760
together and then um

2736
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:00,000
easier to respond that yes this makes

2737
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,560
sense and uh let's let's go with this

2738
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:04,639
draft so i think glenn that's a good

2739
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:06,480
idea if we

2740
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,239
if there's an effort to break it down

2741
01:45:08,239 --> 01:45:09,119
into

2742
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:10,960
you know based on metadata

2743
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:12,239
you know similar

2744
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:14,480
metadata you know types and have that

2745
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,400
draft that will stand on its own

2746
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,560
i think that may be easier

2747
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:19,600
yeah

2748
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,760
and and i think also just for the sva

2749
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:23,840
folks on the call i mentioned this

2750
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:25,360
rather than going through the pain of

2751
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:27,840
maintaining two parallel docs we may

2752
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:30,480
start to cut out the sva part 2 dock the

2753
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,639
one that this is derived from and just

2754
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:34,400
have the sva dock start to wrap and

2755
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,080
reference this one that may make life a

2756
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:38,719
lot easier easier

2757
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:40,000
but we'll figure that out for ourselves

2758
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,639
in the sva

2759
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:44,480
excellent

2760
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:47,280
um does anyone else have any questions

2761
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:50,320
or comments for glenn

2762
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:56,880
sorry for the microphone mess up glad it

2763
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:58,560
worked out

2764
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,400
no worries thank you for for your

2765
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,960
persistence

2766
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:07,280
um

2767
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:10,080
if there's nothing else that is the end

2768
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:13,360
of the agenda items we had for today um

2769
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:15,600
it looks like we finished a little bit

2770
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:16,560
early

2771
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:18,239
which is great but we had a lot of great

2772
01:46:18,239 --> 01:46:19,360
discussions

2773
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:20,719
um

2774
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:22,719
if no one has any other comments i think

2775
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:24,480
we can close the session

2776
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:26,480
