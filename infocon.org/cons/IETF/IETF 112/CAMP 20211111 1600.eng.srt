4
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,640
yes

5
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,079

uh

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,960
welcome to our sitcam session

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,960
so uh good morning

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,800
uh good afternoon good evening

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,160
let's start from the

15
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,358
first page

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,200
okay as always let's start from the load

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,080
where

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,360
information

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,320
you know actually uh this demand about

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,159
the ietf policies

21
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,159
and you know arduino by participating in

22
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,280
the ietf we have to follow itf process

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,200
and policies

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,520
especially ipr policies

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,799
so you know

26
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,799
there are a couple of the

27
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,000
documents about the bc bcp

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,040
so

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,159
if anyone is new to itf please take a

30
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,840
look look at these documents

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,000
and

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,360
this time we have only one session uh

33
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,159
with two hours and you can get some

34
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,479
detailed information from the uh the

35
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,280
link

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,079
and also uh download some uh slides

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,880
so uh this the agenda

38
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,920
uh this time we still have you know uh

39
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,520
busy agenda

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,920
actually uh we have two hours for for

41
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,679
decision but we

42
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,640
we have nine presentations

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,879
and uh five of them

44
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,840
are about you know our individual jobs

45
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,400
so maybe we can have more discussion on

46
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,879
their own especially some

47
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,760
some new jobs

48
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,239
so uh for an administrative

49
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,879
so you know actually because of that

50
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,319
cop19

51
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,879
we are used you know to have enter

52
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,280
online meeting by the with echo so i

53
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,040
think we know how to use the on this

54
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,319
kind of online tour

55
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,480
and then for the minute takers

56
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,760
so if anyone can take some you know uh

57
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,800
minutes

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,440
and that will be much appreciated and i

59
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,159
also ask how men to help us

60
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,400
and and i'm not sure if for those kids

61
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,680
it's uh

62
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,280
it's joining or not

63
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,800
maybe uh security is not

64
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,920
online let me check

65
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,599
oh oscar you are here

66
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,839
maybe you can help me out help us out

67
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,000
and then uh

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,159
blue sheets so

69
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,000
actually you know the blue sheets will

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,560
be created automatically and nothing for

71
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,799
us to do

72
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,200
and then we have the reminder about the

73
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,440
ipr process you know

74
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,959
uh

75
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,599
you know uh before for example an

76
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,440
individual draft becomes to a working

77
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,400
group document or a working

78
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,720
group document goes to last call the

79
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,440
chairs were sent out to ipr polling uh

80
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,159
and then uh it requires

81
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,080
after you know authors and the

82
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,720
contributors to the sponsor polling as

83
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,000
soon as possible

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,159
otherwise it might delay your you know

85
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,599
or draft to move forward

86
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,959
and then about the main list we always

87
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,959
encourage people to use the main list as

88
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,879
much as possible you know

89
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,360
we can you know uh for example uh

90
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,639
introduce some

91
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,680
uh discuss some open issues or introduce

92
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,040
some new ideas or and some new jobs on

93
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,000
the list

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,639
and also we may you know discuss some

95
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,880
potential on new topics

96
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,919
you know uh relevant to the camp

97
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,840
and also this

98
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,160
one important implement is that booking

99
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,120
group consensus you know it's determined

100
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,000
on the main list rather than if we got

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,080
some consensus in the you know online

102
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,520
meeting and we still need to bring to

103
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,479
the list

104
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,639
okay daniel is for you

105
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,560
yes

106
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,199
next please

107
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,960
yeah

108
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,720
okay we

109
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,199
since the last meeting we have two new

110
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,639
rfcs

111
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,960
1993 1994

112
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,160
both

113
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,320
are young models

114
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,440
uh basically the first one is the layer

115
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,039
zero types and the second one is the

116
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,160
young data model for

117
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,039
ws on wson networks

118
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:29,840
so

119
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,000
if i'm not mistaken these are the first

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,160
two

121
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,000
drafts on

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,240
than the first two young models on

123
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,280
optical optical networks so

124
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,080
a big achievement

125
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,479
we are extremely happy about that

126
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,800
next please

127
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,080
we have

128
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,280
a bunch of

129
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,560
working group

130
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,759
drafts being discussed today

131
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,759
most of them if not all are young models

132
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,680
basically we have the optical impairment

133
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,120
topology

134
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,160
uh

135
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,280
the extension to the layer zero types if

136
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,919
you could remember we

137
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,479
we published the layer zero types and

138
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,400
immediately after that we started

139
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,560
working on an extension of them to

140
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,240
include also

141
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,400
transponders etc

142
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,960
we have a

143
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,479
good progresses on the flexi grid

144
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,360
documents the the the media the media

145
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,680
channel and the the young model and the

146
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,120
one on microwave microwave topology

147
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,280
there are other working group drafts in

148
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,319
the next

149
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,840
in the next slide which are not

150
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,880
discussed today

151
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,960
uh there are no big changes since uh the

152
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,840
the last meeting on them we have the

153
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,680
interface documents with lmps functions

154
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,360
and

155
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,599
the

156
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,520
young model for

157
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,919
interface parameters

158
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,720
we have the uh applicability of

159
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,680
otn beyond 100 gigabits but this is just

160
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,560
i mean

161
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,240
this is uh

162
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,120
already at a pretty advanced stage i

163
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,599
don't think anymore we will see any more

164
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,360
changes there

165
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,639
uh

166
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,080
next items

167
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,960
to be

168
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,639
uh let me say

169
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,720
discuss the for final review are

170
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,000
related to otn in particular the uh

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,520
topology and the tunnel model

172
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,680
and then the two drafts on

173
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,400
on client signal the cliente topology

174
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,039
for ethernet and the young model for

175
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,199
client signals

176
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,840
next please

177
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,240
a brief update

178
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,120
on some of on some of them we have the

179
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,639
layer one

180
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,080
types

181
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,639
which is basically the final the

182
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,800
the young types for for layer one we

183
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,440
have minimal updates updates there

184
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,720
uh it's this is ready for uh

185
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,039
to be to be published to be moved

186
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,840
forward

187
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,680
uh a working group plus call has been

188
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,199
has been requested

189
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,960
the tunnel model

190
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,880
uh this was basically waiting for the t

191
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,599
tunnel draft in uh

192
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,839
in teas which is being uh

193
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,519
progressed in in these days so

194
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,839
we no longer have

195
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,000
a dependency there and we can move these

196
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,680
forward

197
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,839
after it's been updated to align with

198
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:56,560
the

199
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,120
the latest the latest updates

200
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,360
and

201
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,080
we needed to request for the young

202
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,320
doctor review

203
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,160
next next ones uh we are next ones yes

204
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,279
we have the later one csm

205
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,920
uh this is more uh

206
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,800
keep at life this is ready for working

207
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,399
group las cola

208
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,279
uh

209
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,399
there is a

210
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,360
dependency on the layer one types but

211
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,320
uh

212
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,800
player one types is

213
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,880
almost almost there as well

214
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,360
uh the nbi applicability statement this

215
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,519
was uh

216
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,080
last called it it has been put on old uh

217
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,140
to try to

218
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,120
[Music]

219
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,790
put it on a diet as as don said

220
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,200
[Music]

221
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,360
that there were some comments and the

222
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,120
authors were trying to reduce it a

223
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,360
little bit because it was an extremely

224
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,640
big

225
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,560
uh document

226
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,480
um

227
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,600
[Music]

228
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,680
the authors are working are working on

229
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,800
an update and

230
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,920
which will be available soon

231
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,560
next please

232
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,560
and i think that's it there is

233
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,600
no liaison or communication incoming or

234
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,160
outgoing since since last meeting

235
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,440
i think we can start with the first

236
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,160
presentation

237
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,600
okay let's move to the first

238
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,399
presentation

239
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,800
i think this might present by detail

240
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,399
hello

241
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,839
can you hear me

242
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:48,959
hi

243
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,760
hi

244
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,880
yes hi everybody i'm sergio belotti

245
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,800
speaking from nokia

246
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,880
i'm going to

247
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,120
uh provide the status and they

248
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,920
about optical impairment topology young

249
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,839
model

250
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,519
on behalf of

251
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,279
the other

252
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,440
quotas and

253
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,000
contributors

254
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,880
next slide

255
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,519
okay um

256
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,120
we have a

257
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,560
group

258
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,760
that is uh actually weekly hour meeting

259
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,600
in which we progress the document and we

260
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,279
are going on

261
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,560
on to have this weekly

262
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,600
and

263
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
and work

264
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,160
during this

265
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,839
the time dedicated to that

266
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,839
there are

267
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,320
from the last itf

268
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,600
we have provided that a lot of

269
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,399
work

270
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,360
because

271
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,320
we

272
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,200
have progress both in the

273
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,680
text of the draft

274
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,320
in which we

275
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,760
we

276
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,120
added the

277
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,639
section

278
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,800
about existing

279
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,600
uh

280
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,279
the the reason to know the existing tsi

281
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,880
signal for

282
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,639
oms link

283
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,200
we added a further section

284
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,000
about oms media link and the

285
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,720
transponders part

286
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,480
clarifying the

287
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,399
bidirectionality

288
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,959
of both ltp and tunnel termination point

289
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,480
and we added text about geolocation

290
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,440
information that has been provided and

291
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,800
added in the also in the young part

292
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,880
for young model

293
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,120
we started to resolve the issue that was

294
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,040
presented

295
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,120
in the last itf

296
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,880
uh the 83

297
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,000
that was regarding 3r regenerator and

298
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,200
with this

299
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,160
solving the issue we complete the trial

300
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,200
modeling

301
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,200
and then we fix it the other

302
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,720
issue on the on the model

303
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,720
next

304
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,959
so

305
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,920
this slide is just as the background for

306
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,880
the neck for the last meeting so

307
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,320
uh we uh left lift left each other in

308
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,519
the 111 itf

309
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,040
with this problem so how to associate

310
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,639
the transceiver

311
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,839
uh to provide the trial in 3r

312
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,519
configuration

313
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,639
that is a trivial case in

314
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,680
in the case of tsig is

315
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,639
presented just one otsi but is not

316
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,639
trivial in case we have multiple tsi

317
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,639
next

318
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,639
so to solve the issue we have a a

319
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,040
detailed discussion and basically the

320
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,839
conclusion was to

321
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,079
base the solution

322
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,160
of

323
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,079
to model the connectivity uh considering

324
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,880
primarily the real

325
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,959
the real physical constraint

326
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,639
and

327
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,040
the physical constraining the equipment

328
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,800
at the node level and we made

329
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,639
five

330
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,040
main assumptions the first for the

331
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,199
solution we

332
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,920
succeed to define groups a regenerator

333
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,040
group

334
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,320
created a transponder level associating

335
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,519
a transponder

336
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,360
in which way

337
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,680
the transponder are

338
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,440
any group of

339
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,600
of transponder

340
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,279
represent a set of transponder where

341
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,720
there is a an electrical connectivity

342
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
in place so

343
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,959
pre-provisioning or could be also

344
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,720
dynamically provisioned

345
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,600
to associate this transponder

346
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,519
to provide a three-year trial generation

347
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,760
in the information

348
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,360
related to this

349
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,120
regenerator group

350
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,240
we provide also an attribute that is

351
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,120
used

352
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,519
for part computation

353
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,880
to express preference between one to the

354
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,040
the group to the other

355
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,839
uh

356
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,839
they there are no constraint uh in the

357
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,600
among transponder belonging to the same

358
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,279
group

359
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,480
that means that any transceiver

360
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,839
belonging to the group can be connected

361
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,639
with any other transceiver

362
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,720
belonging at the same group

363
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,600
obviously provided that you connected

364
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,920
bound ltp with outbound ltp

365
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,360
the group

366
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,240
is

367
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,639
basically characterized by

368
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,920
hardware

369
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,600
characteristics

370
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,959
that is not provided that is is done at

371
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,279
the northbound interface

372
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,839
and that the controller can be reduced

373
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,120
for

374
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,959
for example

375
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,160
at the sbi level but not needed to

376
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,839
provide the

377
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,560
physical characteristics

378
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,160
at the northbound interface

379
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,240
we plan

380
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,600
to add

381
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,839
the next version some text

382
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,440
characterizing some specific example of

383
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,079
configuration for these

384
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,639
these cases

385
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,040
next

386
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,399
okay so

387
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,599
basically uh what we made is that

388
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,280
these are basically the the two uh case

389
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,000
so

390
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,559
uh in the in the picture uh in the

391
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,520
middle

392
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,240
uh there is example in which we have

393
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,359
four transponder that is belonging at

394
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,039
the same group

395
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,160
and is the case in which uh

396
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,919
all the the transponder is belonging

397
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,679
uh

398
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,480
so the the the orange oval is

399
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,640
representing

400
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,400
the fact that all the four groups

401
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,080
are

402
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,720
belonging at the same hardware device

403
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,600
in the bottom of the picture uh we have

404
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,919
the case in which

405
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:52,960
they

406
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,320
transponder are not all belonging

407
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,600
at

408
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,720
the same hardware device and we have two

409
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,760
oval

410
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,799
orange

411
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,760
but

412
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,039
uh since the the the two groups

413
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,760
uh so the the two device

414
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,160
at which uh uh belonging that the uh

415
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,440
two transponder

416
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,080
are

417
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,600
considered

418
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,200
as

419
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,919
the same group because there is an

420
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,799
external cable that is

421
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,799
providing connectivity

422
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,360
and so this is the reason for the blue

423
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,280
oval that represent the logical group

424
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,640
that

425
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,320
is

426
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,440
is encompassing all together uh the

427
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,160
different responders so

428
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,039
for norbound interfaces application

429
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,679
there is no difference between these two

430
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,400
type of examples so the full

431
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
hardware device

432
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,520
uh

433
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,000
common device or

434
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,160
two different device belong is some

435
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
transponder but

436
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,360
uh

437
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,320
this the the cable that is connecting

438
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,520
the two

439
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,840
so

440
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,039
next

441
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,480
okay so

442
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,400
this is the solution in the young so we

443
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,679
provide

444
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,000
the description of this regenerator

445
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,039
group

446
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,240
with the specific identifier for the

447
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,280
group

448
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,840
the

449
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,360
attribute considering the

450
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,200
way of uh how to

451
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,600
solve the preference in the port

452
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,080
computation between different group

453
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,420
and the

454
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,799
[Applause]

455
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,520
the pointer to the transponder that is

456
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,039
belonging at this group

457
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,120
next

458
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,880
another

459
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,880
big topic that

460
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,440
we solve is related to the 7-2 issue

461
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,360
so basically the model is providing full

462
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,440
flexibility

463
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,880
full flexibility in sense that a tunnel

464
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,760
termination point can host

465
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,840
one or more transceiver

466
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,840
that can be belong also to one or more

467
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,440
transponder

468
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,559
and the model does not preclude also the

469
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,840
fact that ttp tunnel termination point

470
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,200
can point to

471
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,039
[Music]

472
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,679
can be pointed to the same transponder

473
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,440
but

474
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,280
as

475
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,039
the in the model

476
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,080
we use the construct of the local link

477
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,280
connectivity list to express

478
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,159
the add drop path impairments in the

479
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,000
roadm while we use connectivity matrix

480
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,039
for the express part the issue in the

481
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,000
local link connectivity list is that

482
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,720
what is permitted it is just to have one

483
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,840
entry

484
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,919
for any uh tunnel termination point ltp

485
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,080
pair that in our case ltp represented

486
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,720
the port of the addrop

487
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,840
part of the rodent

488
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,080
so

489
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,200
they

490
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,600
what we we adjust

491
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,200
with this update is that now

492
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,880
the model is

493
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,360
is flexible enough

494
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,360
to describe

495
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,240
the case in which also different

496
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,799
optical impairments

497
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,200
are needed for a transceiver that

498
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,600
belonging at the same

499
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,799
entry for ttp ltp

500
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,120
in the local link connectivity list

501
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,360
next slide

502
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,480
here is

503
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,000
on the left is one of the examples

504
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,600
other examples

505
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,360
are in the github in the presentation

506
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,880
that i i

507
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,880
i mention here the title

508
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,400
we have here

509
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,159
one transponder with four transceiver

510
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,960
all the four transceiver are connected

511
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,840
at the same

512
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,760
local

513
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,880
ltp

514
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,080
so the same port of the other

515
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,960
part of the road

516
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,720
that

517
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,760
we can

518
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,400
make naming a nominal ltp1 so all four

519
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,960
transceiver uh are connected to the ltp1

520
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,919
uh

521
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,120
if

522
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,600
we hypothesize that there are not the

523
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,400
same impairments between the different

524
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,320
uh

525
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,840
between the

526
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,240
four uh transceiver

527
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,360
uh

528
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,720
and so we would have

529
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,320
four different set of optical impairment

530
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,679
uh for each direction in one entry of

531
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,159
the local link connectivity

532
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,840
uh while the the the

533
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,080
the standard definition the local link

534
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,439
connectivity permit only one set of

535
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,080
for for each direction this is the

536
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,200
problem

537
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,159
and

538
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,000
to solve that

539
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,960
on the right part of the picture

540
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,280
we introduced

541
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,400
a list

542
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,440
of possible transceiver with

543
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,000
let me say differentiation with respect

544
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,640
the default

545
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,480
that uh this list uh has to be added in

546
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,360
the

547
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,520
local link connectivity

548
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,440
entry uh and uh

549
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,600
in in the in for any uh part of

550
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,000
represent in any element of this

551
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,120
list

552
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,320
you can

553
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,559
add specific

554
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,400
part impairments

555
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,320
optical impairments

556
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,000
specifying detail for this specific

557
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,360
transceiver

558
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,279
and this sold the issue so you can have

559
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,200
one entry but

560
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,000
in the entry we can specify different

561
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,440
impairments in the case you needed

562
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,480
for any transceiver

563
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,880
next

564
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,279
okay

565
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,600
here

566
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,159
we i added the uh

567
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,760
basic other uh issue that we solve with

568
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,440
the enhancement

569
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,880
in the model

570
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,760
so

571
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,559
we added the information

572
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,520
regarding geolocation of amplifier

573
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,520
and

574
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,200
we added

575
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,159
the possibility to identify otsi in a

576
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,360
reverse

577
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,840
direction

578
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,240
next

579
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,480
we uh added also in the model the

580
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,520
possibility in the um

581
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,919
for any oms

582
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,200
um to associate

583
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,320
any uh in in the oms link

584
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,000
to associate

585
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,960
a unidirectional link

586
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,080
in case of a parallel link between two

587
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,720
nodes so to associate one link to the

588
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,200
other to understand that

589
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,400
belong at the same

590
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,200
at the same oms part

591
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,600
and to associate also the oms element in

592
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,200
the reverse direction for example

593
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,120
the same amplifier in the direction

594
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
in the in the

595
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,960
both direction related to a

596
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,520
bi-directional part of the ums

597
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,840
next

598
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,559
so the here

599
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,360
i

600
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,799
provided

601
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,919
the

602
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,120
situation of the open issue

603
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,799
we have uh uh

604
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,039
you can see the the link to our github

605
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,600
which is provided discussion and

606
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,360
situation of the issue

607
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,159
we solve the twelfth issue uh

608
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,200
after

609
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,640
uh itf 111 and we have seen a still 16

610
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,000
open issue

611
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,640
but for the moment we have just the two

612
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,640
pending young model enhancement that

613
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,440
we

614
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,760
need still need to

615
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,880
add

616
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,320
and basically we have a

617
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,240
five review terminology uh that is still

618
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,480
needed it

619
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,559
and this anyway is the situation of

620
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:30,080
any issue that is still remain in the

621
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,520
in the

622
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
drafts

623
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,840
next

624
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,159
so next step

625
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,440
obviously we wanted to address

626
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,159
the issue that remain open

627
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,240
uh both uh regarding the enhancement

628
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,919
that we need to have

629
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,360
uh that at the moment to issue uh

630
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,399
regarding the model and the editorial

631
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,520
part

632
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,240
uh we would like to be ready for young

633
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,559
doctor review

634
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,679
and

635
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,120
we hope to

636
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,679
have the possibility to have a stable

637
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,480
version i mean and for stable version

638
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,039
means that we have a model that is

639
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:19,039
supporting all the basic features that

640
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:19,919
we

641
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,760
consider

642
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,120
and an alignment in the terminology

643
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,679
and this

644
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:28,799
we hope

645
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:29,840
by

646
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,600
next itf

647
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,480
that

648
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,200
we also but that it could be also in

649
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,720
person but

650
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,120
let's see

651
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,159
okay

652
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,760
okay any comments oh there's just one

653
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,640
slide about back up oh no okay would you

654
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,360
like to introduce the backup last minute

655
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,720
now this is backup just to

656
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,240
provide

657
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,279
again

658
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,399
uh

659
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,919
the picture related to the

660
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,159
reference configuration

661
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,960
uh for uh 3r

662
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,000
and

663
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,960
the usage of the other slide the local

664
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,600
link connectivity that as i said

665
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,919
is used to provide a

666
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,679
drop

667
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,520
impairment in the case of uh

668
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,640
for rodent so this is just as reference

669
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,360
in the case you need

670
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,240
clarification

671
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,600
okay thank you sergio

672
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,840
any comments

673
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,360
let me return back to the

674
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,679
no comments

675
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,399
so i i have just one minor comment from

676
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,520
my side

677
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,720
so regarding the next step uh

678
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,880
you know uh since there are still you

679
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,960
know a couple of

680
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,320
uh open issues to be fixed so um

681
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,360
i would kindly suggest we send this uh

682
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,520
draft for young doctor review once these

683
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
open issues are fixed

684
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,840
is that okay for you

685
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,080
yes yeah at least

686
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,679
well

687
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,080
for young daughter review the need is

688
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,480
this to to fix the young part so i

689
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,799
suppose that this can be

690
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,480
yeah

691
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,080
can be feasible

692
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,679
uh

693
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,000
in the in a good time frame

694
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,760
okay thank you yeah any other comments

695
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,480
from the frog

696
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,000
none okay good

697
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,120
and then let's move to the uh

698
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,080
presentation too

699
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,399
okay it's still for you sergio yes

700
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,399
uh okay um

701
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,799
okay i'm going also to

702
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,880
present the update for the layer zero

703
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,559
type extension

704
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,360
that i said before by daniele

705
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,240
is representing the

706
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,279
layer 0 extension

707
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,600
providing all the information related to

708
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,720
the transponder part that has been

709
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,960
put out of the layer 0 type now that is

710
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,399
became

711
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,559
rfc

712
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,120
next slide

713
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,880
so

714
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,679
this this draft has been was adopted as

715
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,519
a working group

716
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,840
draft

717
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,240
in in in august

718
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,919
and there was a meter 0-0 version

719
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,519
the update that we provide at this time

720
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,679
is basically

721
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,519
related to

722
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,559
an issue that is coming from

723
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,279
optical impairment topology model that

724
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,720
is the issue 42 regarding the minimum

725
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,360
channel spacing parameters

726
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,039
uh

727
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,399
that

728
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,639
and

729
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,799
this uh

730
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:37,840
issue

731
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,360
uh is being uh is brought

732
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,480
together

733
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,799
some

734
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,640
some modification in the layer zero type

735
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,240
extension

736
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,880
so we need to move

737
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,159
to remove the otsi carrier bandwidth and

738
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,039
nyquist spacing factor

739
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,200
we added the

740
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,679
new definition of minimum carrier

741
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,000
spacing and

742
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,960
and

743
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,440
we clarify names and description

744
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,840
of some parameters

745
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,320
the minimum central frequency max

746
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,640
central frequency and central frequency

747
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,760
step

748
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,799
to be aligned with the text that is

749
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,399
providing the

750
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,240
section 2.5 to the 4

751
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,600
of the

752
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,039
optical impairment drafts so

753
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,399
this is basically the

754
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,799
update uh next

755
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:42,880
uh

756
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,080
for uh

757
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,200
next step

758
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,720
uh

759
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,080
we

760
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,320
need to add the other young structure

761
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,399
as needed

762
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,200
always with the intent of sharing the

763
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,039
same yak structure

764
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,679
among a different layer zero young model

765
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,120
in c camp

766
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,840
[Music]

767
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,559
and

768
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,000
waiting f

769
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,520
uh to

770
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,199
incorporate

771
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,000
uh

772
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,199
the update from the layer zero type

773
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,960
uh now that

774
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,599
is uh has been published

775
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,520
as rfc

776
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,520
9093

777
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,159
as

778
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,918
we provide

779
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,399
and we foreseen in the basic

780
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,440
plan for the layer 0 type extension so

781
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,560
to

782
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,199
incorporate immediately the update that

783
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,199
is coming from layer 0 type as soon as

784
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,480
it become

785
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,480
rfc

786
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,720
i finish from my side

787
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,960
okay thank you sergio

788
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,680
so any comments

789
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,279
no comments

790
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,440
so yeah there's no comments from the

791
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,520
floor i have one

792
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,640
okay please

793
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,720
uh yes

794
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,440
i'm trying to help but uh uh i'd like to

795
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,880
clarify

796
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,480
uh regarding the

797
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,119
layer zero types extension

798
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,079
what is the expectation of this basic

799
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,079
model supporting the other

800
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,680
document for example we understand that

801
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,599
it will be supporting the optical

802
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,000
impairment topology young module

803
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,839
do we have other media devices for

804
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,400
example the flex grade the anthology

805
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,280
or

806
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,680
others

807
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,119
i don't know if it's just my problem but

808
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,079
your voice is up and down

809
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,680
and so i didn't get your your question

810
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,560
frankly speaking

811
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,480
oh let me repeat and try again uh

812
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,520
uh the question is what is a

813
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,320
uh

814
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,119
a target

815
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,920
document for the layer zero uh

816
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,200
i mean we cannot hear you clearly

817
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,839
hello

818
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,160
oh maybe uh how mean the connectivity is

819
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,800
not good so let me ask her

820
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,800
one more comment

821
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,320
so at the

822
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,440
next step the second uh says uh you know

823
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,800
this

824
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,000
this draft or fcv2

825
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,040
to b

826
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,560
will incorporate

827
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,839
updates from fc uh you know or v1 or

828
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,680
layer 0 types

829
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,599
so uh for me it seems that rfc v1 will

830
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:20,880
be

831
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,400
obsoleted by rcv2 right rather than just

832
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,839
updated by uh updated by rcr

833
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,760
uh

834
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,280
we we too

835
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,920
so i mean uh so we would like to we i

836
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,680
think we should think about which

837
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,119
category or

838
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,280
either update or

839
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,960
obsolete should be used

840
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,640
if i've see a v2

841
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,280
obsolete rcv1

842
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,680
and the documents relationship should

843
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,160
also be on the flash like this page

844
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,599
backup you know our information

845
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,240
so i'm i think maybe we should you know

846
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,960
have more investigation and you know

847
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,839
think about which kind of category to be

848
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,160
used

849
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
okay

850
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,680
you mean category related to

851
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,000
what type of

852
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,839
draft name this is what you right you're

853
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,079
saying

854
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,440
right

855
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,079
and and then you know yeah you can look

856
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,240
at one chapter you know i've seen 22 23

857
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,839
in this draft it divides the

858
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,920
terminologies on update and obsolete

859
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,320
you know

860
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,960
so maybe we can also get some you know

861
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,440
input or feedback from agent because i

862
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,680
think he know more things than us

863
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,000
sure

864
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,560
so the intent at the end you remember is

865
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,520
that

866
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,200
we should have

867
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,119
let me say a

868
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,200
version 2 of layer 0 type rfc

869
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,000
that incorporate everything this is the

870
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,200
last step

871
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,040
as soon as

872
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,240
if you look at the my background backup

873
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,280
slides of the presentation that there

874
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,119
was the famous

875
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,160
flow

876
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
of information

877
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,040
the last step should be this one was

878
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,640
that

879
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,320
layer 0 type extension has incorporated

880
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,880
all the

881
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,280
update from

882
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,839
layer 0

883
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,040
type as

884
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,359
us today in the sense that

885
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,320
isa became rfc

886
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,520
this is

887
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,400
the intention

888
00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:01,119
okay but you know in the fc 22 23

889
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,560
it defines the update and obsolete

890
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,040
for the updates it says to be used as a

891
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,680
reference from a new item that cannot be

892
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,599
used that long

893
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,880
to reference the previous document

894
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,079
but for the obsolete it says to be used

895
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,200
to reference to an early document

896
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,720
that is replaced by this document so

897
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,839
if your

898
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,400
you know our intention is to incu

899
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,599
incorporate updates from the leo 0 types

900
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,880
which means that

901
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,760
after v2 will cover everything from the

902
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,560
you know layer 2 types you know so i

903
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,720
mean so in this way maybe we can think

904
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,280
of about if we should use the update or

905
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,920
obsolete

906
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,040
the tie

907
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,839
yeah

908
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,520
please yeah am i allowed to speak

909
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,040
yeah thank you thank you

910
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,720
yeah my understanding is actually that

911
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,680
that the the young model extensions

912
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,920
we're currently defining are actually

913
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,560
adding to the existing uh

914
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,880
layer zero types which are published in

915
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,960
rfc 1993 now and in my opinion

916
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,400
if the

917
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,560
new model with the extensions will be

918
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,359
published that should actually replace

919
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,240
um the old or the previous version of

920
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,319
player zero types that means that it

921
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,960
obsoletes that rfc in 1993 that's my

922
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,319
opinion

923
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,359
okay

924
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,200
yeah it's also my understanding

925
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,520
so if you if

926
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,319
if you know uh

927
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,040
data and and and my understanding is

928
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,880
correct and then which the changes are

929
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,280
you know our category of job c and we

930
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,680
should use the obsolete naught and

931
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,800
update

932
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,800
maybe we can double check anyway right

933
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,640
yeah

934
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,079
sure

935
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,240
okay

936
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,839
okay any other comments

937
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,680
yes hi um yeah um just a quick comment

938
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,359
on the um the next steps uh when

939
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,160
designing the layer zero types extension

940
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,520
uh groupings

941
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,680
we should also keep in mind that

942
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,160
it needs to support

943
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,920
other models like the tunnel models as

944
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,560
well as new models like optical path

945
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,000
computation

946
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,079
basically all the groupings needs to be

947
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,359
carefully designed

948
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,200
to to

949
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,359
to allow

950
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,319
sharing

951
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:38,279
between different models

952
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,760
okay

953
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,520
let's move to the project

954
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,359
so sorry are you going to uh respond

955
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,119
no no uh i agree in the sense that

956
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,800
surely the the

957
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,599
intention of the of the draft is clear

958
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,359
it's to host

959
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:17,280
a common structure that can be used by

960
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,520
different uh

961
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,680
layer zero uh

962
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,640
layer zero model young model so

963
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,760
yeah if there is other other uh

964
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,160
draft that is coming uh

965
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,079
it's true that

966
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,160
uh the the

967
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,760
the document has to uh

968
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,560
to be used in the contest also of these

969
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,279
new drafts

970
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,920
okay yeah thank you maybe italo wanted

971
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,920
to

972
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,560
italo is there

973
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,200
italo please

974
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,839
quick comment i think if you want to

975
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,640
make it clear that we are replacing 1993

976
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,079
what we can do now is we can

977
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,800
stretch restructure the draft as being a

978
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,599
1993 b draft and rename the draft as

979
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,480
well so we can make it more clear that

980
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,520
that's where we are going

981
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,440
yeah okay

982
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,680
okay

983
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,599
okay

984
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,560
thank you let's move to our presentation

985
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,560
three

986
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,520
press create young models

987
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,720
mr dan hi guys

988
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,839
hi hi mister

989
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,720
uh

990
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,400
you can hear me okay

991
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,680
excellent so thanks guys just a

992
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,079
short update on our flexigrid efforts uh

993
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,680
you might have seen

994
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,400
some

995
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,800
um some emails to the c camp list

996
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,800
earlier today that was uh me submitting

997
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,119
a new document

998
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,520
so one of the things that we've been

999
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,599
sort of doing with our flexigrid work is

1000
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:18,800
trying to

1001
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,000
harmonize

1002
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,560
uh something up some of our naming

1003
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,599
and

1004
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,640
one thing that we noticed with the

1005
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,760
the previous media channel document so

1006
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,160
that was the yang data model for

1007
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,160
flexigrid media channels

1008
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,240
is that that wasn't a sort of consistent

1009
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,359
name with

1010
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,599
some of the other documents in ccamp

1011
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,960
such as the wsom tunnel document so

1012
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,520
we just updated the name and

1013
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,640
it was sort of dependent actually on the

1014
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,880
[Music]

1015
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,760
the chairs just authorizing

1016
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,040
that

1017
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,200
this new document a young data model for

1018
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,480
flexigrid

1019
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,040
tunnels replaces

1020
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,800
the document a young data model for

1021
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,200
flexi grid media channels so

1022
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,520
sorry if you just saw that email earlier

1023
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,359
but that's the change

1024
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,240
next slide please

1025
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,400
cool so uh the first uh documents that

1026
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,800
i'm briefly going to talk about is our

1027
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,640
sort of optical topology document for

1028
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,040
flexigrid networks

1029
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,880
this is now in uh it's version 11 um

1030
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,720
incarnation and this was the document

1031
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,240
that was submitted a couple of hours ago

1032
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,160
and it now points to our new tunnel

1033
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,040
document and we've also updated

1034
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,200
the terminology within the document so

1035
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,119
essentially sort of replacing media

1036
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,319
channel um with tunnel although we we do

1037
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,319
explain what a tunnel is in fact it is a

1038
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,920
media channel

1039
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,200
we have uh addressed just a few sort of

1040
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,160
open issues uh since the last ietf but

1041
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,400
essentially it's it's now stable

1042
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,640
um the code is stable

1043
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,040
it is ready for um sort of a review from

1044
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,640
the working group so we would like to

1045
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,720
enter this document into uh working

1046
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,240
group last call

1047
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,960
you may have thought that it

1048
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,760
it had a yang doctor review which it has

1049
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,400
that was an early review

1050
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,920
so we will now hope that uh the working

1051
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,440
group is ready to kind of take a look at

1052
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,480
this and

1053
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,640
let us know if there's anything obvious

1054
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,760
or major

1055
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,920
that needs to be addressed otherwise we

1056
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,240
can sort of progress this through the uh

1057
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,640
the isg and the sort of the rfc process

1058
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,000
next slide please

1059
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,160
so we're now going to focus on our

1060
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,240
tunnel document

1061
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,839
this is typically something that we talk

1062
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:52,400
about uh

1063
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,559
on a weekly call and i've posted the

1064
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,520
cool details to the mailing list

1065
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,440
they are also available i think at the

1066
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,359
end of the slide deck that we've got

1067
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,839
today so anyone is welcome

1068
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,040
when we have sort of substantive

1069
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,599
points that we want to raise or there

1070
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:10,480
are

1071
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,359
your specific options that we

1072
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,559
you you we need to agree or discard yeah

1073
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,640
we will take these to the list so don't

1074
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,960
think of these kind of calls that we're

1075
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,559
having as

1076
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,800
sort of um circumnavigating working

1077
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,680
group process we will absolutely

1078
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,440
liaise with the working group

1079
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,440
um when it comes to sort of making key

1080
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,079
decisions um and post those to the list

1081
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,400
or or obviously highlight them during

1082
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,160
our presentations

1083
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,720
what's changed um in our in our most

1084
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,440
recent document i hear you cry well uh

1085
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,240
we've updated the prefix now again that

1086
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,160
was an ongoing discussion that we had

1087
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,839
sort of prior really to itf 111 and it

1088
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:56,400
sort of just bled over um post ietf111

1089
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,760
so those that

1090
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,559
those have been updated you will notice

1091
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,440
as well if you've checked out the um the

1092
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,160
current code of the document

1093
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,200
that we've uh ripped out the

1094
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,920
uh rpc function for the path computation

1095
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,000
uh specifically for flexi grid in this

1096
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,440
case that is now a new uh document and a

1097
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,920
new piece of code which will be

1098
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,880
uh discussed a little bit later today i

1099
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,240
think um

1100
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,599
now

1101
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,040
we found actually that this was um

1102
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,160
i think a useful uh exercise uh and i'm

1103
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,960
sure um i were atari will explain that

1104
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,440
sort of rationale a little bit later

1105
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,280
um there has been some sort of minor um

1106
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,680
code changes as well um just sort of

1107
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,240
fixing some compilation errors because

1108
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,720
we're heavily dependent of course on uh

1109
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,359
some of the other documents that uh the

1110
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,839
c camp group are working on

1111
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,359
uh things like

1112
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,119
gosh what are we yeah so

1113
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,720
the the yangti model the topology model

1114
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,040
uh and so on and so forth in fact it's

1115
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,160
probably

1116
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:04,880
the

1117
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,599
uh flexi grid topology document

1118
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,200
uh as well is is kind of linked uh to

1119
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,839
things like impairment topology uh as

1120
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,520
well so there are a lot of dependencies

1121
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,040
between these documents when something

1122
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,680
changes if it affects us then of course

1123
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,839
we need to update that as well

1124
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:25,480
next slide please

1125
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,640
so what what what would we like sort of

1126
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,720
the working group to consider you know

1127
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,319
potentially help with

1128
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,760
well we we've

1129
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,240
sort of narrowed some of the discussion

1130
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,640
and the applicability really the scope

1131
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,720
of you how we're going to use this model

1132
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,559
and what we're using it for

1133
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,480
uh so this is kind of really important

1134
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,240
for uh next generation optical

1135
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,920
technology it's not you know designed

1136
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,680
for some of the legacy

1137
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,440
optical equipment so we've sort of

1138
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,400
clarified that now in the document there

1139
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,200
are um sort of ongoing discussions with

1140
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,599
things like sort of operational issues

1141
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,319
specifically the otsi and and and how

1142
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,359
that's

1143
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,359
actually used

1144
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:10,559
for uh sort of setting up our

1145
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,559
our um our tunnels

1146
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,960
i think of course the otsi issues being

1147
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,040
raised uh in some of the other um ids as

1148
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,079
well

1149
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,319
so we've we've kind of linked um the

1150
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,480
otsi discussion

1151
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,440
uh

1152
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,760
from those other conversations

1153
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,119
uh with

1154
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,400
and that's specifically i think the

1155
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,720
impairment top topology document so

1156
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,040
we've linked that with uh our flexi grip

1157
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,200
tunnel document

1158
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,160
we found actually um it's useful to have

1159
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,480
it was one of the review um sort of

1160
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,480
observations that we had when we had a

1161
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,200
sort of routing area review of of

1162
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,880
another document that it's good to

1163
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,720
explain how this

1164
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,960
model is used in the context of other

1165
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,520
models uh and just just as sort of early

1166
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,960
in the document rather than having to

1167
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,800
kind of delve into the yan code itself

1168
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,960
to see what's augmented or extended uh

1169
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,280
we just explained at a high level um

1170
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,200
very early in the document

1171
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,640
there are actually sort of more um

1172
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,079
open issues

1173
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,839
on the order of probably sort of 10 open

1174
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:13,760
issues including things like

1175
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,480
some simple things in theory at least

1176
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,559
we've got too many document authors

1177
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,720
in fact it's really anyone who showed

1178
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,000
any kind of interest and actually

1179
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,319
commented or provided text has been

1180
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,319
included as an author which meant we've

1181
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:27,599
gone beyond

1182
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,800
uh the recommended or mandated number so

1183
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,200
that that needs to be resolved as well

1184
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,760
and you can find all of these uh open

1185
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,760
issues on our sort of c camp uh github

1186
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,760
repository which which i will talk to

1187
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,920
deta i think we will need to change now

1188
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,760
because it refers to media channel

1189
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,760
rather than sort of uh place your grid

1190
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,559
tunnel i think that's an easy change

1191
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,800
that we can do within github next slide

1192
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,119
please

1193
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,359
so um finally

1194
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:00,400
the

1195
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,920
sort of another observation that was

1196
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,559
made on on our recent call

1197
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,480
is well we've got the we've got the

1198
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,200
flexi grid topology so great i can

1199
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,880
export uh information about my flex grid

1200
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,079
transport network uh from um sort of my

1201
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,319
physical devices

1202
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:21,520
uh we've got our optical inventory uh

1203
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,200
document as well so there's your

1204
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,559
potentially additional information

1205
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,359
that's not online or or available to be

1206
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,000
queried or things that are online but

1207
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,200
aren't sort of distributed in the

1208
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,280
traffic engineering database

1209
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,440
uh we've got the flexigrid media channel

1210
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,119
documents

1211
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,599
and model for actually setting up the

1212
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,280
connection

1213
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,839
but what about things like sort of

1214
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:47,119
operational aspects uh and and

1215
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,880
this this is quite it's kind of

1216
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,800
interesting because in the in the itf we

1217
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,640
always get excited about sort of new

1218
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,839
technology

1219
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:56,319
uh control plane or forwarding behavior

1220
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,640
um or at least how to set up and manage

1221
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,359
it

1222
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,599
uh we often sort of

1223
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,760
think about the operational and even

1224
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,200
some of the security aspects as kind of

1225
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,359
a bit of an afterthought although we are

1226
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,960
supposed to have sections specifically

1227
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,960
that sort of cover these

1228
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,839
so i've just sort of just raised an

1229
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:15,920
issue within github just something we

1230
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,000
need to be thinking about is

1231
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,280
um if we set up our flexi grid transport

1232
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,960
network um what about um you know once

1233
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,880
we've got our connections set up as well

1234
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,640
how do we how do we monitor them how do

1235
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,240
we troubleshoot them

1236
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,119
um

1237
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,520
and yes i know that we've got other

1238
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,160
documents within ccamp which aren't

1239
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,119
actually being presented um in this

1240
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:40,720
session so i'll follow up with the

1241
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,359
authors uh so so there are things like

1242
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:44,319
the

1243
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,640
optical interface parameters document

1244
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,079
there are the

1245
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:51,040
client signal and performance monitoring

1246
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,720
documents as well and i'm just kind of

1247
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,400
mindful that maybe we need to be looking

1248
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,319
at these and thinking about some of this

1249
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:59,040
work and and its context of flexi grid

1250
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,160
as well and

1251
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,000
and making sure that we were actually

1252
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,040
able to not only set up uh our

1253
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,359
infrastructure create services but

1254
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:08,559
actually monitor and manage those

1255
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,400
services as well so that's another sort

1256
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,160
of area we'll be uh investigating

1257
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,920
thank you i think that's everything i

1258
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,760
wanted to say next slide oh there's

1259
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,520
maybe another slide

1260
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,400
this the last one

1261
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,359
no okay i lied i deleted it great

1262
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,078
any questions

1263
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,759
yeah thank you then any questions

1264
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,839
any comments

1265
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,319
no comments no question

1266
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:55,200
no nothing no no one's no one's awake

1267
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,040
yeah

1268
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,160
i think for the first document uh which

1269
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,960
is about desperate topology

1270
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,599
i think it's quite stable right and so

1271
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,480
maybe we can think about you know move

1272
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,440
forward his job

1273
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,400
yes please

1274
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,400
yeah

1275
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,359
this time

1276
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,319
yes we can hear you help me

1277
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,240
yeah i'm trying to uh clarify a little

1278
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,559
bit about the last page where you

1279
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:40,640
will talk about the site discussion on

1280
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,319
operational aspects so this would be

1281
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,400
greatly appreciated and needed

1282
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,799
but i believe this is not needed only

1283
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:49,440
for flex grid networks so

1284
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,839
i'm trying to understand are we putting

1285
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:52,720
uh

1286
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,559
the same functionality for example

1287
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,400
performance monitoring for

1288
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,960
for every kind of potential

1289
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,920
networks or we are doing this per

1290
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,920
switching technology

1291
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,720
so i would rather prefer doing this

1292
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,440
together instead of

1293
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,960
only discussing with

1294
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,599
yes that that is actually a really good

1295
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,440
point and i'm all i kind of feel the

1296
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,960
presence of lou berger here as well

1297
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,240
saying you know don't don't make this

1298
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,160
technology specific you know this can be

1299
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,920
generalized and applied to multiple

1300
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,920
technologies we can save time and

1301
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,920
people's effort so that's a really good

1302
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,599
point i will

1303
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,760
i'll definitely do that where possible

1304
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:38,160
okay yeah thank you

1305
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,640
so let's move to uh next

1306
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,119
microwave

1307
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:55,839
i think uh this force got

1308
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,680
yes i is uh voice check here

1309
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,720
it sounds like it looks like i'm coming

1310
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,110
through i see the little

1311
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:05,760
[Music]

1312
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,680
graph that my voice is coming through so

1313
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,440
uh welcome thanks

1314
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,720
uh chairs and uh welcome to the ccap

1315
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,480
working group this is the first time

1316
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,240
you've heard about this one in a while

1317
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,040
so

1318
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,000
we felt that it was time to provide a

1319
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,520
update on the microwave topology yang

1320
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,720
data model

1321
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,680
there is a version 2 draft that's

1322
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,680
available and you can see a couple links

1323
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,760
there ones to the data tracker and once

1324
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,240
to our brand new github that we're

1325
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,720
trying to migrate to so we can track

1326
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,960
issues and those types of things

1327
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,559
so you can also see the authors

1328
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,440
on

1329
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,520
this page too so go to this next slide

1330
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,839
please

1331
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,240
so i'll take you through some of the

1332
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,240
things that we've done so our status is

1333
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,440
that

1334
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,960
um we've

1335
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,119
separated the modeling out so we now

1336
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:59,119
have modeling of radio links and

1337
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,280
carriers as separate link entities that

1338
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,960
was something that was

1339
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,359
modified since version one

1340
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:08,720
and then we also have added a couple of

1341
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,559
additional modules so

1342
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,480
our

1343
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,720
draft has a topology module in it that

1344
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,960
is an extension of the te topology model

1345
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,400
and uh the ietfte topology model and

1346
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,400
then in order to make it even more

1347
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,040
generic we separated out a bandwidth

1348
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,079
availability as a separate augmentation

1349
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:34,000
and also how

1350
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:34,960
the

1351
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,200
traffic engineer or how the microwave

1352
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,119
model can be linked back to interfaces

1353
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,119
and so that's a separate module and

1354
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:45,839
augmentation as well so if you just want

1355
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:48,880
microwave topology modeling you can do

1356
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,960
you can use one of the modules if you

1357
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,200
need bandwidth availability you can add

1358
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,440
that one and if you want to link it to a

1359
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,000
interface in a

1360
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,200
ietf stance you can use the uh interface

1361
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,640
topology so

1362
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,799
we wanted to bring this up as something

1363
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:06,799
that that we're working on and see if

1364
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:09,280
there are others that like this kind of

1365
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,839
of separation and modularization so

1366
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:17,200
going on to the next slide

1367
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,359
we'll get into some of the more details

1368
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:20,880
around

1369
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,440
next slide

1370
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,119
can you hear me

1371
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,440
hello

1372
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,060
hello

1373
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,920
[Music]

1374
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,599
we can hear you scott

1375
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,359
right i need i need to go to the next

1376
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,440
slide if they switch slides because i

1377
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,599
don't see a slide has been changed i'm

1378
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,359
still on this step

1379
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:49,359
yeah

1380
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:51,200
i'm sorry yeah i hear you and it sounds

1381
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,640
like other people hear you but maybe if

1382
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,079
a tai doesn't hear you if i tire you

1383
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,799
maybe because that seems to be the uh so

1384
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:58,799
maybe i should just put next slide in

1385
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,880
the

1386
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:05,000
chat window how about that

1387
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,200
yeah i think that might be the

1388
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,160
uh the issue

1389
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,960
anybody know if there's a uh

1390
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,640
yeah

1391
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,839
screen sharing is frozen

1392
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:29,040
and

1393
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,119
the screen is gone

1394
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:33,680
okay so do you want me to i can download

1395
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,240
my presentation and we have a call from

1396
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,960
he is rejoining but

1397
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,599
i don't know uh scott if you can share

1398
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,760
the screen without his authentication

1399
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,960
from the chair well let's see i can i

1400
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,960
yeah i don't know if i can or not so

1401
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,440
i can try

1402
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,319
uh is there uh

1403
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,400
we could all click along on the meeting

1404
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,119
materials but that's pretty clunky

1405
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:03,200
right so

1406
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,200
cherries

1407
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,479
yes

1408
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,039
uh are you able to either share the

1409
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:12,240
slides or

1410
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,810
authorize scott to share his screen

1411
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:16,720
[Music]

1412
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,200
yeah let me bring you ask for permission

1413
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,359
i'll allow you

1414
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:24,160
okay let me download my slides real

1415
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,480
quick

1416
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,640
okay

1417
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:36,559
so if i click on that

1418
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,280
if you just raised your hand but did you

1419
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,559
get up on the

1420
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:46,079
i clicked on the thing next to my hand

1421
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:48,079
okay well here you also showed up in the

1422
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:49,599
queue but

1423
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,150
oh well yeah

1424
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:52,559
[Music]

1425
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,880
interesting

1426
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,280
system

1427
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,640
okay i have

1428
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,359
do i just do uh

1429
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:11,440
presentation view

1430
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,440
maybe

1431
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,440
danielle is uh do you need to do

1432
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,920
anything else on your end or i i do see

1433
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,319
scott's sharing a request there

1434
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:25,359
i think so but i don't see any requests

1435
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:28,880
oh well i'll cancel it and try again

1436
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,799
there i clicked on the uh okay

1437
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,720
there it is decks ready to share so i

1438
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,559
want two shoes

1439
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:40,640
nice

1440
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:41,520
so

1441
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:45,680
where number what number is mine four

1442
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,720
this one oh share

1443
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,680
oh look at that now i was having some

1444
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,799
trouble with people my voice breaking up

1445
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:57,760
when i was displaying slides before is

1446
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,200
is am i still coming through

1447
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:02,880
yes

1448
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,160
okay perfect

1449
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:08,240
um all right so next slide is

1450
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:12,000
oh i already did that one so next slide

1451
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,200
so these are the new generic modules i i

1452
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,039
wanted to provide a little more detail

1453
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:19,440
on this to make it easier to see so

1454
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,440
there's a bandwidth availability

1455
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,839
topology module in this

1456
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:26,319
um uh

1457
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:28,640
yang file and then there's also a

1458
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,119
interface reference topology you can see

1459
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:34,000
the augmentation i stole from the tree

1460
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,559
how it uh adds

1461
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:38,880
yeah how it adds uh

1462
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,760
the capabilities for a bandwidth

1463
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,119
availability and it extends the te

1464
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:46,880
topology model

1465
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,440
and then the same and then for the

1466
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,520
interface we're extending the um

1467
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,480
we're adding the interface name to

1468
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,680
a to the termination point so that

1469
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,480
allows us to uh have our reference to

1470
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,520
our the interface that's uh being used

1471
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,520
for that particular piece of the

1472
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,880
topology

1473
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,200
so that's two generic modules might be

1474
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,880
useful for other people if they like

1475
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,960
that sort of thing

1476
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,079
so

1477
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:19,039
based on our recommendations from teas

1478
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:21,440
we're now basing our module i know this

1479
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,119
is an eye chart so you can click on them

1480
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,640
and zoom in on them if you really want

1481
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,280
to see the trees

1482
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,440
the one of the original

1483
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,400
versions of the microwave topology model

1484
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,200
inherited from or augmented

1485
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,400
the ietf network topology

1486
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,839
and so

1487
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,680
we looked at the

1488
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,440
ietf

1489
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,160
te topology module and thought it was

1490
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,920
complex

1491
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,880
because of how big and overwhelming it

1492
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,680
was but come to find out it wasn't so

1493
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,240
complex because we had people like

1494
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,240
tallow and others on the call being able

1495
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,319
to take us through how most of the

1496
01:06:01,319 --> 01:06:04,599
ietfte topology as described in

1497
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:06,160
87.95

1498
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,640
was designed to be optional

1499
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,520
and also agnostic and to support

1500
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,319
augmentation everywhere so

1501
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:17,440
and the te topology module just as an

1502
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,319
editorial it really isn't just about te

1503
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:22,480
it's really a set of tools that you can

1504
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,760
use to

1505
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,200
augment

1506
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,480
topology and you get the benefit of

1507
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,319
network topology you get the benefit of

1508
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,480
traffic engineering and you get the the

1509
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,559
benefit of

1510
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:37,680
gis stuff so there's various things in

1511
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,680
that module that are useful and the way

1512
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,680
that it's written it's very easy to take

1513
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,480
and modify and use only what you need

1514
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,599
so we created these three augmentations

1515
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:48,880
a um

1516
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,119
augmentation of te topology an

1517
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:53,200
augmentation of termination point and an

1518
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,280
augmentation of te link uh attributes

1519
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,119
so

1520
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:01,839
um we have an example so one thing that

1521
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:03,359
we're trying to do is we're trying to

1522
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,119
leverage some of the tools like yang

1523
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:06,079
lindt

1524
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,039
and and tools like that to

1525
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:13,359
test that our model works and that the

1526
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:15,599
must statements and xpaths and all that

1527
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:16,400
stuff

1528
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:21,200
or right so we created an xml example

1529
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,680
that we then run through

1530
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,720
yanglint and produce a json example

1531
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:30,079
and to validate that uh what we're doing

1532
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:34,000
um hangs together correctly so this is a

1533
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,960
pretty picture of an ascii art picture

1534
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,079
that's in

1535
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:39,440
the draft

1536
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,960
that shows

1537
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,160
what we've done in that so we have a a

1538
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,599
couple nodes

1539
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:48,079
and a couple of

1540
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:49,760
rltps

1541
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,640
and some ctps and you'll see the

1542
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,520
instance diagrams and and the instance

1543
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,280
information in

1544
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,520
json in the draft and

1545
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:02,000
in the 8.2

1546
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,839
so wanted to provide that just to show

1547
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:05,680
that we can use it for regression

1548
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,000
testing and also to test our use cases

1549
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,359
and such

1550
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:11,200
so what's our way forward our way

1551
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,960
forward is

1552
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,839
we have and i i saw and i felt bad

1553
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:18,399
because dan king had an excellent point

1554
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:21,120
on his slides he said when his meetings

1555
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,520
were the thing i forgot to put in here

1556
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,880
is that

1557
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,040
we do have meetings

1558
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,238
every wednesday at 11 a.m

1559
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:32,399
central european time

1560
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:34,960
to discuss this

1561
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,359
with microwave experts so if you're

1562
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:40,000
interested in joining that we share our

1563
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,399
status on the mailing list

1564
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:44,000
and um

1565
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,719
one thing that we're trying to do now is

1566
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,839
get everybody over to using our github

1567
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:52,719
and get the um

1568
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:55,520
issues listed there we're also right now

1569
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,560
trying to convert over to using markdown

1570
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,520
so that we can generate the draft and

1571
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,080
using some of the more modern tools

1572
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,560
and then we want to add some more json

1573
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,719
examples we find those to be very useful

1574
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:10,479
in our discussions to make sure that we

1575
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:13,120
have everything covered and there's also

1576
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,479
some

1577
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:16,960
microwave related

1578
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,520
expertise and questions that we want to

1579
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,198
make sure that we have all of the right

1580
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:24,319
microwave knobs and buttons and dials

1581
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,880
that we need in our in our topology

1582
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,198
module so we're asking for feedback from

1583
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,120
the working group and appreciate your

1584
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,040
time thanks

1585
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,319
i think that was my last one

1586
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:43,759
so i'll turn it back over to

1587
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:46,560
fatai or

1588
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,880
i'm not hearing anybody talk so i mean

1589
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:52,158
if nobody else talks i will continue

1590
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:54,719
there we go

1591
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,120
there i'll do that

1592
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:03,320
thank you yeah any comments

1593
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,199
no comments

1594
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,239
i appreciate your time thank you very

1595
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:23,199
much

1596
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,679
yeah thank you scott yeah

1597
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:28,719
so we have we have done to you know uh

1598
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:31,120
the working groups are the presentations

1599
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,360
on what group documents and then let's

1600
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,520
move to the second you know half of the

1601
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,640
session

1602
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,640
which about do you know in the video

1603
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,080
jobs

1604
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,400
next

1605
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:48,159
one uh which is uh slicing right

1606
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,000
hi juan

1607
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,480
yes can you hear me

1608
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,000
okay yeah

1609
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,040
good

1610
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,880
yeah so um my name is imogo and i'm

1611
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,840
presenting this draft for

1612
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,320
utn advertising on behalf of all the

1613
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,320
authors and courses

1614
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,639
next slide

1615
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,000
okay so

1616
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,239
here are some major updates uh since the

1617
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:18,960
last revision uh we have an expanded

1618
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,199
list of authors and contributors and

1619
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,679
we're welcoming stephan and

1620
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,440
john from channel moba

1621
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,239
um to join us

1622
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:31,840
and over the last

1623
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,440
couple of

1624
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:34,880
months we have

1625
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,760
had some good alignment with the

1626
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,120
peace network slice in particular

1627
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,000
the

1628
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,719
all the discussions within these working

1629
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:45,679
group

1630
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:48,800
um terminologies and definitions on for

1631
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,560
example endpoints and connectivity

1632
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,480
matrices

1633
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,400
these uh

1634
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,880
like also uh are reflected in our

1635
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,360
thoughts uh towards building up the uh

1636
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:02,000
the uh the year model for uh northbound

1637
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,360
interface

1638
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,719
um so uh with this revision we also

1639
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:08,880
added a text

1640
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,840
to describe the design of the

1641
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,199
via model for the otn slicing controller

1642
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:16,480
mbi

1643
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,960
and as well as

1644
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,679
an initial revision of the

1645
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:23,920
northbound interface yeah model

1646
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:24,719
which

1647
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,000
in which we

1648
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,560
try to

1649
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,080
propose a common model that could be

1650
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:35,199
used for transport network slicing

1651
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:37,199
that can support

1652
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:38,320
different

1653
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,840
transport

1654
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,239
network technologies

1655
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,360
and

1656
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,480
this draft also includes a minor updates

1657
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:49,520
to the npiya model and the details can

1658
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,679
will be on the next few slides

1659
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:54,000
next

1660
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,239
okay so for the

1661
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:03,840
otn slice controller npi modeling

1662
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,679
our thoughts is to

1663
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,040
build the

1664
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:12,480
mbi modeling on a common model which

1665
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,280
is technology agnostic and

1666
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:19,239
and importantly to support both

1667
01:13:19,239 --> 01:13:21,679
connectivity-based slices

1668
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:26,080
as well as a resource-based slicing

1669
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,760
by using this model

1670
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,520
it allows

1671
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,800
a user to

1672
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,280
to use connectivity matrix

1673
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,480
to

1674
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,120
express the intended connectivity

1675
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,920
between the endpoints

1676
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,440
but also

1677
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,480
at the same time it could use a topology

1678
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,280
a network topology to

1679
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,159
express the reservation of resources

1680
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:55,600
within the network

1681
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,239
for a particular slice

1682
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:00,960
and also can express uh

1683
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,159
the detailed uh path across the network

1684
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,760
topology

1685
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,040
uh and basically it supports a mode such

1686
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,760
that the resources could be reserved

1687
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,199
with the slice

1688
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:14,480
and then

1689
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,520
the

1690
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,840
connection could be instantiated

1691
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,920
over the the slice

1692
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,320
as the customer needs

1693
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,199
at a later time

1694
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:26,880
so

1695
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,679
with the common model

1696
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:33,199
we expected like i said to support uh

1697
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:35,600
slicing for any

1698
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,120
layer of

1699
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,199
transport technologies

1700
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:43,120
uh including for example otn wdm as well

1701
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,360
as mplstp right

1702
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,239
and

1703
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:47,440
then

1704
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,320
the potentialized mdi is just

1705
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,880
built on the common model with otn

1706
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,679
specific arguments

1707
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:56,719
and

1708
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:59,920
within the design of this mbi model we

1709
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,679
try to

1710
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:06,719
reuse concepts and model fragments from

1711
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:10,400
existing drafts from both keys and

1712
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,480
from the teeth

1713
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,520
group

1714
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,000
there are a few candidates we are we

1715
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,120
have looked at

1716
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:17,920
the

network transport network slice yarn

1719
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,520
which

1720
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,320
defines a network topology

1721
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,600
for refresh based slicing

1722
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,320
and with also a list of technology

1723
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:36,000
agnostic slo attributes

1724
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,120
and

1725
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:40,480
the act and yangyang model

1726
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,239
from from tees

1727
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:43,760
which is a

1728
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:44,640
a

1729
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,080
cmi

1730
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,199
model

1731
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:49,440
that

1732
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,800
that offers the support for

1733
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:53,679
both

1734
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:56,560
type 1 and type 2 as is written in the

1735
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,760
draft

1736
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,880
which corresponds to connectivity-based

1737
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:04,480
as well as a resource-based

1738
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:08,239
virtual networks and uh the

1739
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:11,520
the only thing is uh this model is uh

1740
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,880
much uh in candle entangled with uh with

1741
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:15,920
um

1742
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,840
actin and the traffic engineering uh t

1743
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:22,719
topology um which

1744
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,440
we are trying to uh

1745
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:30,000
uh make it more uh generic and uh

1746
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,480
so this um there are some

1747
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,600
support which we uh imported from the uh

1748
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,320
from the ict and dna

1749
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,840
and the last one is actually the um the

1750
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,600
keys working group

1751
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,560
draft

1752
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,199
which was just adopted for the network

1753
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:48,960
slice mbi

1754
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,520
it has a common definition

1755
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,360
for endpoints and slos

1756
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,320
but

1757
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,159
the drawback is is only supports

1758
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,840
connectivity-based slicing

1759
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,080
and a lot of the attributes in there is

1760
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,960
iq technology specific uh which does not

1761
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,640
apply to uh transport slicing

1762
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:11,679
so

1763
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:15,440
yeah so those are the uh reference uh

1764
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,480
drafts that we are we have looked at uh

1765
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:19,280
when

1766
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,880
designing the

1767
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:21,679
the

1768
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:25,600
coming young model for otn slice npi

1769
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:29,000
next page

1770
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,360
uh yeah so this is a

1771
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,520
an overview of the

1772
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,600
entry for the

1773
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,280
common model for transport network

1774
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,560
slicing

1775
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,320
as you can see in the model we have

1776
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,040
a network slice has

1777
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,159
has

1778
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,440
slo

1779
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,400
attributes uh endpoints

1780
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,520
network

1781
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,719
network topology which could be used to

1782
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:59,040
describe a a

1783
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,520
detailed network topology on which the

1784
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,960
network slice

1785
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,960
is viewed on

1786
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:07,679
and a list of

1787
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:09,760
connectivity matrix

1788
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,239
connectivity matrices

1789
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:14,320
that

1790
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:17,440
much resembles what is

1791
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,239
in

1792
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:20,800
the the itf the in the teeth network

1793
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,600
slicing draft

1794
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,799
next page

1795
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:29,600
yeah

1796
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,960
um there is a minor update to the uh

1797
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,960
mpi-young model proposed uh before uh in

1798
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:37,760
which

1799
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:42,080
we added a a choice statement which

1800
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,760
allows a resource to be

1801
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:46,960
colored

1802
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,600
based on either the number of time slots

1803
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,280
otn time slots

1804
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,480
or

1805
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,719
a list of

1806
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,800
odu containers

1807
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,560
based on the type of the container

1808
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:04,400
next page

1809
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:09,520
okay so some open issues first thing is

1810
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:12,000
when we are designing the mbi young

1811
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,360
model

1812
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,600
as we said we're trying to reuse as much

1813
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:16,640
possible

1814
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,760
as much

1815
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,840
as possible the existing

1816
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,320
models and one of the options is to look

1817
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,960
into the schema mount

1818
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,159
and try to include uh

1819
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:32,000
model fragments from

1820
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,800
from

1821
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,120
from let's say draft a lieu

1822
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,800
network topology

1823
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,199
and put it underneath the network

1824
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:41,440
topology subtree

1825
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,800
of the

1826
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,320
of the common mdin

1827
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,280
now

1828
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:50,239
the issue we are seeing is uh what we

1829
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:53,520
are trying to do is to do a design time

1830
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,320
uh schema mount uh

1831
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,880
without redefining the

1832
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,920
the the the models

1833
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,640
however the current scheme amount only

1834
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,320
supports

1835
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:10,320
runtime and implementation time which is

1836
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,679
not necessarily what we are looking at

1837
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:14,880
and

1838
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,639
and also

1839
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:20,320
the scheme amount uh is currently

1840
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,560
missing

1841
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,920
some you know support and torchem

1842
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,040
support

1843
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:30,840
which we could use for validation

1844
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:35,120
um uh yeah so and uh whether we could

1845
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:38,159
use a schema amount uh remains an open

1846
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:40,320
issue and we need some further

1847
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,679
investigation

1848
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:45,520
uh as well as uh examples um to

1849
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:49,280
to understand how it could be used

1850
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,639
and

1851
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:54,400
another open issue is to whether

1852
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,280
to model a connectivity matrix

1853
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,679
as a topology

1854
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:02,800
basically as a single node topology or

1855
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,480
as a list of uh intended connections uh

1856
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,760
as we uh currently put in the in the um

1857
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,199
in the model

1858
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:15,840
uh i think this is a also a question to

1859
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,280
the

1860
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,920
teeth network slicing

1861
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,320
model as well

1862
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,159
this is just two different

1863
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:26,239
options and

1864
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:28,080
so we put uh

1865
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,159
we put the connectivity

1866
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:33,199
a list of connections as our um

1867
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:35,600
initial uh choice but

1868
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:38,960
it remains open as to what we go for uh

1869
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,960
next

1870
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,960
okay next page

1871
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,600
yeah so next steps

1872
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,800
we will be uh continually continuously

1873
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,679
developing otn augmentation based on the

1874
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:54,639
common

1875
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:56,960
transport natural slice model

1876
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,040
and

1877
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,480
we need to also support the slicing for

1878
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,880
non-otn links

1879
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:08,639
external links which is attached to the

1880
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:10,560
to the to the otn

1881
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,040
network

1882
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:14,960
and

1883
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,280
there are a couple of open issues uh in

1884
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,600
the github that we have

1885
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,280
we are looking at

1886
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:22,480
and also

1887
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,000
comments and reviews from the working

1888
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,920
group

1889
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,040
so

1890
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:30,320
as for the status of the draft

1891
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,800
we the authors actually believe the

1892
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,040
draft is ready for working group

1893
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,480
adoption

1894
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,440
because of the good interest we have

1895
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:40,400
seen

1896
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,600
and

1897
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,560
a good list of participants in a

1898
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,000
discussion

1899
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,120
and we have models proposed and i

1900
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,080
believe

1901
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,760
the the worker can

1902
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,120
be

1903
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,000
can

1904
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,920
be kept working on

1905
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,040
with

1906
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,920
working cooper document and we have

1907
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,159
asked for the working group adoption

1908
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:04,840
before the meeting

1909
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:07,440
so um

1910
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,159
yeah so the weekly discussion we have a

1911
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:12,960
weekly discussion uh

1912
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:17,120
set up and uh on thursday 10 to 11 am

1913
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,400
eastern time

1914
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,840
and the github is also listed here so um

1915
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,080
anyone interested in this

1916
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:28,239
work uh is more than welcome to join us

1917
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:31,280
thank you i think this is the next this

1918
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:34,920
is the last page

1919
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:39,040
any questions or comments

1920
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:44,800
okay thank you for

1921
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:48,679
any comments or questions

1922
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:05,679
no questions no comments

1923
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:07,679
it seems that all the participants are

1924
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:10,480
very nice this evening

1925
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:13,199
on this meeting right in china we are we

1926
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:17,239
are living in

1927
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:22,639
yeah i think of many interested parties

1928
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:23,679
uh

1929
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:26,080
participants already

1930
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:31,000
in our weekly discussion so

1931
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,679
the steps are clear um let's hope we

1932
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:36,159
could have uh more comments from the

1933
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:37,290
working group

1934
01:24:37,290 --> 01:24:40,399
[Music]

1935
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,760
tom yeah

1936
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,239
most of the issues are under discussion

1937
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:50,000
of the weekly call and i think we reach

1938
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,159
good consensus just one more comment

1939
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:54,800
talking about the schema amount i think

1940
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,760
the such kind of evaluation is not

1941
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,400
slicing specific and there should be a

1942
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,440
generic

1943
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,440
question to all the modules

1944
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:06,320
so i would rather

1945
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:09,120
suggest we focus on the slicing itself

1946
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:12,080
and those kind of schema amount or

1947
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,480
whatever young

1948
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,960
grammar level stuffs can be

1949
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:20,960
discussed in a more general or or work

1950
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,040
with more young experts instead of the

1951
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,120
slicing itself

1952
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,840
thank you

1953
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:30,959
okay thank you

1954
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,520
yeah yeah i'm just just to quickly

1955
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,679
respond to harmony's comments um yes i

1956
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:38,320
agree with you and i think uh

1957
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:42,080
the use of skim amount is just a tool to

1958
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:42,880
face

1959
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,120
facilitate the design of the model it

1960
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,040
shouldn't stop us from

1961
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,440
moving forward

1962
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,800
the worst case is just we have to

1963
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:56,320
copy paste some of the um definitions um

1964
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,280
but

1965
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:58,159
yeah

1966
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:00,560
that's not a

1967
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,360
shoe stopper

1968
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:08,000
actually thank you yeah i think actually

1969
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
you know the slicing topic is quite

1970
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,520
interesting and

1971
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,159
and the sexy right so and also i think

1972
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:16,960
this job is organized very well so i

1973
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:19,760
would like to power to uh to test the

1974
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,280
temperature

1975
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,920
so uh how many people think that this

1976
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,679
job is ready for

1977
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:27,440
pubg adoption

1978
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:31,199
if you support please uh type plus one

1979
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:33,360
in the chat window

1980
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:36,800
otherwise if you are object please type

1981
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,520
-1

1982
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:43,159
yeah let me see

1983
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,360
okay

1984
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,320
are you all done

1985
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:23,199
okay yeah i say many people support wg

1986
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:27,440
adoption no one object so objects

1987
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,520
so let's take on the list

1988
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,679
thank you

1989
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,800
yeah

1990
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,560
let me move to the

1991
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,560
next

1992
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:50,239
italo please

1993
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,440
and gentlemen okay i'm presenting a new

1994
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:56,800
draft

1995
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,639
for uh requesting paco potentially

1996
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:01,199
optical networks and next slide mbr for

1997
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:02,400
causes

1998
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,679
next slide please

1999
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:05,520
and contributors

2000
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:06,800
okay what is the problem that we are

2001
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,120
trying to solve we is a problem when we

2002
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,040
have an optical network which can be a w

2003
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,800
zone network a flexi grid network or

2004
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,400
even otn network

2005
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,760
and we would like to request via rpc

2006
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,600
the optical network controller to

2007
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,600
perform a part computation over the

2008
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,040
optical network

2009
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,199
there is a draft in this working group

2010
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:27,360
which describes a watcher dynamic

2011
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,280
requirements and use case

2012
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,520
for an rpc to request par computation

2013
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,760
over any type of

2014
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,440
transport engineering network a traffic

2015
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,360
engineering network and the optical

2016
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:39,920
networks are mentioned as examples of

2017
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,760
network which will benefit

2018
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:45,040
for such an rpc but and the model that

2019
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:46,639
is defined in that is working group is a

2020
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:49,520
generic and technology agnostic model

2021
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:51,760
which is uh you know developed in

2022
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:54,239
alignment with an e-tunnel model in the

2023
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:56,800
uh also developed in teaser what is

2024
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,199
missing from the working tees is just a

2025
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:01,600
set of technology specific attributes

2026
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,239
which are specific to the optical

2027
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:06,000
networks like doubles on flexibility and

2028
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,040
otn

2029
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:10,239
so what does this model is simply taking

2030
01:29:10,239 --> 01:29:12,719
the generic model developed in teas and

2031
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:15,120
you're reusing the common definition in

2032
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,520
layer zero types laser type extensionary

2033
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:18,880
one types

2034
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:22,000
and augment the generic tunnel uh the

2035
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,560
computation model with

2036
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,400
these attributes for like

2037
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,800
technology-specific labels of autonomous

2038
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,639
receiving bandwidth definitions and so

2039
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:33,840
on and uh by being

2040
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,679
based on the generic

2041
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:38,320
part compression model it's also aligned

2042
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,880
with the tunnel modes for the optical

2043
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,639
network so you can use the paco

2044
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:44,960
potential model to request the packaging

2045
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,760
and then the tunnel mode to set it up

2046
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,920
the lack of these technology specific

2047
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,679
attributes was also notified during the

2048
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:53,760
analysis in the poi

2049
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,719
stmpoi we noticed that if you want to

2050
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:59,440
request an optical controller to perform

2051
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,360
a computation in optical network you

2052
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,760
miss the information about

2053
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,679
the technology specific attributes of

2054
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:07,280
the optical network

2055
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,840
next slide

2056
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,120
so as i said the contribution the draft

2057
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,040
is very simple it's just

2058
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,760
augmenting there are but there are a few

2059
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,840
open issues maybe we is more trying to

2060
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,920
discuss one the one open issue is a

2061
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,400
little bit much bigger scope than our

2062
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,719
draft is the fact that we are using the

2063
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:28,800
razer tunnel attributes and radio path

2064
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,880
constraints groupings which are the

2065
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:33,520
finally reso type extensions but there

2066
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:36,000
are the attributes in this uh grouping

2067
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,080
needs to be validated and we already

2068
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,639
have two open issues in the tunnel in

2069
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:43,199
the github for the flexibility tunnel

2070
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:44,960
and we think that this an issue is

2071
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:47,040
equally applicable to all the drafts

2072
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,280
which are using these two groupings and

2073
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:51,679
my suggestion is to address

2074
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:53,600
this issue

2075
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,320
jointly with the other drafts and second

2076
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,960
issue is more organizational whether we

2077
01:30:58,960 --> 01:30:59,920
want

2078
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,880
to keep all district modules into one

2079
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,440
document or to split into

2080
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,360
two or three documents

2081
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:08,960
and follow the same structure as in the

2082
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,480
tunnel model so whether we want to have

2083
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,320
three documents one for ws and one for

2084
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,880
flex again and one for otn or any other

2085
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:17,840
combination

2086
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,440
we can focus the discussion on these two

2087
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,880
open issues and the next steps is

2088
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,840
basically any comment or feedbacks oh

2089
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,120
okay

2090
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,880
from the working group we we will

2091
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,080
address and please review and comment we

2092
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,600
will actually finalize what is the

2093
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,440
structure of the document so whether to

2094
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:35,520
have all to progress one document two

2095
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,600
documents or three documents

2096
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,280
and then after we have finalized the

2097
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,800
document structure i think we we should

2098
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,960
we could request working group adoption

2099
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:46,000
because we think that this is a draft

2100
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,520
that complements

2101
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,840
the current two set of working group of

2102
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,199
second working group only specific

2103
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:53,040
models which are meant the generic t

2104
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,239
models

2105
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:56,000
developed in these four optical networks

2106
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,280
and and the work is quite

2107
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,600
straightforward because we re-use

2108
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,360
definitions common definitions which are

2109
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:04,320
already available in the other drafts

2110
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,400
developed in the rsc 1983 and the other

2111
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,120
two drafts developed by c camper

2112
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:12,360
thank you

2113
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:14,719
okay thank you

2114
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:17,960
any comments

2115
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:27,760
data

2116
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,400
yeah please

2117
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,520
wait first

2118
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,760
yeah

2119
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,480
yeah i think i i think it makes sense to

2120
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,480
actually have uh

2121
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,639
cover um

2122
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:51,360
the wson and the

2123
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:54,320
flexi grid in one draft because both

2124
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,280
belong to layer 0 whereas layer 1 could

2125
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,239
be

2126
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:02,199
done in a separate draft

2127
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,560
one question do you mean one draft with

2128
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:18,040
two young modules

2129
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
yeah i mean i mean

2130
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,960
they could be organized in um yeah

2131
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,760
different two different modules

2132
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:34,760
okay

2133
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,719
okay good yeah

2134
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:44,080
okay have fun

2135
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:48,560
typing yeah i'd share the same comments

2136
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:51,360
as twitter

2137
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,840
okay thank you

2138
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:05,480
okay any more comments

2139
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,360
so i think from my perspective i think

2140
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,600
regarding one document versus three

2141
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,280
documents

2142
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,280
if there's no

2143
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,679
any fundamental difference and then i

2144
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:19,760
think we can just keep one

2145
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:22,480
uh in one document

2146
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:23,280
right

2147
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:26,480
if the document is not much big

2148
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:27,280
and

2149
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:30,400
this will be an easy way to to just

2150
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,239
document the three documentary

2151
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:36,239
models in just one single document

2152
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:43,199
is that okay for you italo

2153
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:44,800
i don't have any strong opinion on the

2154
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:47,199
number of documents

2155
01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:50,239
i'm okay with one two or three

2156
01:34:50,239 --> 01:34:52,000
okay and then maybe

2157
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,520
before working group adoption i think we

2158
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,440
need to decide how many documents we

2159
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:56,400
want to

2160
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,639
develop

2161
01:34:58,639 --> 01:34:59,600
okay

2162
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,000
but regarding the wg adoption i think

2163
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,320
maybe uh we can have one more division

2164
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,800
and then decide if uh it's ready for

2165
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,840
object option or not

2166
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,000
it's okay okay

2167
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,040
yeah okay thank you

2168
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,679
let's move to

2169
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:25,080
next one

2170
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:32,480
inventory

2171
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:35,040
okay it's harder

2172
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,040
okay thank you chair

2173
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,880
hello

2174
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:39,760
yeah

2175
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:42,480
okay nice to meet you here today okay

2176
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,480
my name is uchouda i'm from hawaii

2177
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:45,760
company

2178
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:48,719
our job is a young data model for

2179
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:51,119
optical network inventory

2180
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:54,239
i'm presenting on behalf of all authors

2181
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:56,159
and contributors

2182
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:58,560
this young model will be used in the

2183
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:02,239
northbound of network controller

2184
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:05,759
okay please go to the next page

2185
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:10,880
okay in the first page we describe the

2186
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,119
motivation of this job

2187
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:15,600
let's have a look why this model is

2188
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:16,719
needed

2189
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:18,800
the first two motivation can be

2190
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,520
described by the figure below

2191
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,920
okay let's see the operation and

2192
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,560
management system of operators is

2193
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:29,760
consists of various oss

2194
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:33,040
the resource management oss which is in

2195
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,760
red and in the middle of this figure

2196
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,480
is playing a very important role

2197
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:41,040
it collect inventory data from network

2198
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,840
control and provide

2199
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,719
resource validation resource mapping and

2200
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:48,880
resource retrieval functionality for the

2201
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:49,679
other

2202
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:51,679
oss

2203
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:54,080
but the inventory data stored in the

2204
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:57,040
resource management oss system is

2205
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,600
usually collected by some private

2206
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:00,719
protocols

2207
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:02,239
like cobar

2208
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:04,560
xml and restful

2209
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,600
and for rascal interface we just find

2210
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:08,639
one

2211
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:13,280
uh hardware data model in rfc 8348

2212
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,920
which is considered to be used in

2213
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:18,560
used to do hardware management on the

2214
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,480
single network element

2215
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,719
and it cannot provide a network level

2216
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:24,560
management interface

2217
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,320
so we consider that

2218
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,239
there is a need for

2219
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:31,840
network in one tree young model

2220
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,440
so far

2221
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,760
we have designed this model based on the

2222
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:38,080
inventory of optical network

2223
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:40,480
and this model are probably also

2224
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:43,679
applicable to other technology like ip

2225
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:46,239
and microwave

2226
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:50,000
it can be technology agnostics

2227
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,520
okay please go to the next page

2228
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,480
we investigate

2229
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:01,199
on the existing data model in itf and

2230
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:03,600
clarify the model relationship in this

2231
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,520
page

2232
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:09,480
according to fc8345

2233
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:12,960
the inventory data model should be

2234
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,840
could be augmentation of

2235
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:18,159
abstract network model

2236
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:20,480
by considering the complexity of the

2237
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:21,920
existing top

2238
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:23,760
topology model

2239
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:26,000
and some applications only want to

2240
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,840
retrieve in one tree

2241
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,760
so

2242
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,679
if if uh

2243
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:34,159
we augment the the inventory model

2244
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:35,760
element the

2245
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:38,239
network model some more filtering step

2246
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:41,520
will be required and some unnecessary

2247
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:45,119
misunderstanding will remain so

2248
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:47,760
and also the integration difficulty will

2249
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:51,440
get worse in the large scale or network

2250
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:53,520
so we propose to have an independent

2251
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:56,000
route for the inventory model just like

2252
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,520
the figure in option 2 shows

2253
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,040
with a new route

2254
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:04,000
the retrieval of inventory data can be

2255
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,320
acquired in a single step

2256
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:09,600
and without filtering

2257
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,800
okay please go to the next page

2258
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:15,840
and for

2259
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,480
rfc 8340a

2260
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:19,360
so

2261
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:21,119
it is a network

2262
01:39:21,119 --> 01:39:23,600
element level but we think its generic

2263
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:27,280
modeling idea will be good for our model

2264
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:30,320
being abducted by other technology

2265
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:33,360
in this hardware model of the objects in

2266
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:34,719
network element

2267
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:37,840
can be defined as a component

2268
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:40,159
and they they can be distinguished by

2269
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:41,920
their classes

2270
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,080
if our inventor model will use this

2271
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:45,840
component idea

2272
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,760
and also some

2273
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:50,480
common attributes it will help adoption

2274
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:54,320
and in other technology

2275
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,960
but for inventory model

2276
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:59,520
we only focus on the state data all the

2277
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:02,480
configuration data in rfc834a

2278
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:05,840
will now be taken into consideration

2279
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,199
besides

2280
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:10,320
with uh with the steel among technology

2281
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:14,519
defined in fc 8528

2282
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:16,560
there could be the possibility that the

2283
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:20,560
hardware model data can be added to some

2284
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,560
other young models

2285
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:25,199
if a wonder has implemented the hardware

2286
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:26,239
model

2287
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:28,159
we can he can

2288
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:31,920
add the hardware model data to the

2289
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,000
network model to provide inventory

2290
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,119
information instead but

2291
01:40:37,119 --> 01:40:39,760
skip among is still under investigation

2292
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:40,960
because not

2293
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:42,960
too much example has been found right

2294
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,400
now

2295
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:48,679
okay please go to the next page

2296
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:53,520
in this page we provide all the

2297
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,280
inventory object

2298
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,440
and their relationship

2299
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:59,360
just like the figure shows

2300
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:02,080
the inventory objects contain

2301
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,520
equipment room

2302
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:04,400
rack

2303
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:05,840
network element

2304
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:08,960
shelf slow or substrate board

2305
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:10,800
and post

2306
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,639
in real network

2307
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:16,560
a rack can be deployed with several

2308
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,960
narrow element and uh

2309
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:19,840
and a

2310
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,560
network element can also be installed on

2311
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,159
different racks

2312
01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:27,280
so they are no parent to child

2313
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:29,280
relationship

2314
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:31,119
the same situation is also happening

2315
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:34,000
between slot and both

2316
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,400
these are the special scenario we need

2317
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,000
to consider

2318
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,280
when we specify the inventory model

2319
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:45,960
okay please go to the next page

2320
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:49,360
okay

2321
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,760
here is the young model we provide in

2322
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:52,960
this draft

2323
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:56,159
it follow the uh the the young model for

2324
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:58,159
the relationship we draw in the last

2325
01:41:58,159 --> 01:41:59,199
page

2326
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:01,600
and we just defined a

2327
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:04,080
simple inventory model with a lot of

2328
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:05,760
detailed information

2329
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:08,480
this information will be specified in

2330
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:11,520
future step by step

2331
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,840
and you can also see that

2332
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:17,239
we have reduced the component idea as

2333
01:42:17,239 --> 01:42:19,119
fc8348

2334
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:21,679
a component list is defined under the

2335
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:24,080
network animal node

2336
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:25,199
and

2337
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:26,880
to support the

2338
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,560
one network element installed on

2339
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:31,600
different racks narrow the rack is not

2340
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:34,560
defined as a component

2341
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:36,560
of network element

2342
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:39,840
but the shaft in rock can refer to shelf

2343
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:40,880
component

2344
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:44,080
in network element

2345
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:48,320
okay please go to the next page

2346
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:54,400
in current work we focus on optical

2347
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:57,280
inventory model and receive good support

2348
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,760
from c-cam experts

2349
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:02,560
since the model may also be applicable

2350
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:05,440
to a wider scope

2351
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,520
we will report our progress to other

2352
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:11,040
working group continually such as a

2353
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:12,880
network and

2354
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:16,080
ops awg

2355
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:19,520
and we think that there is also a lot of

2356
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:22,239
room for discussion that whether the

2357
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:25,199
inventory model arguments

2358
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:29,679
fc 83 40 45 or not

2359
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:32,800
so as the scheme among technology

2360
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:34,960
do we need to take into consideration

2361
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:37,280
when it is not

2362
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:41,600
widely supported in young ecosystems

2363
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:44,560
okay that's all for my presentation uh

2364
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:45,520
when

2365
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,280
we also create a

2366
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:50,480
repository in github and we are looking

2367
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:52,960
forward to your comments feedback and we

2368
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:58,239
are also open to collaboration thank you

2369
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:01,600
okay thank you uh todd

2370
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:04,920
any questions

2371
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:11,920
questions are welcome

2372
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:14,960
any questions

2373
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:21,840
no questions

2374
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:25,280
so i would like to ask okay you tell

2375
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:27,440
them

2376
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,880
it's another question about whether uh

2377
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:34,080
okay the draft s we plan to uh engineer

2378
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:36,480
to make the rough more generic and

2379
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:39,760
it's good to to to clarify that uh this

2380
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:41,920
is the working group where we

2381
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:43,440
we continue

2382
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,920
or or not

2383
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:49,920
uh we suggest to continue this job in

2384
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:53,199
yeah yeah okay okay uh we we suggest to

2385
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:56,719
continue to uh this job in the in in our

2386
01:44:56,719 --> 01:44:59,199
c camp group okay and for the other

2387
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:01,119
group we will okay

2388
01:45:01,119 --> 01:45:03,119
uh report our progress to them and

2389
01:45:03,119 --> 01:45:06,080
whether it will be abducted by their the

2390
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,800
other uh working group uh

2391
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:12,000
it's up to them okay

2392
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:13,600
yeah

2393
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:16,000
so actually i think we we could get some

2394
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,880
advice from our ad john

2395
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:22,159
yeah please john

2396
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:29,040
wondering about the same thing um i mean

2397
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:29,920
it

2398
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:32,400
seems like for the moment continuing it

2399
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,560
here and discussing the other working

2400
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:37,199
groups is probably the right thing to do

2401
01:45:37,199 --> 01:45:39,600
hopefully we can have

2402
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,199
something a little firmer before that we

2403
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:43,360
come around to the next ietf

2404
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:45,360
presumably in

2405
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:46,960
discussion with the chairs of those

2406
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:49,600
other groups

2407
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:52,320
okay thank you very much i don't have a

2408
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:55,280
problem with proceeding here

2409
01:45:56,320 --> 01:46:00,400
okay thank you yeah good

2410
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:04,320
and add comments

2411
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:14,639
and we got uh okay so yeah

2412
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:18,159
um here just a quicker comment uh i

2413
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:21,199
think like i agree we could uh continue

2414
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:24,000
this work in the c camp working group

2415
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,080
but the name of the draft uh contains uh

2416
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:31,040
optical i think which is a bit uh too

2417
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,600
constraining uh maybe we could

2418
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:36,639
make it more like a network inventory so

2419
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:39,520
in the in the future if we if we

2420
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:42,000
make it more generic and have

2421
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,560
have it in other words groups

2422
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,560
that could be

2423
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:47,920
could be

2424
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:49,440
could be done easily

2425
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,920
otherwise if we make it like optical we

2426
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:53,520
are constraining

2427
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:58,080
only to the optical uh inventory

2428
01:46:58,159 --> 01:46:59,119
yeah

2429
01:46:59,119 --> 01:47:01,440
okay

2430
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:04,560
okay thank you guys

2431
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:07,199
yeah and also uh duncan said kevin you

2432
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:09,760
know i sent a question to the list thank

2433
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:12,239
you that

2434
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:16,879
let's move to uh next

2435
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:21,119
cloud to

2436
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:24,400
optic to cloud

2437
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:27,119
okay awesome

2438
01:47:27,119 --> 01:47:30,560
i shouldn't yeah can you hear me

2439
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,000
yeah

2440
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:32,880
thank you

2441
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,119
and thank you hello everyone

2442
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:37,360
this draft is from china mobile and

2443
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,920
huawei technology i'm showing you from

2444
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,320
china mobile and i will give a

2445
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:44,480
presentation on advertising cloud via

2446
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:47,280
optical network problem statement

2447
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:50,719
next page please

2448
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:53,600
so the first slide thought about the

2449
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:55,679
motivation of this world

2450
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:59,679
as uh cloud bases as cloud-based

2451
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:02,719
applications are going in popularity

2452
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:04,639
data center and the data center

2453
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:06,800
international connection

2454
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:07,600
are

2455
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:10,800
becoming increasingly important

2456
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,000
for example

2457
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,880
finance servers need a low latency high

2458
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:17,280
reliability connection government

2459
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,760
service need a lot of bandwidth under

2460
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:23,440
high security international medicine may

2461
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:25,280
need a lot of bandwidth and high

2462
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:28,080
reliability and the internet company may

2463
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:31,280
need live bandwidth and low latency

2464
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:33,520
so firstly

2465
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:36,639
user users access

2466
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:39,119
clause mainly with

2467
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:42,159
ip networks

2468
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:43,199
but

2469
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:45,600
currently we believe exercising clause

2470
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:48,239
with optical networks is increasingly

2471
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:50,000
attractive and

2472
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,320
becoming a

2473
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:55,440
option for the users

2474
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:56,560
since

2475
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:00,320
option networks is based on tdm time

2476
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:03,600
division multiplexing technologies so

2477
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:07,280
it doesn't have a true issues and can

2478
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:10,960
perfect avoid avoid

2479
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:12,320
patches

2480
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,960
congestion under something like that

2481
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:18,560
so we think is just the rhythm within is

2482
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:21,520
suitable for exercising

2483
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:22,480
clause

2484
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:26,280
let's slice please

2485
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:32,159
so i will give several use cases um for

2486
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:33,920
optical

2487
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:36,719
network exercising clause the first use

2488
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:39,280
case is the multi-cloud as

2489
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:41,040
of sizing

2490
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:44,560
so basically closer services are usually

2491
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:48,159
supported by multiple interconnected

2492
01:49:48,159 --> 01:49:49,599
data center

2493
01:49:49,599 --> 01:49:52,080
which are uh

2494
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:54,800
which are spaced

2495
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:55,840
with

2496
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:58,639
within one region

2497
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:00,320
normally within

2498
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:01,679
one kilo

2499
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:03,280
meter

2500
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:05,199
the reason uh

2501
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:09,119
to spacing within within one kilometer

2502
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:10,639
is that

2503
01:50:10,639 --> 01:50:12,480
it's like that

2504
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:13,280
the

2505
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:16,239
cloud service you really need to support

2506
01:50:16,239 --> 01:50:20,320
it to active storage or

2507
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:23,360
virtual machine services and some

2508
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:26,480
services of this kind so the distance

2509
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:28,000
should be

2510
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,320
not too far

2511
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:31,679
so the

2512
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:34,639
closer is have the demand of

2513
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:37,119
for example on demand services

2514
01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:39,840
scalability high availability and

2515
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:41,599
user-based

2516
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:43,040
building

2517
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:46,239
outside raw and this raised the

2518
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:48,239
requirement for data center

2519
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:50,880
interconnection

2520
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:54,400
like capacity large capacity low latency

2521
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:57,119
reliability and the flexible scaling

2522
01:50:57,119 --> 01:51:00,639
scheduling etc

2523
01:51:00,639 --> 01:51:03,360
we believe uh advanced

2524
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:07,199
optical transport network is ideal for

2525
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:08,880
this

2526
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:12,400
decentral interconnection applications

2527
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,880
for example we can use

2528
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:17,520
vpn to connect the

2529
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:21,440
multiple cloud and we use

2530
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:23,440
odu

2531
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:27,440
audiok as the tunnel tunnels

2532
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:30,080
in between to connect this cloud

2533
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:33,840
perhaps we also can use smart management

2534
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:35,760
and control system

2535
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:36,560
to

2536
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:40,960
for the traffic percept perception

2537
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:44,800
and so on next page please

2538
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:49,440
the second use case is a higher quality

2539
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:51,280
least light

2540
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:54,560
a high quality private land provide

2541
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:57,520
high large bandwidth low latency high

2542
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:00,639
security and reliability

2543
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:03,280
with optimized words actually we can

2544
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:04,800
have all this

2545
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:08,080
this kind of attributes

2546
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:10,560
users can move their core asset to

2547
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:12,000
clause side

2548
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,320
and uh

2549
01:52:14,719 --> 01:52:16,800
unless operator try

2550
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:20,639
with this optical network to assess

2551
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:21,920
clause

2552
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:22,719
uh

2553
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:25,599
operator can accept accelerate the

2554
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:28,560
deployment of the cloud services and

2555
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:32,080
reduce capacity overpass

2556
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:35,280
next slide please

2557
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:39,040
and the third use case is a claude

2558
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:41,599
virtual variety

2559
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:43,440
as we know

2560
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:44,400
that

2561
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:48,400
user experience of the virtual reality

2562
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:50,559
is

2563
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:54,400
mainly depends on

2564
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:57,280
the local dedicated hardware for

2565
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:00,080
rendering if we move the rendering

2566
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:02,719
resources from local to

2567
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:06,320
cloud size it can improve the user

2568
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:09,199
experience by having more

2569
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:10,840
rendering

2570
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:13,760
resources but this is a higher

2571
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:16,719
requirement for the interconnect

2572
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:19,040
interconnection network between users

2573
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:20,719
and clause

2574
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:22,320
for example

2575
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:25,840
we need a hair available and granted and

2576
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:28,960
sometimes flexible bandwidth for example

2577
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:31,679
larger than one gigabit per second

2578
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:34,159
and sometimes and a lower latency for

2579
01:53:34,159 --> 01:53:35,119
example

2580
01:53:35,119 --> 01:53:35,840
uh

2581
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:38,960
smaller than 10 milliseconds and the

2582
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:40,880
lower jitter

2583
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:42,159
for example

2584
01:53:42,159 --> 01:53:45,920
smaller than five minutes second

2585
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:48,159
so actually

2586
01:53:48,159 --> 01:53:50,159
optical

2587
01:53:50,159 --> 01:53:52,400
network is very promising for this

2588
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,320
requirement

2589
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:57,679
next slide please

2590
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:01,599
this slide summarize the

2591
01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:04,400
requirements for optimal network to

2592
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:07,360
assess clause

2593
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:12,159
optical networks with vpn can be used to

2594
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:13,119
uh

2595
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:16,560
to to access multiple tools

2596
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:19,520
it can be used for multiple to multiple

2597
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,280
cloud assessing

2598
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:23,920
thus actually currently some old tn

2599
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:26,080
equipment has already adopted the

2600
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:28,800
package processing functions such as

2601
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:31,679
package switching nprs

2602
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:33,440
vpn etc

2603
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:35,280
optical networks also have a high

2604
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:38,480
performance and high reliability

2605
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:43,679
also small smaller granularity container

2606
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:47,520
some for example flexible

2607
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:52,480
for example with the flexibility of from

2608
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:53,679
two

2609
01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:54,639
mega

2610
01:54:54,639 --> 01:54:57,440
bits to one gigabit per second is

2611
01:54:57,440 --> 01:54:59,520
required to improve the efficiency of

2612
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:00,639
the network

2613
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:02,480
and lastly high

2614
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:04,560
bandwidth and the low latency and the

2615
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:06,960
low data are required for specific

2616
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:10,639
application that cloud vr

2617
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:13,520
nest slides please

2618
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:14,639
so

2619
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:15,520
and

2620
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:18,080
this is the last slide and talk about

2621
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:20,239
the status and plan

2622
01:55:20,239 --> 01:55:21,280
actually

2623
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:24,400
in the other group rtgwg

2624
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:26,080
has already

2625
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:27,760
have two

2626
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:30,960
useful related words uh network to plot

2627
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:33,360
gap analysis and the network to cloud

2628
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:35,760
proven statement

2629
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:40,000
we i just presented

2630
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:44,800
this slide yesterday at the rt gwg and

2631
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:46,400
that sounds feedback

2632
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:48,480
and i think this

2633
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:51,000
the content of this draft is

2634
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,400
complementary to the above

2635
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:56,159
work

2636
01:55:56,159 --> 01:55:58,800
yesterday i received the feedback that

2637
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:00,719
actually this work is a

2638
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:04,400
very optimal specific so

2639
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:05,679
i

2640
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:07,599
i'm here to call for interest and the

2641
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:10,000
joint compute can be

2642
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,080
computed compute

2643
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:15,360
contribution from us europe

2644
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:16,320
thank you

2645
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:18,320
i will stop here for

2646
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:21,199
comment a question

2647
01:56:21,199 --> 01:56:24,080
okay thank you yeah son so i don't think

2648
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:25,920
we have enough time for the detailed

2649
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:28,480
discussion this year after you know what

2650
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:30,560
presented in the launching

2651
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:33,360
earlier working group yesterday so how

2652
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:34,960
many could you quickly share the

2653
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:38,760
discussion to us

2654
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:45,599
for some common objectives with given to

2655
01:56:45,599 --> 01:56:48,719
rpgw document but according to their

2656
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:51,679
feedback it looks like

2657
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:54,560
we are having separated the requirements

2658
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:56,800
we have separated the solution of course

2659
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:57,840
the

2660
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:59,520
solution would be optical based so it

2661
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,480
belongs to camp and

2662
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:03,760
this is

2663
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:06,000
just the kickoff of the the new

2664
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,880
application work and is still at the

2665
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:12,080
starting stage and

2666
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:14,960
i will talk with xiang and

2667
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:18,000
decide what to do in next step probably

2668
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,800
with evaluation on the gap analysis on

2669
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:23,199
what is the missing point for the

2670
01:57:23,199 --> 01:57:26,320
current product stack and we will report

2671
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:29,759
in next meeting

2672
01:57:30,719 --> 01:57:33,119
but we plan to switch to the

2673
01:57:33,119 --> 01:57:36,159
working group thank you

2674
01:57:36,159 --> 01:57:38,960
okay if anyone has you know more

2675
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:40,639
comments or questions please check to

2676
01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:43,360
the list okay let's move to the uh

2677
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:46,360
next

2678
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:02,480
okay

2679
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:05,760
this is a draft about a semi-active wdm

2680
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:08,960
mbi and it's from china mobile and

2681
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:09,920
huawei

2682
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:12,800
next page please

2683
01:58:14,159 --> 01:58:16,239
next page please

2684
01:58:16,239 --> 01:58:17,840
can you hear me please

2685
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:18,880
okay

2686
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:21,920
firstly i will introduce the semi-active

2687
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:25,119
wpm quickly

2688
01:58:25,119 --> 01:58:27,440
the semi-active wdm

2689
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:28,159
is

2690
01:58:28,159 --> 01:58:29,440
composed by

2691
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:32,239
passive part and active part

2692
01:58:32,239 --> 01:58:34,080
by the aeo side

2693
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:36,880
there are there are colored optical

2694
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:41,360
models and also max and demax models

2695
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:44,960
by the deal side there is active wtm

2696
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:48,400
equipment so we need you we need to use

2697
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:51,520
a centralized management system to

2698
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:53,920
control the wdm

2699
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:57,679
equipment and the remote optical modules

2700
01:58:57,679 --> 01:59:01,199
so the the management system can connect

2701
01:59:01,199 --> 01:59:03,199
with the wtm

2702
01:59:03,199 --> 01:59:07,040
equipment but the remote optical modules

2703
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:10,159
cannot be connected directly

2704
01:59:10,159 --> 01:59:13,119
so we use an rear arm channel to

2705
01:59:13,119 --> 01:59:14,400
transmit

2706
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:16,480
the management and the control

2707
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,880
information between the

2708
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:22,159
remote optical modules and the wdm

2709
01:59:22,159 --> 01:59:24,159
equipment

2710
01:59:24,159 --> 01:59:28,639
and the oem channel can be realized by

2711
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:33,119
by service signal overhead or by the

2712
01:59:33,119 --> 01:59:36,239
pilot tune with the load

2713
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:39,679
modulation depth of the optical channel

2714
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:40,880
signal

2715
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:44,360
netflix please

2716
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:47,199
next page please

2717
01:59:47,199 --> 01:59:48,880
so uh

2718
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:51,679
yeah the semi-active wdm

2719
01:59:51,679 --> 01:59:54,560
can not only greatly reduce the

2720
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:55,760
pressure of

2721
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:59,119
optical fibers resources but also has

2722
01:59:59,119 --> 02:00:01,119
the advantages

2723
02:00:01,119 --> 02:00:05,440
in cost management and protection

2724
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:08,239
the first one is some active

2725
02:00:08,239 --> 02:00:11,360
system can support optical air

2726
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:12,719
protection

2727
02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:15,920
the second one is semi-active wdm can

2728
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:18,800
support a fault and

2729
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:20,400
performance

2730
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:21,679
monitoring

2731
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:24,639
the last one is the remote optical

2732
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:27,760
modules can be also management managed

2733
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:28,800
by the

2734
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:30,880
transport controller

2735
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:34,239
and we have we have approached the

2736
02:00:34,239 --> 02:00:37,199
data plan schemes of of the same active

2737
02:00:37,199 --> 02:00:39,360
wdm in iu

2738
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:40,560
and some

2739
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:44,080
some projects have been established so

2740
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:47,920
we suggest to start the research about

2741
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:51,040
the management and the ndi for

2742
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:57,040
some active wdm in itf next page please

2743
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,040
so we think about what should be managed

2744
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:01,760
for

2745
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:04,320
some active wdm

2746
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:06,000
by the local side

2747
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,760
we should manage the wtm equipment

2748
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:12,159
and the the card

2749
02:01:12,159 --> 02:01:15,840
the port and so on and in the

2750
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:19,199
remote side we also need to

2751
02:01:19,199 --> 02:01:22,560
manage the optical modules and about the

2752
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:24,000
whole system

2753
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:24,800
we

2754
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:26,000
manage the

2755
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,159
topology and the

2756
02:01:28,159 --> 02:01:30,799
connections

2757
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:35,880
so and next page please

2758
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:38,880
i will introduce quickly

2759
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:39,679
uh

2760
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:42,880
it is it is preferred uh the some active

2761
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:46,639
wdm system should be managed by the

2762
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:49,679
transport controller uh tool including

2763
02:01:49,679 --> 02:01:53,280
the local wdm equipment and the remote

2764
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:55,280
optical modules

2765
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:58,080
and there are some existing modules

2766
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:00,960
models in itf

2767
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:03,119
we have listed here

2768
02:02:03,119 --> 02:02:07,280
some of them are defined for wdm system

2769
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:11,199
so we think maybe they can use for

2770
02:02:11,199 --> 02:02:15,119
same active wdm maybe not so we think

2771
02:02:15,119 --> 02:02:17,280
the extension for

2772
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:19,760
semi-active wtm is

2773
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:22,639
still an undergoing research

2774
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:26,320
the next page please

2775
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:29,440
so next step

2776
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:32,400
firstly we will

2777
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:34,800
evaluation you might evaluate the

2778
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,639
existing models

2779
02:02:36,639 --> 02:02:38,800
and we should think about

2780
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:41,520
what need to be extended for

2781
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:43,440
semi-active wdm

2782
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:46,639
and maybe we will give a detailed

2783
02:02:46,639 --> 02:02:49,599
description or a

2784
02:02:49,599 --> 02:02:53,040
conclusion sometime later maybe a next

2785
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:54,480
meeting

2786
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:58,000
so at last we are glad to invite more

2787
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,599
people to enjoy to try this work

2788
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:04,000
that's all

2789
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:07,760
okay thank you you already spent

2790
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:10,239
three more minutes yeah

2791
02:03:10,239 --> 02:03:12,960
so actually i see a comment from deborah

2792
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:17,119
and he sent a comment in the chat window

2793
02:03:17,119 --> 02:03:18,320
he says

2794
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:20,400
she says we should do you know separate

2795
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:23,040
date plan from kanji plan yeah i fully

2796
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:26,719
agree with her comment so anyway yeah

2797
02:03:26,719 --> 02:03:29,199
so actually in the cam we cannot define

2798
02:03:29,199 --> 02:03:31,520
you know our date data plan technologies

2799
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:33,520
we just defined the county plan stuff

2800
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:36,400
and so uh we have to monitor the

2801
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:40,560
progress of the data planning iqt15

2802
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:42,400
yeah

2803
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:45,599
any comments

2804
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:48,000
so i actually we don't have time for

2805
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,800
