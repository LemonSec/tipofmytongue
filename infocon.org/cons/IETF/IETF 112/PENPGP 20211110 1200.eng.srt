um but the ether pad is it works pretty

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,239
well i think

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,480

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,799
yeah sorry lots of eyes on java

26
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,560
and i'll be keeping an eye on java with

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,439
me as two different kinds of login

28
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,040

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,119
get fixed over time

36
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,000

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,600
jonathan um

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,000
this is the links to the various bits

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,600
and pieces about the

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,200
um

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,280
working groups and this the mailing list

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,200
and the charter etc and the etherpad

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,439
notes and so on the media materials the

45
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,720
slides are all uploaded so for those

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,719
people presenting

47
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,880
you can probably find it most easy to

48
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,840
use the

49
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,600
share

50
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,360
pre-uploaded slides button and we can

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,119
direct you towards that if need be when

52
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,280
we get there

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,959
um so

54
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,720
this is the note well so if you've been

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,080
in other itf sessions you may have seen

56
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,640
this there's a whole bunch of things

57
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,160
a good itf participant will pay

58
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,680
attention to uh including ipr rules and

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,120
you know being being reasonable with one

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,879
another and being uh behaving well um so

61
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,160
there's a whole bunch of texts around

62
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,920
that that you probably should make

63
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,440
yourself familiar with if you're

64
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,920
involved in the itf study degree

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,959
but again you should have seen this at

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,440
the start of many sessions

67
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,800
and my last slide is our agenda

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,319

69
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,000

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,120
and

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,000

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,840

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,879
changes

75
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,720
in the crypto refresh draft which is our

76
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,319
main

77
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,760
piece of charter our sole piece of

78
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,120
charter work really

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,239
um

80
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,000
then daniel will talk about some more

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,640
choices that we have to make still um

82
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,760
and what's to be have to be done daniel

83
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,720
another daniel daniels pkg we'll cover

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,879
uh another best

85
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,239
and then justice we'll talk about in

86
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,319
drop test suites uh just to describe

87
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,680
what's happened recently i guess for

88
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,360
those who maybe you're not following the

89
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,760
readiness that well or that closely

90
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,159
we we have a design team which consists

91
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,400
of the chairs and a bunch of

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,239
open pgp or people who implement open

93
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,000
pgp and we have about three or four

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,400
different implementations represented

95
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
uh plus the editors of the documents

96
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,519
that's paul mainly as a non-implementer

97
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,959
and actually we've been meeting weekly

98
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,360
in the last couple of months uh

99
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,959
making pretty good progress and working

100
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,239
kind of very productively together i

101
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,280
think uh everybody's been quite open and

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,560
collaborative

103
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,959
and now that's resulted in a draft that

104
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,799
we just admitted a couple weeks before

105
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,000
this session

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,040
the design team is an ietf design team

107
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,319
which kind of means it's a closed group

108
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,920
but the mailing list for the design team

109
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,760
the archive is open

110
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,239
um so everybody can read the messages to

111
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,760
that design to your archive which mostly

112
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,599
consists of meeting notes every week

113
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,959
um

114
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,640
and again i'd like to thank the the

115
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,760
people who've been involved in that

116
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,439
because it's it's been very productive

117
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,920
uh people have you know set aside

118
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,160
uh past arguments in some cases and

119
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,478
worked ahead which is great

120
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,800
uh so i'm just gonna leave a minute then

121
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,639

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,880
that work continued for a while and then

172
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,400
after a while there were too many things

173
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,080
happening but that also caused that

174
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,000
nothing was happening anymore and it

175
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,560
sort of stalled so

176
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,919
what happened to us

177
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,639
next slide

178
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,840
is that

179
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,000
the working group got restarted so uh

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
one of the things was that that stephen

181
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,639
farrell was added

182
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,880
as a working group chair and i was added

183
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,120
as a document author

184
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,240
uh in an editor role to try and and sort

185
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,800
of add more neutrality to the discussion

186
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,520
and sort of uh try to to

187
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,039
stick to the ietf process and move along

188
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,199
and to to make this start more clean is

189
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,199
what we did was um

190
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,319
we took the items off that was already

191
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,160
in the base document but started from

192
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,120
rfc 4880 from scratch and

193
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,680
so we we then started adding chunks of

194
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,759
you know what we thought was agreed upon

195
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,199
work by the working group and started

196
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,280
adding that into the crypto refresh

197
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,560
document

198
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,599
and that stepped onward for a bit um

199
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,440
it started making some progress but then

200
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,120
it also sort of

201
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,400
slowly um became bogged down

202
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,039
in discussion because it's very um

203
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,879
it's very easy to to end up in in

204
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,800
endless discussions when there's lots of

205
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,720
people and lots of opinions and lots of

206
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,800
good good discussion happening

207
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,240
but we needed more of a basis to

208
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,680
continue so

209
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,080
next slide

210
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,759
to to avoid making the same mistake

211
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,520
again what we did was the additives

212
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,080
design team uh that stephen already

213
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,800
mentioned and this allowed us to get a

214
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,680
few more uh focused discussion going a

215
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,479
few more items uh ticked off and

216
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,479
more items from the best document merged

217
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,280
into the crypto refresh

218
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,599
it stuck to weekly meetings and so

219
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,319
there's a bit of a good good push to get

220
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,560
things done and to

221
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,879
to have more regular face-to-face time

222
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,839
get good decisions made that

223
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,760
especially all the implementers agreed

224
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,599
on and since the design team is mostly

225
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,200
implementers and a few people steering

226
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,880
the process

227
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,240
that gave us actually a much better

228
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,040
basis to to continue to work and then to

229
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,880
pull everything in

230
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,720
so that's sort of where we are we've

231
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,120
we've pulled in most of the old this

232
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
document we added some new things along

233
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,839
the way as well

234
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,320
and i think the work is is progressing

235
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,680
nicely

236
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,560
so next slide

237
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,279
but just to to

238
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,480
to reiterate the design team uh workflow

239
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,000
and everything that's being done is

240
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,920
completely open and transparent you can

241
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,800
see all of these links that tells uh it

242
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,040
tells you what what we're doing

243
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,720
we're using git and we're trying to make

244
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,440
a

245
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,480
good

246
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,240
good git commits that are readable per

247
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,279
issue

248
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,040
that make the discussion a little easier

249
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,480
to follow we're using a tracker um

250
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,839
with with merge requests or prs

251
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,080
we're using topic ranges to

252
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,800
to get these these chunks of new text

253
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,240
into the document

254
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,399
um we're having discussions on on the on

255
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,320
the tracker there and everybody is

256
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,600
welcome to to um to join that process um

257
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,800
it might just be that um you know we

258
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,120
we upvote or downvote some of that work

259
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,279
in a design team to either be postponed

260
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,880
for later or

261
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,040
we might we might say that that's for

262
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
now out of scope or

263
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,880
not for the crypto refresh document but

264
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,640
for more suited for another document um

265
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,959
or will will will obviously take take

266
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,640
the obvious fixes that people are

267
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,120
proposing in so do not feel excluded as

268
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,640
a working group um

269
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,040
everybody's still there um the output of

270
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,959
this work will also be the input to the

271
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,959
working group we're just trying to make

272
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,480
sure that we're not getting stuck again

273
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,680
with uh

274
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,399
with

275
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,360
you know there's a sort of four month

276
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,680
cadence of lots of people be having a

277
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,920
lot of interest and then sort of

278
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,600
losing interest for the until the next

279
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
ietf meeting comes and meanwhile a lot

280
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,560
of

281
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,360
issues are stuck

282
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,040
so with that said next slide

283
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,720
where are we um most of the 4880 bits

284
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,000
has been merged into the crypto

285
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,800
refresher i think we're not actually um

286
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,640
technically further than we were except

287
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,839
that there are still some things we need

288
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,839
to just pull in some some last minute

289
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,120
things um

290
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,279
if you're curious most of that work was

291
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,600
tracked in a step-by-step range and it

292
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,000
was created to sort of

293
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,160
logically pull the data out of the old

294
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,959
this document into into the new crypto

295
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,600
refresh work

296
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,440
um

297
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,480
some work we we sort of postponed on

298
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,240
purpose such as the mandatory to

299
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,920
implement because we were both waiting

300
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,040
to see what happens

301
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,399
generally in ietf with

302
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,560
things like post quantum to where we add

303
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,680
to nist recommendations to other input

304
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,279
but that's also something that is that

305
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,360
is fairly easy to change and we expected

306
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,600
that discussion will happen anyway

307
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,160
so that is something that that we expect

308
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,519
to

309
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,920
to have a more full open php working

310
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,560
group discussion about um

311
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,399
but at least some sort of the menial

312
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,240
task the little clarifications and

313
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,800
updates and rewrites and making fancier

314
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,480
tables to make it more readable all of

315
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,240
those things we can we can now more

316
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,160
quickly go through those have been done

317
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,240
and we're continuing to move this

318
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,000
process um so a few more details uh next

319
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,360
slide

320
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,240
um you can see that

321
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,399
daniel had sent out an email earlier

322
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,880
with some of this data in it already

323
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,200
so um the notable work done between the

324
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,279
last two versions of the crypto refresh

325
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,160
is that the ad packet got defined and

326
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,120
slightly updated and it was actually a

327
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,360
little more work than i expected

328
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,079
um 88 protection of secret key material

329
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,760
um internet recipient subpacket

330
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,720
uh sks v5 for aed um the archon 2 got

331
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,560
added um

332
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,120
the curves to the fact 1948 got added

333
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,519
and there was some slight uh

334
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,959
fairly long discussion actually about

335
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,040
how the exact format should be encoded

336
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,200
and what the best ways were

337
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,959
especially because some implementations

338
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,399
implemented

339
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,079
something slightly different or

340
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,160
different from what we would like to see

341
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,000
now we had good discussions with all the

342
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
implementers and and managed to move

343
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,360
that forward that was actually really

344
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,800
great

345
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,959
um

346
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,320
some other things drop questionable

347
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,760
advice about dropping keys um but again

348
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
uh the previous link the previous slides

349
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,120
showed the links where you can see all

350
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,920
the commits and and merge pr's to get a

351
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,680
full detailed look on what we've done

352
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,160
so next slide

353
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,800
some notable work not done um like i

354
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,560
said mandatory to implement um there's

355
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,079
going to be a presentation after this

356
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,160
about this

357
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,920
v5 signatures

358
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,399
we have an a fairly active discussion on

359
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,880
what to do there in issue 45 if you're

360
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,079
interested

361
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,199
uh fife keys is also an ongoing issue um

362
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,880
i think we're almost there but there's

363
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,959
still um

364
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,040
some some some things in the pipeline

365
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,360
before we're fully done so you can see

366
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,839
that on the on the merch request

367
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,880
or pr 7789

368
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,720
so expect that to sort of flow into the

369
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,000
document next week or the week after

370
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,199
next slide

371
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,120
um there were some things that was done

372
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,040
after the last

373
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,839
draft was published

374
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,160
because we have been meeting every week

375
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,480
mostly still

376
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,800
so some more clarifications um some

377
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,880
terminology update like not talk about

378
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,720
nest curves because who knows what nist

379
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,959
curves are in this document five years

380
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,480
from now when this has updated their

381
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,880
guidance

382
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,880
some encoding on on npis and values have

383
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,440
been specified more carefully

384
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,760
to map map to nude new algorithms

385
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,600
and sort of that's where we are

386
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,440
so next slide

387
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,560
um

388
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,160
so we think this process is working um

389
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,079
i think we're seeing good progress and

390
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,360
we'd like to continue this way uh but if

391
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,279
anyone has any advice or comments or

392
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,959
suggestions about this

393
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,519
this process of the design team and

394
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,079
please let us know

395
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,720
so we can maybe adapt and be more

396
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,199
inclusive

397
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,360
with that i think um this sort of an

398
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,639
overview

399
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,480
the next slide is the end i think or

400
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,880
this is the last slide yeah

401
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
okay so

402
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,920
any questions comments

403
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,480
then i'll give it back to the chairs

404
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,920
so i guess i'm not sure if everybody's

405
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,240
familiar with how to hit the join cue

406
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,320
button there's a little hand at the top

407
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,399
left of your screen that if you float

408
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,240
over it says join queue so

409
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,759
if anybody wants to do that to ask

410
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,120
questions about the current draft or

411
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,639
design theme process this is a great

412
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,959
time to do it

413
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,199
and

414
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,160
if not we can rattle through the agenda

415
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,480
and revisit any topics like that had any

416
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,759
other business as well

417
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,000
so i guess

418
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,279
next up is

419
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,759
daniel

420
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,399
do you want to drive the slides

421
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,639
uh yeah i'll try

422
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,399
great i clicked the button i don't know

423
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,240
uh what i need to do after that

424
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,160
if when you click share preloaded slides

425
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,199
it should show you a list of options

426
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,880
now it does

427
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,519
so dkg we there's a we get a pop-up that

428
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,440
allows us to give him permission

429
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,279
after he requests it

430
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,199
ah i didn't see that

431
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,479
i was too quick for you that's why

432
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,680
share my videos well

433
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,600
there we go

434
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,480
hello

435
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,519
yes uh it's a bit cut off is that the

436
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,120
case for you as well

437
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,279
no

438
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,560
uh it looks good here

439
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,320
i think it looks

440
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,560
for me the slides are a bit cut off but

441
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,039
that's fine i i know what's on them um

442
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:05,919
okay

443
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:06,720
so

444
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,039
yeah this this presentation is about um

445
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,599
first i'll i'll give a bit of

446
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,000
an overview of the cryptographic

447
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,559
algorithms that were in

448
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,319
rfc 480 and 6637 which

449
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,480
this crypto refresh is

450
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,039
um meant to replace right and then i'll

451
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,360
um give an overview of the

452
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,320
um

453
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,760
the sort of the current consensus more

454
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,760
or less of the design team of

455
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,280
which algorithms should be mandatory

456
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,120
or recommended to implement

457
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,200
uh some of it is

458
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,440
uh you know still more

459
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,559
tentative than other things or some of

460
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,960
these things have had more or less

461
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,480
discussion

462
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,919
uh but um i'll i'll try to make that

463
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,360
clear

464
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,960
um

465
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,640
okay so then

466
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,679
um

467
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,160
as for the cryptic cryptographic

468
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,960
algorithms in rfc 480

469
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,679
um before you all

470
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,559
fall off your chairs at least you know

471
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,000
for the people that are not familiar

472
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,160
with rfc 480

473
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,799
uh you know this document was released

474
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,640
in 2007

475
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,520
um

476
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,640
so you know high time for an update

477
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,360
um but anyway rfc480 says that you must

478
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,320
implement dsa for signing

479
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,039
you must implement algamal for public

480
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,000
key encryption you must implement sha-1

481
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,799
for hashing you must implement triple

482
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,280
des for symmetric encryption

483
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,880
you must implement the cfp mode of

484
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,039
encryption and you must implement the

485
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,400
modification detection code or mdc

486
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,440
um

487
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,080
which is a

488
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,600
method of

489
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,559
integrity protection using

490
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,919
uh xiaowan and then encrypt so you know

491
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,600
obviously

492
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,039
not really

493
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,960
um up to you know modern standards of

494
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,840
uh authenticated

495
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,080
encryption um but okay we'll get to that

496
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,280
and then finally it says that

497
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,080
well finally v4 keys which are the

498
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,799
latest version in rfc4a0

499
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,840
um use sha-1 for fingerprints as well

500
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,480
then it does say you should implement

501
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,799
rsa

502
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:45,880
and

503
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,640
as128 which is at least good it also

504
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,559
says you should

505
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,720
implement cast 5

506
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,000
and zip

507
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,240
and zip is also the default in the sense

508
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,200
that if a key doesn't specify any

509
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
preferences then

510
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,679
um the implementation can assume that it

511
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,960
prefers zip although it's not um

512
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,919
mandatory to

513
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,000
use compression but obviously given the

514
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,240
compression attacks that have come out

515
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,039
more recently it's not ideal

516
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,280
and then finally

517
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,720
the strongest method of

518
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,799
string to key or

519
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,600
password-based key derivation is

520
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,200
um salted and iterated hashing for which

521
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,760
you can use any of the hashes in the

522
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,520
standard

523
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,960
including xiaowan or sha 256

524
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,919
um

525
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,970
but again it's

526
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,200
[Music]

527
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,440
obviously those hashing algorithms are

528
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,120
way too fast and

529
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,520
um it's you know not not a very strong

530
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,960
method of

531
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,640
key derivation

532
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,520
um

533
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,320
then

534
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,360
um

535
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,559
to look on the bright side of rfc480 at

536
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,200
least it does say that you must not use

537
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,360
md5 when signing

538
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,440
although you may still verify it

539
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,400
according to this document at least

540
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,159
to be fair

541
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,360
most

542
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,000
implementations are already way stricter

543
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,760
than this they already

544
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,720
um

545
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,799
i i believe all implementations already

546
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,200
reject any five um

547
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,679
signatures using md5 and some

548
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,000
implementations also reject xiao1

549
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,280
signatures

550
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,679
uh and also just to go back for a second

551
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,400
to the previous slide uh

552
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,640
the the algorithms that are used in in

553
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,720
practice is

554
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,600
uh usually either rsa or ecc

555
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,240
often using curve25509 already even

556
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,000
though it's not in any released um

557
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,559
standard yet and of course all the

558
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,280
implementations are already using aes so

559
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,240
i it's it's not quite as bad

560
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,240
um as this slide may make it seem but um

561
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,200
yeah

562
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,280
um for sure

563
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,120
an update was needed

564
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,520
um then our

565
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,280
does say that

566
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,240
you must not use a symmetric algorithm

567
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,520
that's not in the recipient's

568
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,919
recipient keys

569
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,320
algorithm preferences

570
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,400
so you know the key can say that it

571
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,039
prefers aes and all implementations do i

572
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,000
believe

573
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,200
um

574
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,240
however it does say that uh since triple

575
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,559
des is must implement

576
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,159
then it's uh sort of implicitly in the

577
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,120
um

578
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,960
preferences and you can always use it

579
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,880
and then finally it says that you should

580
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,320
not implement uh keys of less than 1024

581
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,120
bits and that goes for dsa algomal and

582
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,360
rsa

583
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,960
then in

584
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,080
rfc 6637 which is

585
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,039
ecc or elliptic curve cryptography in

586
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,400
open bgp

587
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,159
it says that

588
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,280
you must implement ecdsa for signing and

589
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,960
ecdh for a public key encryption

590
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,840
um

591
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,679
you must implement nist curve p256

592
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,280
you must implement shot to 256

593
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,919
and as128

594
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,679
and as a bonus um sha-1 must not be used

595
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:28,799
um

596
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,360
when using ecc so this this rfc sort of

597
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,400
even though it's um about ecc it kind of

598
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,000
um does or did update the

599
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,400
the mandatory algorithms

600
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,799
um which is good

601
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,640
and then um

602
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,440
it also says that you should implement

603
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,360
uh p521 and you should implement uh sha

604
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,159
384 and sha 512

605
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,200
and

606
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,159
um

607
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,320
it also says you should you should

608
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,760
implement as356

609
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,520
um okay then going ahead to the crypto

610
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,799
refresh

611
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,400
and um this i believe sort of uh as i

612
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,480
said represents the

613
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,520
the consensus of the design team

614
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,600
um but you know if i

615
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,919
misrepresent anything then you can you

616
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,080
know call me out afterwards

617
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,120
um

618
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,520
so what we would like to say in the

619
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,640
crypto refresh is that

620
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,320
you must implement eddsa for signing

621
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,279
and

622
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,840
ecdh uh both using curve2559

623
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,279
and you should implement curve

624
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:48,320
448. um then the hashing algorithms are

625
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,880
the same as

626
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,679
6637

627
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,360
and

628
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,679
similarly

629
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,039
for the aes algorithms

630
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,559
um then uh it says you must implement um

631
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,400
aad for

632
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,640
authenticated encryption

633
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,919
um

634
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,840
then the the specific mode of

635
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,279
aad encryption has not had that much

636
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,760
discussion in the design team but

637
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,440
um i think it would make sense to

638
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,039
require implementing ocb since uh it's a

639
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,240
cfrg requirement currently in the draft

640
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,799
there is ocb and eax

641
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,640
um but ex is not a cfrg or uh sorry

642
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,240
recommendation

643
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,200
um

644
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,240
so to me it would make sense to require

645
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,720
ocb but again this is

646
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,960
uh still up for debate

647
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,919
um

648
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,679
then um

649
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,240
the five keys which are new in this

650
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,360
crypto refresh use uh sha2

651
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,840
um for fingerprints

652
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,559
uh which is well a big part of the

653
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,799
reason for creating v5 keys in the first

654
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,799
place

655
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,240
and then finally um

656
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,080
um the compression algorithm has been

657
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,720
updated from zip to clip

658
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,520
um but um uncompressed is now the

659
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,559
default if the key doesn't specify any

660
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,880
preferences

661
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,679
and then uh argon 2

662
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,200
uh is also recommended for a

663
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,640
password-based key derivation both for

664
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,600
um

665
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,400
you know encrypted uh secret keys and

666
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,679
also for uh messages encrypted with the

667
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,159
password

668
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,679
um

669
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,039
then there are also some deprecations

670
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,080
that um we would like to do in the

671
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,240
crypto refresh um this again has has not

672
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,960
had as much debate as

673
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,840
um

674
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,600
some of the other stuff

675
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,159
um but this is basically one proposal um

676
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,720
so that would be to

677
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,720
um say that implementations must not

678
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,120
generate um rsa keys of less than 2048

679
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,240
bits

680
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,200
um must not encrypt sign or verify using

681
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,320
less than 1024 bits keys

682
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,159
rsa keys

683
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,799
should not encrypt sign or verify using

684
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,159
less than 2048 bit rsa keys and should

685
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,520
not decrypt using less than 1024

686
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,679
1024-bit rsa keys

687
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,360
and then finally

688
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,799
uh and this is perhaps most

689
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,799
controversial um to say that

690
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:44,000
implementations must not

691
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,200
um implement the sa or algamal at all

692
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,120
meaning um

693
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,080
not uh generate encrypt sign verify or

694
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,279
decrypt

695
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,320
um the main reason being

696
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,559
um so there have been

697
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,360
so there has been one paper um

698
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,559
coming out about vulnerabilities

699
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,760
in algomal stemming from you know

700
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,840
differences across different

701
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,840
implementations

702
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,320
and then

703
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,919
my colleague lara brussahini has also

704
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:18,880
um

705
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,080
is also publishing some research about

706
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,960
um

707
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,240
key validation issues or key override

708
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,880
attacks using both dsa and ogamal and um

709
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,960
basically dsa and algamal keys are very

710
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,279
um difficult to

711
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,360
verify

712
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,600
and basically use securely

713
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,880
and in addition to that most of the dsa

714
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,320
and algamal keys out there are

715
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,159
uh

716
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:52,720
1024-bit

717
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,679
keys

718
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:54,799
um

719
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,760
so

720
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,720
most of them are essentially

721
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,039
insecure anyway

722
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,120
um or should not be considered very

723
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,559
secure

724
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,120
but again this is um yeah still up for

725
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,880
debate

726
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,320
okay

727
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,960
then part two of the applications

728
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,880
um is uh we would like to say that

729
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,919
uh you must not use uh md5 sha1 and

730
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,760
ripemd

731
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,080
when signing and i i believe there

732
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,520
there's uh

733
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,720
um

734
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,000
consensus on this or it's it's less um

735
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,760
you know controversial

736
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,520
um

737
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,320
and

738
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,640
um

739
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,919
[Music]

740
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,799
you must not use

741
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,919
md5 sha1 or ripemd

742
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,960
when verifying new signatures and you

743
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,799
should not

744
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,360
use them when verifying old signatures

745
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,320
where old is defined as uh

746
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,159
predating

747
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,440
um

748
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,679
the discovery of uh vulnerabilities in

749
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,840
those specific algorithms

750
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,360
if uh you're sure that the signature has

751
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,840
been under your control

752
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,039
uh

753
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,080
since that time basically

754
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,000
um

755
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,360
and then

756
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,080
we would like to say that

757
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,320
implementations must not encrypt data

758
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,720
with idea triple des or cast 5 but made

759
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,640
still decrypt data

760
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,159
and must not use a

761
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,440
simple

762
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,880
string to key

763
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,840
key derivation meaning the unsalted

764
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,520
variant

765
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,840
and should not use

766
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,480
uh salted but united or non-iterated

767
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,120
string to key

768
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,360
key derivation

769
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,399
unless

770
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:53,520
the

771
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,840
implementation knows that the

772
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,880
the pass phrase is basically a high

773
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,159
entropy

774
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,279
um randomly generated string for example

775
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,279
okay uh then what's still left uh at

776
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,399
least in in terms of uh algorithm

777
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,679
choices

778
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,080
um for the crypto refresh

779
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,279
well one discussion that uh still

780
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,880
needs to happen

781
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,360
uh perhaps in the working group at least

782
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,399
is on brain pool curves

783
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,840
um i i believe the consensus in

784
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,799
the design team is more or less that

785
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,080
it's it's not a cfrg recommendation the

786
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,440
the charter

787
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,080
of this working group does um

788
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,960
explicitly point out that um

789
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,039
the the goal of the working group is to

790
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,360
add curves that are cfrg recommendations

791
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,080
um so that might um

792
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,279
exclude

793
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,120
uh the brain pool curves

794
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,720
but okay that's still up for this

795
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,360
question and then similarly uh for the

796
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,279
mandatory to implement

797
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,320
algorithms there was some question of

798
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,880
um do we want to

799
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,240
require algorithms such that

800
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,880
a minimal implementation is fips

801
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,799
compliant

802
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,600
and uh for now we've

803
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,799
um

804
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,120
sort of decided not to

805
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,480
because

806
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,760
um

807
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,480
we

808
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,360
well there is there is a draft out from

809
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,240
nist

810
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,279
uh which includes uh curve25509

811
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,039
and girl for freight

812
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,840
uh so hopefully that

813
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,880
um

814
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,559
will become a a final document

815
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,360
uh sooner rather than later

816
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,919
and then finally there's um

817
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,840
still some question about should as256

818
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,120
uh be mandatory to implement

819
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,039
the primary

820
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,440
uh argument being

821
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,120
to prepare for

822
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,080
uh post quantum crypto um

823
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,679
given source algorithm and halving the

824
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:08,840
uh search

825
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,440
space um

826
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,320
that being said the the counter argument

827
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,039
would be that um to be

828
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,480
um

829
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,279
both quantum resistant we would need to

830
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,159
do a lot more also you know at post

831
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,399
quantum public key uh encryption

832
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,320
algorithms etc

833
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,279
um

834
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,159
which uh brings me to

835
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,640
um the next slide which is uh what's

836
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,720
next after this uh crypto refresh

837
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,840
um meaning um

838
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,720
if

839
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,559
we were to recharge the the rfc aft the

840
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,200
working group after this rfc has been

841
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,519
released um

842
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,320
in my mind post quantum cryptography

843
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,360
would be um one of the most

844
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,559
uh obvious things to work on next

845
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,919
um

846
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,039
and then

847
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,399
similarly

848
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,200
uh perfect forward secrecy

849
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,159
um

850
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,040
maybe something to look at uh both of

851
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,918
these things though would um you know

852
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,040
require

853
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,679
still a lot more work um

854
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,879
and uh in my personal opinion

855
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,520
um the the work that has been done in

856
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,199
this crypto refresh um is already you

857
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,520
know very important and

858
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,560
um to me it makes sense to

859
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,520
um release an rfc

860
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,399
um

861
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,520
before

862
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,000
these items

863
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,440
okay

864
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,359
that's all from me

865
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,239
any questions

866
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,760
so thanks i i just as you know as a

867
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,520
chair-like thing we really are keen to

868
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,960
get feedback from the broader working

869
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,159
group about these design team uh ideas

870
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,119
um

871
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,400
i mean we can kick off the thread the

872
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,000
main list but that was a really good

873
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,200
chance and i'd really uh be happy to get

874
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,800
feedback whether it's positive negative

875
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,520
or whatever um as it is and again if you

876
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,960
kind of agree with these choices that's

877
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,400
good feedback if you disagree with them

878
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,640
that's also good feedback so please do

879
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,960
join the queue

880
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,359
and or chatting jabber if you have any

881
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,359
such feedback that is an important one

882
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,200
to get broader than the design teams

883
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,240
input

884
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,680
and we have people in the queue so

885
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,960
that's great so

886
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,680
uh clinton go ahead

887
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,280
i'm not saying you're getting sending

888
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,720
audio quinn corn i think you need to

889
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,720
turn on your own audio

890
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,400
we can't turn on your audio for you that

891
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,599
would be a surveillance tool

892
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,880
and again if somebody has audio issues

893
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,560
uh

894
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,320
you can you know feel free to type in

895
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,160
the jabra and we can relay

896
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,000
if need be so queen if you're having

897
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,920
audio issues maybe we'll jump over to

898
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,000
jonathan and uh but stay in the queue

899
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,880
and as you try to resolve things

900
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,359
jonathan

901
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,800
so um

902
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,359
you mentioned post quantum um

903
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,520
do you figure that that would be done

904
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,079
after publishing the crypto refresh that

905
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,480
it would be a net an update after that

906
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,320
or are you going to be holding the

907
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,640
crypto refresh until afternoon this

908
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,320
process completes

909
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,640
i would imagine the former i i would

910
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,640
imagine that this would be one of the

911
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,079
first items after this rfc

912
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,480
uh i i don't think it's

913
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,880
um i i

914
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,280
i don't think it's worth it to hold this

915
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,800
rfc because

916
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,839
um

917
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,119
yeah as i said there are already many

918
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,480
um updates to the cryptographic

919
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,680
algorithms um in this crypto refresh

920
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,640
that are

921
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,280
long overdue in my personal opinion

922
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,400
um

923
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,920
so i i think it's worth it to get that

924
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,040
out

925
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,280
even without the

926
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,599
[Music]

927
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,480
post quantum algorithms also given that

928
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,359
the

929
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,640
nest competition if you will is uh still

930
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,440
not

931
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,720
completed so it might still

932
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,880
take a while to

933
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,570
get that done

934
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:26,669
[Music]

935
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,760
okay quinn

936
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,440
just as a reminder also folks you need

937
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,040
to take yourself out of the queue if you

938
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,800
would by clicking again on the hand

939
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,480
button when you're done that helps us to

940
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,000
the queue engine thanks so much you can

941
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,400
go ahead thank you griffin um ready for

942
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,200
that i just admitted myself um

943
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,880
i uploaded uploading the the team um for

944
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,119
working on this i think

945
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,359
the work has been done really nicely i

946
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,440
see a lot of good stuff over there

947
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,720
um

948
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,720
i i really do hope and you know we we

949
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,280
have some some some

950
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,480
um

951
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,800
some options so that you know people who

952
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,040
who want to use fips validated uh

953
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,960
modules for for for their security

954
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,079
purposes

955
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,640
um to be able to get you know approved

956
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,520
or

957
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,560
allowed

958
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,119
in many places outside u.s government as

959
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,960
well um i know

960
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,040
in europe in asia

961
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,620
in in

962
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,800
[Music]

963
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,560
many places but

964
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,640
for sure i don't know exactly how it has

965
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,960
been used you know in in

966
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,359
in what places but i expect they've been

967
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,960
used um everywhere and a lot um

968
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,079
and uh that applies to pgp software as

969
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,839
well

970
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,440
for the ocb personally i like it but

971
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,200
right now we don't have

972
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,040
a plan to prove it

973
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,920
so

974
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,000
um

975
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,160
for the curves

976
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,040
we

977
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,280
we we want to prove the cubes and the

978
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,240
new uh nsa signatures with those two

979
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,400
curves from the cfrg

980
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,480
and we thank you sebajee for for doing

981
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,800
that um making uh

982
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,960
faster curves and and

983
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,200
with you know more properties that

984
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,480
people like

985
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,320
um

986
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,359
so i expect um

987
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,599
those curves and

988
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,480
um signature algorithms will be approved

989
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,880
at some points in the officially in the

990
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,160
future um right now you cannot get them

991
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,280
validated yet because it's not

992
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,200
officially approved yet uh we're waiting

993
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,800
for a you know a big signature on it and

994
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,599
um you know it's

995
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:44,400
it's

996
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,480
it's been a while um so i'm i'm on

997
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,400
behalf of this i'm sorry for that i i

998
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,240
think it needs to be speeded up

999
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,530
um

1000
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,920
[Music]

1001
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,200
uh for the uh e

1002
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,359
i i don't think we we're going to prove

1003
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,760
eax uh either um

1004
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,480
we we haven't talked about that uh for a

1005
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,960
while um because we right now we expect

1006
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,240
to have

1007
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,240
a new algorithms or of a few for the

1008
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,160
lightweight crypto

1009
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,760
and

1010
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,160
some of them might be just good at

1011
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,800
general purpose use as well

1012
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,760
um so so um i

1013
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,880
so i participation and wait for that i

1014
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,000
think um

1015
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
we will have um

1016
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,040
one or two or so good candidates um for

1017
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,359
lightweight crypto coming out

1018
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,680
in the news

1019
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,160
uh tcm is okay

1020
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,440
gm is is is good we

1021
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,160
um we don't have any plan to

1022
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,399
um

1023
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,560
to remove it it's good

1024
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,880
um

1025
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,400
yeah

1026
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,599
makes sense

1027
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,400
thanks a lot for your comments yeah so

1028
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,680
gcm is not currently in the in the

1029
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,400
crypto refresh i i suppose that could

1030
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
still be

1031
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,040
a topic for discussion if

1032
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,000
um

1033
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,720
people feel that having a

1034
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,720
nist approved

1035
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,960
authenticated encryption mode is

1036
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,720
valuable we do

1037
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,079
um implement it in openphp.js and google

1038
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,680
pgp as an

1039
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,200
experimental

1040
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,920
module a remote even though of course

1041
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,920
gcm is not experimental but in the

1042
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,040
context of open bgp

1043
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,240
it is

1044
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,920
um

1045
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,720
but um but yeah

1046
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,800
we we we could um if the team um

1047
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,200
agreed to you know we we could have uh

1048
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,359
ocp or something else you know uh

1049
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,359
another good crypto to be in the

1050
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,440
recommended should

1051
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,640
uh implement um

1052
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,640
column

1053
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,800
yeah makes sense

1054
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,119
great thanks quinn and again if you're

1055
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,000
uh

1056
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,079
if you can dequeue yourself after when

1057
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,280
you're done that that helps so it

1058
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,040
depends

1059
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,480
thank you stefan

1060
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,920
thank you a lot yeah

1061
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,720
thank you uh i just wanted to hop in on

1062
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,960
the post quantum crypto topic because i

1063
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,720
had come up a little bit earlier

1064
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,640
uh so we are currently working to

1065
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,160
charter a

1066
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,200
semi-dedicated working group for

1067
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,960
um

1068
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,240
the word maintenance has been used it's

1069
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,520
not a great word but for like sort of

1070
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,280
adding the ability to use post quantum

1071
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,880
crypto to

1072
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,119
algorithms and protocols or protocols

1073
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,760
mostly that don't currently support it

1074
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,920
and do not have a better home

1075
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,520
obviously if this working group is going

1076
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,319
to stay open it would be a fine place to

1077
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,880
add post quantum crypto to pgp

1078
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,240
but this other working group that we're

1079
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,040
working on will be a body of expertise

1080
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,520
in that general topic and we would

1081
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,520
want to be able to

1082
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,520
coordinate with them when we do start

1083
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,319
picking up the postcard work but

1084
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,880
i agree with you that uh we should not

1085
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,119
try to do it in the current document

1086
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,680
that we're working on thanks

1087
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,839
makes sense yeah we should uh

1088
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:27,839
collaborate on that obviously

1089
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,560
hi um paul speaking just as an

1090
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,760
individual

1091
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,280
i just want to remind people as well

1092
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,160
that

1093
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,160
whatever we decide for the mandatory to

1094
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,079
implement even though it's a base in the

1095
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,000
document that we're producing

1096
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,160
um we should also

1097
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,920
in parallel

1098
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,160
you know revise these anyway and so

1099
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,960
maybe six months or 12 months after we

1100
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,359
after this rfc is published we will do

1101
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,119
an update to the mandatory to implement

1102
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,280
section um i have done those kind of

1103
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,240
documents for uh for dns for ike for

1104
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,920
ipsec

1105
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,160
that is very common way of doing it and

1106
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,839
then making sure that the iana

1107
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,839
registries have enough information that

1108
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,319
implementers can go there and see why

1109
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,920
certain

1110
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,480
what the status is of certain algorithms

1111
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,079
and and why they might have been like

1112
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,079
independently

1113
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,480
yeah i believe dkg has also been working

1114
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,079
on uh

1115
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,560
updating those tables also indeed so

1116
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,760
that we can

1117
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,640
um

1118
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,160
update them

1119
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,680
in in the iana tables without um

1120
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,880
necessarily

1121
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,040
releasing a new document right correct

1122
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,280
me if i'm wrong

1123
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,440
yeah that's correct i mean part of the

1124
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,440
the updates that are in crypto refresh

1125
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,480
is um changing the rules for how we

1126
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,880
add items to these tables

1127
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,640
um to make it to loosen them up a little

1128
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,920
bit it had been

1129
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,760
relatively uh

1130
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,280
strict before and i think we're moving

1131
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,240
in the direction of it being looser

1132
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,800
okay so i don't see anybody else in the

1133
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,480
queue

1134
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,599
i guess they're probably a good um

1135
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,920
action to put on the chairs and design

1136
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,160
team members i guess send a summary

1137
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,000
about this mti topic to the working

1138
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,359
group list

1139
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,280
um because i do expect to be more

1140
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,119
discussion needed just to check

1141
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,200
everybody's ideas about this

1142
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,040
um so that's probably a useful one for

1143
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,720
the notes is just to put an action on

1144
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,640
the the chairs to create it or start a

1145
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,839
mail thread

1146
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:37,359
when the design team thinks it's

1147
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,640
finished

1148
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,640
with the mti topic is to validate that

1149
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,118
with list

1150
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,119
and if there's nobody else in queue i

1151
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,800
guess that brings us to the next one

1152
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,760
which is another daniel

1153
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,839
um

1154
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,240
hi folks i'm going to try sending video

1155
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,760
here we'll see if my laptop can handle

1156
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,560
it

1157
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,839
um so

1158
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,640
this is uh just a brief discussion about

1159
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,880
the stateless open pgp interface which

1160
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,440
is a command line interface

1161
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,280
this is not technically in chartered

1162
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,960
work

1163
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,960
for this working group

1164
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,040
but the idea is that it is an abstract

1165
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,640
interface for the things that people

1166
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,000
might want from openpgp

1167
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,400
that is the users of openbgb

1168
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,079
and it is deliberately agnostic to some

1169
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,400
of the wire format details

1170
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,800
um it's called the stateless open pgp

1171
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,760
interface so we abbreviate that to sap

1172
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,839
and it's um

1173
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,599
stateless meaning that there's no weird

1174
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,440
side effects right that everything that

1175
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,839
you specify is going to be uh directly

1176
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:46,240
there it's on the command line so

1177
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,800
uh why am i talking about this here

1178
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,720
given that it's not in charter

1179
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,760
um

1180
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,839
i'm mentioning it because it has proven

1181
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,680
to be useful for interoperability

1182
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,640
testing

1183
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,760
and that's something that we care about

1184
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,119
a lot as we're building this crypto

1185
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,040
refresh track we want to make sure that

1186
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,160
we actually have functional

1187
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,920
implementations

1188
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,000
i think it also is helpful in clarifying

1189
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,240
the concepts that users of openpgp are

1190
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,680
likely to want to do and it tries to be

1191
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,000
very simple in in describing um

1192
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,079
behaviors that that users will find

1193
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,760
useful

1194
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,280
and hopefully it will encourage best

1195
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,680
practices and implementations as well

1196
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,839
to ensure that that things behave the

1197
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,680
way that we sort of expect them to this

1198
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,839
could help with algorithm deprecation as

1199
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,359
well as support for new algorithms

1200
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,079
so uh

1201
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,400
again it's stateless because we really

1202
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,160
want to make sure that there's no

1203
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,760
strange side effects that if you run it

1204
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,839
once you get the sort of the the same

1205
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,839
thing uh this does not mean it's the

1206
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,400
right way to use it um

1207
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,760
uh

1208
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,040
that you should always use something

1209
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,040
like sop in an implementation but it is

1210
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,640
definitely useful for exercising

1211
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,839
implementations to make sure that they

1212
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,119
do what people expect um

1213
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:00,559
uh

1214
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,040
we also think that the reason we chose a

1215
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,559
command line sorry daniel i think i'm

1216
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,599
getting echo from your audio

1217
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,119
thanks

1218
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,160
uh which is command line because it's

1219
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,599
sort of common dominator we have lots of

1220
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,280
different implementations they're in

1221
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,720
different languages

1222
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,440
and would be nice to make sure that that

1223
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,040
we can test them with each other

1224
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,880
without having one particular language

1225
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,880
be uh the

1226
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,400
framework that that everybody has to

1227
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,400
sort of push themselves into pretty much

1228
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,760
everybody can build a command line tool

1229
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,280
um

1230
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,280
so uh at the moment the softcraft uh is

1231
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,240
focused on data management there is a

1232
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,319
secret key and certificate generation

1233
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,920
utility in it

1234
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,280
um the interface describes encrypting

1235
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,920
again very very minimal controls uh

1236
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,599
we're not it's not the kind of thing you

1237
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,280
could say do it with this particular

1238
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,680
algorithm we just want to say do it and

1239
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,520
then see what it was generated by

1240
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,760
default um and then can other can other

1241
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,079
implementations read

1242
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,040
the

1243
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,079
encrypted

1244
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,559
um we also do signature identification

1245
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,720
so it goes on data management

1246
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,160
it doesn't get into any of the funky

1247
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,160
certificate off at a moment

1248
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,119
um

1249
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,880
so here's some examples of how you would

1250
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,800
use it on the command line

1251
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,079
ben

1252
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,640
sorry to jump in uh speaking your audio

1253
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,319
is getting a little choppy so maybe if

1254
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,160
you turn off your video

1255
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,319
your laptop will have

1256
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:29,599
more cpu for the audio cycle

1257
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,200
thank you i turned off my video

1258
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,040
hopefully this will be better appreciate

1259
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,720
the heads up

1260
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,960
um

1261
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,680
uh yeah so this is an example of how the

1262
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,920
uh how you might use sop

1263
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,440
um

1264
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,920
there's a key generation you can extract

1265
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,960
the public key the the certificate from

1266
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,480
the secret key

1267
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,680
um

1268
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,640
you can

1269
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,319
sign verify encrypt etc

1270
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,720
so hopefully that makes uh some sense if

1271
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,160
you just take a look at that you can see

1272
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,760
the standard input and standard output

1273
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,480
are

1274
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,079
are used there

1275
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,920
um

1276
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,800
so

1277
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,480
um

1278
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,480
right so why do we care about this with

1279
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,839
the crypto refresh document

1280
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,480
we care because we don't want to expose

1281
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,480
the algorithm specific details the

1282
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,559
version specific details but we do want

1283
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,240
to see whether you can consume objects

1284
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,079
that are created like this

1285
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,680
so that means that the interop test

1286
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,680
suite can take a wire format object and

1287
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,839
say hey who can read this thing

1288
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:33,280
um or who can encrypt to this key um

1289
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,160
uh

1290
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,359
and and

1291
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:36,960
we've found that's pretty useful in

1292
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,040
identifying uh incompatibilities

1293
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,000
actually with the existing rfc 4880

1294
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,359
and hopefully it will be more useful

1295
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:44,640
going forward with the stuff that's in

1296
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,440
the crypto refresh as well

1297
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,960
so if folks see

1298
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,200
issues or concerns with this you know i

1299
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,520
hope you'll speak up and

1300
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,200
you know we can propose changes to the

1301
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,160
framework

1302
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,520
as well as

1303
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,400
new kinds of tests

1304
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,720
users will talk about the test a little

1305
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,118
bit later

1306
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,000
a couple of things uh about what might

1307
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,680
change in stop in the future one thing

1308
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,960
that's missing is inline signatures

1309
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,240
uh current sop draft really expects to

1310
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,559
work with detached signatures so you

1311
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:19,839
have the data that's signed and you have

1312
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,359
a separate signature

1313
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,760
this is much cleaner to reason about

1314
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,160
but in fact we do have an open pgp

1315
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,880
bundled signature and message objects

1316
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,720
and we have a history of some kind of

1317
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,319
failure with that we need to figure out

1318
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,160
how to represent that in

1319
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,839
soft and we haven't done it yet it's

1320
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:39,680
issue 25 the links are in the slides um

1321
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,119
there'll be a link at the end as well if

1322
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,760
you want to see that

1323
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,440
one thing that's been really interesting

1324
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,200
over the last year is we have three

1325
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,839
different language specific frameworks

1326
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,839
um so if you're writing an open pgp

1327
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,760
implementation in java in rust or in

1328
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,920
python you can pull in these language

1329
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,440
specific frameworks and they'll they'll

1330
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,119
auto generate the command line interface

1331
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,720
for you

1332
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,839
in general the language specific

1333
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,520
frameworks are kind of idiomatic for the

1334
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,200
specific language which i think is good

1335
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,240
there's been some talk about trying to

1336
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,160
write up a c

1337
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,160
framework for it so you could use an

1338
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,760
implementation as a shared library that

1339
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,760
hasn't been done yet but if you want to

1340
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,200
help work on that that's something that

1341
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,119
would also be useful or in any other

1342
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,960
language feel free to try to build

1343
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,680
something that maps to this

1344
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,200
interface should make things easier

1345
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,640
other thing that

1346
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,559
has been sort of pending for a while but

1347
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,319
nobody's bothered to specify it our

1348
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,319
certificate management functions so

1349
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,440
again we've really only been handling

1350
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,599
data management thus far but it might be

1351
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:40,880
nice to be able to merge certificates

1352
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,559
together you know certificates have

1353
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:43,440
multiple

1354
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,880
multiple certifications in them you'd

1355
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,559
like to merge them together and get the

1356
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,040
union of those verifications

1357
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,079
um

1358
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,119
validation of user ids

1359
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,680
people call the web of trust

1360
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,280
maintaining a certificate so if you have

1361
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,040
a secret key do you need to do any

1362
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,400
updates to it like what if it's

1363
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,960
advertising support for md5 it'd be nice

1364
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,319
to be able to say

1365
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,040
no let's remove that advertisement um

1366
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,200
issuing replications certifying other

1367
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,440
user ids that sort of thing adding sub

1368
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,720
keys maybe

1369
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,400
these are things that that might be

1370
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,920
useful to add but we don't need to get

1371
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,760
into the details here uh hopefully folks

1372
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,599
will consider doing that on the issue

1373
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,920
tracker

1374
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,480
the recent update that was pushed out a

1375
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,400
couple of weeks ago has very minor

1376
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,480
changes a little bit of tweaking

1377
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,240
uh letting you use multiple secret keys

1378
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,680
where you used to only be able to use

1379
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,680
one and a bit more

1380
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,079
expanded output for the version function

1381
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,119
which will help report better detail in

1382
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,079
the test suite

1383
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,040
um so that's a rough overview of what

1384
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,960
the what sap is what the stateless

1385
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,720
openpgp interface is

1386
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,720
um i hope folks will take a look at that

1387
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,800
if you're an implementer and you haven't

1388
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,640
got a sop implementation

1389
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,119
um or no one's written one for you

1390
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,119
i encourage you to take a look uh the

1391
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:00,720
more that you have a sap implementation

1392
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,720
that you feel comfortable with the

1393
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,480
better represented you'll be in the

1394
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,359
interrupt testing

1395
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,960
so if folks have questions about sop

1396
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,280
itself i'm happy to take them now

1397
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,200
i believe useless will talk about the

1398
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,880
the most exciting use of saap in the

1399
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,559
next presentation which is the interop

1400
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,400
test suite

1401
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,760
anybody have any thoughts or suggestions

1402
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,520
i am happy to

1403
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,200
see the ground for useless if you want

1404
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,160
to come up for the next talk

1405
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,240
so i also want to mention that um the

1406
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,480
idea of having you know language

1407
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,640
specific apis

1408
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,319
kind of standardized by sub is also

1409
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,640
useful for application developers

1410
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,599
so if you are looking into

1411
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,400
using pgp in some kind of application or

1412
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,079
server side application

1413
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,520
maybe sub is a good fit for you

1414
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,160
can you hear me

1415
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,400
you heard you

1416
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,400
okay

1417
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,319
great directors

1418
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:13,760
no one else in the queue again if you

1419
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,599
want to join the queue now that's fine

1420
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,520
uh if you want to join at the end at the

1421
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,960
end that's also fine so if there's

1422
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,880
nobody else into justice you're next up

1423
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,920
anyway so

1424
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,559
giving you permission for loading slides

1425
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,119
place it up

1426
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:36,160
here okay

1427
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,319
hi

1428
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,319
so

1429
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:43,680
i'm going to

1430
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,880
talk about the test suite again

1431
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,520
on the slide there are two urls on the

1432
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,359
first one you can see the

1433
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:52,480
current

1434
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,880
test suite results

1435
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,280
updated whenever i get around to run the

1436
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,880
test suite again

1437
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,240
and the

1438
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,599
slides will be uploaded to our website

1439
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,920
as well

1440
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,799
so if you missed the last presentation

1441
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,559
um

1442
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,880
there are around 90 tests in the test

1443
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,559
suite currently

1444
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,359
and all in all we are feeding around 800

1445
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:23,839
test vectors to every implementation

1446
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,960
some test vectors are you know created

1447
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,799
by the test suite and some test vectors

1448
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:33,760
are created by implementations

1449
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,079
so the more implementations

1450
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,160
we add to the test suite the more test

1451
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,879
vectors there will be

1452
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,960
is my video okay

1453
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,160
i hope so we don't actually see uh you

1454
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,680
just but uh we hear you fine and

1455
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,359
there's some non

1456
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,799
moving video of a an avatar icon

1457
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:05,119
that's odd well yeah i agree but feel

1458
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:07,119
free to proceed i mean i think the audio

1459
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,880
is the more important thing anyway

1460
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,240
yeah

1461
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,720
so i'm happy to report that we found at

1462
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,359
least 92 bucks in 10 different

1463
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:17,280
implementations

1464
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,160
um

1465
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,040
which i'm very very happy about

1466
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,280
and i think it also improved

1467
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,799
implementations a lot and our

1468
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:27,119
understanding of the p2p ecosystem in

1469
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:28,640
general

1470
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,760
and i'm

1471
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,640
very hopeful that it has already been

1472
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,640
helpful with the standardization process

1473
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,599
because

1474
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:38,319
it highlights

1475
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:41,520
areas where the spec

1476
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,400
is somewhat fuzzy and we could

1477
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,680
lend more

1478
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,040
guidance to implementations

1479
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,319
so if you look at how the test suite

1480
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:53,839
works

1481
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:56,240
we're doing black box testing and we're

1482
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,440
using the

1483
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,240
stateless open pg pgp interface that

1484
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,200
daniel introduced

1485
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,799
you know it was created in the context

1486
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,400
of the test suite

1487
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,720
so this is the main consumer but i'm

1488
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,000
very happy with extending the

1489
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,599
sub

1490
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,119
beyond the test suite

1491
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,599
many tests there are two kinds of tests

1492
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,640
one where the test suite creates test

1493
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,559
artifacts and feeds them to the

1494
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,799
implementations and the other one where

1495
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,000
we do

1496
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,839
uh

1497
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:36,240
maybe more traditional interop testing

1498
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,280
where

1499
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,319
we

1500
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:40,880
for example ask some implementation to

1501
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,119
encrypt the file and then we try to

1502
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,880
decrypt it with every other

1503
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,280
implementation

1504
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,280
and

1505
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,200
you can see an example of the

1506
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,160
uh

1507
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,520
how to use sop

1508
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,839
you can generate a key sign a message

1509
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:02,000
with it and then use a different

1510
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,520
implementation tool

1511
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,079
to verify

1512
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,319
the

1513
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,480
signature

1514
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,000
if you look to the right there is an

1515
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,680
example

1516
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,520
of the test because if you look at the

1517
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,680
test results it's a bit unwieldy and

1518
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,720
maybe overwhelming

1519
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,680
to the left you see

1520
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,839
the test artifact or the producer

1521
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:30,000
most tests start with the base case to

1522
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,520
establish that the

1523
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,040
kind of setting is

1524
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,319
sane

1525
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:38,000
and works as we expect

1526
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,119
and then

1527
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,960
most of the time if we have a consumer

1528
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:41,920
test

1529
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,599
we

1530
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:44,880
start

1531
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,400
uh with a well-formed variant or a form

1532
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,160
variant maybe

1533
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,160
some kind of weird or slightly out of

1534
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,960
spec variant

1535
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,880
and then if you look at the columns

1536
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,520
you see the consumers

1537
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,359
um

1538
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:05,680
and to the right there is an expectation

1539
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,559
so

1540
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:08,319
some of the test vectors have an

1541
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,079
expectation

1542
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,920
um

1543
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,040
or mostly my expectation

1544
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,880
and or a comment

1545
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,240
and the

1546
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,319
the colors in the

1547
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:22,400
boxes indicate whether

1548
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,200
the implementation's outcome matches the

1549
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,640
expectations

1550
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,319
so green background or

1551
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:33,440
earmark in the top left corner means the

1552
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,480
implementation matches the expectation

1553
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,640
and the red background or

1554
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,200
an earmark in the top right corner means

1555
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,839
it did not

1556
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:48,319
[Music]

1557
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,200
so

1558
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:53,760
we hope to use the test suite

1559
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,040
extensively

1560
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,119
in the process of

1561
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,640
producing the crypto refresh

1562
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,359
it's a bit

1563
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,440
tricky because

1564
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,119
most artifacts

1565
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:08,720
in the case of consumer tests are

1566
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,480
created by sequoia

1567
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,000
and if sequoia does not implement the

1568
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,520
feature yet we can't use it to

1569
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,599
generate an artifact

1570
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:19,839
but i'm not above

1571
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:23,040
simply using files to

1572
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,040
um

1573
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,040
to fill in the gaps where sequoia does

1574
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,680
not or does not yet implement some

1575
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,000
feature

1576
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,200
and then we can have a

1577
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,960
specific subset of tests that we somehow

1578
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:39,920
attack

1579
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,760
that are only relevant for the crippler

1580
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,599
refresh

1581
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,079
and we can also

1582
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,400
test

1583
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:51,359
unreleased or in development versions of

1584
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,520
implementations

1585
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,119
and publish this subset of

1586
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,400
of results

1587
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,839
in a different place

1588
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:04,079
and hopefully in the end

1589
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:06,880
we'll get well understood and

1590
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,960
easy to implement back

1591
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,079
out of it and also hopefully speed of

1592
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:13,839
adoption of the

1593
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:16,720
crypto refresh

1594
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,079
so

1595
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:20,799
if you want to help that would be great

1596
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:23,200
so it would be very useful to

1597
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,520
come up come up with a

1598
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,760
list of relevant tests

1599
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,799
and also it would be great

1600
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:32,559
to get some help with actually writing

1601
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,599
these tests that may be a bit

1602
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:38,079
big ask because the tests are written in

1603
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,119
rust

1604
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:41,359
but

1605
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:43,920
maybe

1606
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,760
people can still

1607
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,079
contribute at least ideas or specific

1608
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:49,440
guidance on

1609
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,839
what would be useful to test

1610
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:52,880
and then

1611
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:57,039
once the tests are written and executed

1612
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,599
reviewing the results and

1613
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,839
providing feedback that is also a lot of

1614
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:04,720
work and

1615
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,359
you could help with that too

1616
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:08,480
and now

1617
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,559
if you want to participate in

1618
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,119
this experiment as an implementer

1619
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:15,359
that would be also great

1620
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,599
and there are

1621
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,200
two problems

1622
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,960
first if you don't have a sub

1623
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,559
implementation

1624
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,240
it would be great if you if you would

1625
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,480
write one

1626
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,680
and

1627
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,039
then

1628
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:30,880
i would need

1629
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,240
i would love to have specific

1630
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,559
instruction on you know how to get that

1631
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,880
implementation how to build it

1632
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,119
and most importantly how to update the

1633
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:40,799
the implementation

1634
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,599
that is a bit of a problem right now

1635
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:46,559
for the test suite because

1636
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:49,359
unfortunately i'm the only one who

1637
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,680
um who runs the test suite

1638
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,280
and i don't have a good trigger

1639
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,720
mechanism

1640
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:59,359
on when to run the test suit again

1641
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,119
in general

1642
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:03,680
if you want to participate please get in

1643
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,880
touch and be responsive

1644
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,680
that would be great

1645
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,720
as a summary

1646
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,400
this is a bit of a rehash of the

1647
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,280
last presentation

1648
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,880
if you want to help

1649
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,000
please suggest tests or even better

1650
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,760
write tests

1651
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,039
you can

1652
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:29,839
open an issue in the issue tracker for

1653
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:31,039
that

1654
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:32,480
if you want to participate as an

1655
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,039
implementation in the interop testing

1656
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:37,839
that would be great

1657
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,039
the best option is to

1658
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,200
implement the sub

1659
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,640
interface

1660
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,839
i implemented sub interfaces for

1661
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:50,720
gpgme and rnp

1662
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,720
and sequoia

1663
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,640
and i'm kind of maintaining the sub

1664
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,079
interface for

1665
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:59,359
gpgme and rnp

1666
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:01,280
and

1667
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,240
you know

1668
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:06,000
that could lead to me misrepresenting

1669
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,640
your implementation and if i do please

1670
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,319
talk to me or

1671
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,240
you know even better

1672
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,590
write your own implementation

1673
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:15,039
[Music]

1674
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:18,240
and finally i encode lots of my own

1675
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,680
expectations into the test suite and i

1676
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,160
maybe wrong about

1677
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,720
stuff so if you

1678
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,720
disagree with some test results or with

1679
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,959
some

1680
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:32,720
expectations

1681
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,880
please also talk to me

1682
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,319
on the right you see

1683
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:41,039
kind of a short how to get started with

1684
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:43,119
the implementation

1685
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:46,000
in top testing

1686
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,920
and in general um this has been a bit of

1687
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,280
a one-man show which is a bit

1688
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,640
unfortunate i don't mind the work but

1689
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,960
um it would be great to get more people

1690
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,559
involved and

1691
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,079
maybe you can have a bit of a chat on

1692
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,160
what the barriers

1693
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,760
are to

1694
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,319
to joining and how we can improve that

1695
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,200
and with that i'd like to open up four

1696
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,200
questions

1697
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,400
so i just want to point out that

1698
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,559
um the work uses done here has really

1699
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:33,359
been super valuable to the community and

1700
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:35,359
it actually is as easy as it as it shows

1701
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:36,960
to run the test suite

1702
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,319
um

1703
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:41,520
it's a pretty straightforward process

1704
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,400
so

1705
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,680
i want to say

1706
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,359
a big thanks to eustis for doing this

1707
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:48,559
this is this is really critical for us

1708
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:51,599
uh ben go ahead

1709
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,319
and basically say the same thing uh not

1710
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:57,039
a question but a huge thanks for getting

1711
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:58,640
the test suite together and maintaining

1712
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,520
it i know some of the other itf work

1713
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,319
we've done recently with like tls and

1714
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,200
quick

1715
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,280
have had a good

1716
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,400
interop test matrix with many different

1717
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,799
implementations and that really

1718
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:15,520
improved the quality of the spec

1719
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,559
to have so many different

1720
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:19,200
implementations that were

1721
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,799
following with a spec and pointing out

1722
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:23,119
bugs or inconsistencies or incomplete

1723
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:24,559
parts of the spec

1724
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:26,000
so it's really

1725
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,039
really useful to have this sort of

1726
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,880
automated test suite available so thank

1727
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,839
you again for doing it

1728
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:50,799
okay um thanks jesus and again people

1729
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,400
you know you have links there please

1730
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,480
keep an eye on them and and download it

1731
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,480
twice

1732
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,720

1733
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,720

1736
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,238
um

1737
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:18,158
this is our agenda we're at the aob part

1738
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:21,439
now um so

1739
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:25,120
any other business any anybody want to

1740
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,719
jump back in the queue and revisit

1741
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:28,000
topics we covered earlier there's a bit

1742
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,600
of time i have like two minutes but you

1743
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,120
guys have no 50 minutes if you want

1744
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:37,120
and i'll be here after uh stephen steps

1745
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:40,560
off if if there is aob going on

1746
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,439
but if there is no other aob um i'm

1747
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:44,640
happy to

1748
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,040
give y'all a chunk of the meeting time

1749
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,040
back

1750
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:53,359
um

1751
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:54,158
the

1752
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:56,158
weekly the weekly meetings of the design

1753
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:58,479
team have been uh ongoing uh we spent

1754
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:01,040
about an hour uh every week

1755
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,439
uh together and probably a significant

1756
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,600
amount of time more than that between

1757
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,799
the meetings

1758
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:09,279
uh tweaking at the specs so i think that

1759
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:11,198
the design team folks are

1760
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:13,198
might be might be meeting out then go

1761
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:14,479
ahead

1762
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:17,279
yeah sorry i skipped training queue

1763
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,399
because it was just me but um

1764
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:21,759
i

1765
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:23,759
want to thank again the design team for

1766
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,279
all the great work they're doing do you

1767
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,279
have a sense for if we can try and

1768
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:29,600
extrapolate from the current rate of

1769
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,000
progress in the design team for

1770
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,399
looking forward

1771
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,319
how do we have an estimate for when

1772
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,158
we'll be able to be

1773
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:40,158
going to say working group last call or

1774
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:42,879
anything like that

1775
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:50,080
um predicting the future is always hard

1776
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,120
uh but i would hope that early in 2022

1777
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,040
we'll have working group last call

1778
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,480
um i don't think we have a lot left

1779
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,520
but you know it's possible that we

1780
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,920
stumble on some of these last points

1781
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,280
um of course yeah okay thanks that's

1782
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,199
pretty reassuring to hear so i look

1783
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:10,320
forward to it

1784
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,960
and i think uh jonathan was maybe in the

1785
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,960
queue

1786
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,080
the same question it's been answered

1787
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,400
thanks

1788
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:31,839
okay um i see steven has stepped away

1789
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,280
i see steven has stepped away

1790
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:45,719
hello

1791
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,040
um so i see steven has stepped away

1792
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,880
um i don't know whether y'all can hear

1793
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,040
me

1794
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,320

yeah so it looks like stephen has

1798
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,120
stepped away but uh if we don't have

1799

01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,800
meetings and we'll continue posting

1816
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,760
