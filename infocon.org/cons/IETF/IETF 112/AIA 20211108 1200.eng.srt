not aware either

28
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,639
on what's up i think the new format of

29
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,360
logging in may have caused a little bit

30
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
of time delay i know it did for me and i

31
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,800
want to apologize to everyone for being

32
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,400
a little late um

33
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,880
my father had a

34
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,600
a heart stroke over the uh on friday so

35
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,840
i had to come up to be with my mother so

36
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,719
give me one second

37
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,560
i'm sorry

38
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,800
but bear in mind this is the session is

39
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,280
broadcasted on youtube

40
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,880
it's like

41
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,479
life is different these days that's for

42
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,159
sure um hang on one sec

43
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,319
so well in any way we can i think we can

44
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,720
we can start and then we can adjust the

45
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,360
agenda according to the people present

46
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,680
and then

47
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,440
so well um

48
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,360
as usual

49
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,880
bear in mind that we have the noteworld

50
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,000
slides about the intellectual property

51
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,599
and

52
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,080
in what we agree when we participate in

53
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,039
the irdf

54
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,520
if you know of any

55
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,199
contribution covered by patents or

56
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,199
patent applications you should disclose

57
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,039
it and not or not participate in the

58
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,479
discussion

59
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,919
and um i think it's

60
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,199
it's it's not well and it is well known

61
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,000
in all the idf meetings

62
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,240
um

63
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,080
and you know that the recording is made

64
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,160
public in fact is broadcasted on youtube

65
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,960
um

66
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,800
and this is the police private privacy

67
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,000
policy and and you know we have to talk

68
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,520
with respect and

69
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
there are rfcs about

70
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,560
how to how to behave

71
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,440
and then

72
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,360
you know that the irtf is about

73
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,800
conducting research it's not about

74
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,960
developing standards but it's connected

75
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,560
to the itf

76
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,840
activities related to standard

77
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,639
development

78
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,840
and

79
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,080
and we have published in fact one rfc

80
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,399
that today where i was going to discuss

81
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,279
about

82
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,279
how to revise it and update it

83
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,120
and then just a reminder of the charter

84
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,799
of the gaia

85
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,800
working group

86
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,600
uh

87
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,080
that is about the reality of

88
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,519
of the digital divide that we are

89
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,360
just successful with half of the

90
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,040
population let's say

91
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,880
but there is

92
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,560
there are barriers

93
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,920
and there are

94
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,360
in participation

95
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,279
and these are this is the list of

96
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,880
individual objectives but i won't go

97
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,360
into detail here as usual it's it's

98
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,320
there you can look at it later on on the

99
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,839
repository

100
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,440
with the slides

101
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,080
and then going to the um core of the

102
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
meeting today uh

103
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,399
we we scheduled um

104
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,640

um and um a third one from marco cenaro

112
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,640
and then in the last item we are going

113
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,120
to go through the some slides and some

114
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,399
discussion on um on the revision of the

115
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,920
rfc that we produced several years ago

116
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,560
so this is more or less the the agenda

117
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,800
you know that

118
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,680
there is the chat uh

119
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,279
channel as well

120
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,560
and um

121
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,160
and as i said the beginning

122
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,000
if you can upload and i i need to do

123
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,959
that too are the slides on on the data

124
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,120
tracker that allows people

125
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,560
to facilitate

126
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,079
process especially if you cannot for

127
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,240
some reason share the screen

128
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,320
or if you come later you can look at the

129
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,800
slides later on

130
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,880
so um

131
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,120
they got in the um

132
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,079
the first three presentations

133
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,279
uh

134
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,640
unless

135
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,680
unless matakoro and steve have joined uh

136
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,800
i think we could start with uh marco

137
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,560
um steve will be joining but i think

138
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,160
you're right let's start with that first

139
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,120
uh the time zone and the time change in

140
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,440
the west the east coast of the us has

141
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,760
thrown some things off marigoro is

142
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,279
having trouble with the registration

143
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,880
that's not accepting his

144
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,600
registration but um oh there's marco

145
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,360

157
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,720
don't see the requests

158
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,160
oh now it's starting okay

159
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,480
yep

160
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,399
there we go

161
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,399
marco you're good to go yeah

162
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,399
okay

163
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,240
i'm trying to share my

164
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,680
okay huh your other screen perhaps

165
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,959
yeah we see your

166
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,959

167
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,680
end of your audio is broken for me let

168
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,839
me

169
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,160
we can see your screen so

170
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,519
i suppose you can stop sharing the

171
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,440
screen and share the other screen if you

172
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,959
want to do that

173
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,279
with the slides

174
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,839
nope you're still there

175
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,959

176
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,519

177
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,959
yes okay

178
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,320
excellent

179
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,199
now let's see the second

180
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,560
or the android do you want to show my

181
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,480
slides if you have

182
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,000
access to them

183
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,600
through the repository maybe that's

184
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,800
easier

185
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,800
hmm

186
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,519
i saw that you requested um

187
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,440
screen sharing but i couldn't really

188
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,120
find how to approve it

189
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,440
so i approved it and um try it again

190
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,920
marco give it a shot you see the thing

191
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,399
that looks like a tv

192
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,480
or a computer monitor

193
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,160

let's see if if chrome behaves

215
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,240
okay let me ask to share my screen

216
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,320
in chrome so maybe that'll help and so

217
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,839

222
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,480

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
fiesta where he's at the international

228
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,040
center for theoretical physics he and

229
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,800
hermano pietro somoli for those of you

230
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,399
that know hermano has done so much work

231
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,480
in latin america

232
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,040
they've got a world's record for a wi-fi

233
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,720
paying from one place to another but

234
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,880
they do a lot of other amazing work and

235
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,559
have a brilliant facility for training

236
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
and we're going to hit them up at some

237
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,480
point in time but marco over to you

238
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,199
okay thank you very much jane and sorry

239
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,160
for the

240
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,559
for the technical glitch so this

241
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,000
presentation was supposed to be the last

242
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,880
one because it was really a call for you

243
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,640
know your ideas

244
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,480
on how to

245
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,799
you know in some way get back to normal

246
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,240
so presentation is together with

247
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,360
kanchana

248
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,000
from aat in in thailand i don't know if

249
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,600
kanchana was able to

250
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,039
to join today

251
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:35,760
but

252
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,360
the idea

253
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,880
came from a meeting we had with with

254
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,640
jane a couple of months ago

255
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,840
and it was

256
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,720
really

257
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,919
about standing touch so in you know the

258
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,960
old days uh you know pre-coded we used

259
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,480
to meet each other

260
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,840
either at conferences or workshops so

261
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,320
you know a couple of times every year i

262
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,720
had a chance to meet jane somewhere

263
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,520
or you know kanchana somewhere or you

264
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,600
know other colleagues from the community

265
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,400
steve or matagora but that's of course

266
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,919
not possible anymore so

267
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,120
we we thought that i mean there is this

268
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,919
lack of you know

269
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,320
exchanging the latest news about

270
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,640
technology and about our research so

271
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,480
this was a call

272
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,080
to discuss how we can you know

273
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,679
in a way coordinate

274
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,640
these meetings so that we can in you

275
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,559
know short time in let's say one you

276
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,880
know one hour slot get the latest

277
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,520
updates about specific technologies or

278
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,559
research or issues that our community is

279
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,120
interested in and

280
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,919
so the idea was to have different venues

281
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:46,640
so

282
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,320
jane kindly cited ictp could be one but

283
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,080
we're all part of you know different

284
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,559
organizations or university or

285
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,840
institutions so hosting people

286
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,360
once a month

287
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,919
and having these short talks 15 to 20

288
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:02,799
minutes

289
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,520
presentations about the latest update

290
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,559
so no you know background information or

291
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,400
you know telling the whole story but

292
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,880
what is the latest news in

293
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,280
specific topics in my case it would be

294
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,360
internet of things or machine learning

295
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,960
on j on the edge

296
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
and then having more time for discussion

297
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,679
questions and answers and experience

298
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,000
sharing so for example you know showing

299
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
the labs showing the latest you know

300
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,480
devices and discussing the latest

301
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,760
research

302
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,160
and of course i mean there's many more

303
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,640
you know topics that can be covered jobs

304
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,880
is number four here

305
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,320
and

306
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,480
example i had some openings for a

307
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,799
postdoc position and i would have loved

308
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,720
to exchange that information

309
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,120
with people in the community

310
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,520
or you know fellowship internships

311
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,600
projects uh you know

312
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,360
a matching interest in

313
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,160
you know looking for funding together

314
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,280
and

315
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,840
we listed here just some of the topics

316
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,360
where we know that you know there has

317
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,440
been a lot going on in the last two

318
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,840
years but we didn't really have the

319
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,280
chance to discuss it with colleagues uh

320
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,520
satellite would be one and i don't know

321
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,159
if steve is here but there is a lot

322
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,320
going on in the field of satellite both

323
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,679
from the technical point of view but

324
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,840
also from the policy point of view

325
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,159
status of connectivity again lots going

326
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,039
on in

327
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,840
the last two years and so having you

328
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,360
know presentation about what is the

329
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,240
current status in different continents

330
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,559
would be very nice iot and machine

331
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,919
learning on the edge that's me again

332
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,159
and i think that's really promising

333
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,280
for our ict 4g community

334
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,520
spectrum sharing and pv weight space

335
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,120
again i know steve is going to give a

336
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,919
presentation but you know learning from

337
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,039
other

338
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,720
colleagues working in this field would

339
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,200
be very nice community networks

340
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,480
uh

341
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,960
a topic which is of interest to eizer

342
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,480
but you know

343
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,320
many of us as well and others i mean

344
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,200
there is

345
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,360
um lots going on in many other fields

346
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,760
so again this is a call

347
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,000
if you're interested if you're you know

348
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,120
willing to give a talk or to host one of

349
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,799
these

350
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,200
talks and meetings you're more than

351
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,679
welcome i don't know how we can

352
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,679
organize it maybe through

353
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,240
some gaia so you can get back to the

354
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
chairs

355
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,840
if you have any proposal any suggestion

356
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,799
and

357
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,400
i really look forward to hearing from

358
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,640
you

359
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,919
about this

360
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,240
idea

361
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,799
back to you jane

362
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,480
and um for those that are new to gaia or

363
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,760
nattonu

364
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,080
this would be just a really interesting

365
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,320
informal way for us to do a mashup and a

366
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
meet up as uh

367
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,799
marco is saying and we've often

368
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,440
we had a great chat with uh kanchana who

369
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
um for those of you that haven't met her

370
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,000
she helped host and do a lot of the work

371
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,840
behind the scenes for the thailand uh

372
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,960
the bangkok ietf a few years ago

373
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,919
she is considered the

374
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,440
uh i don't want to say grandmother the

375
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,440
mother of the internet

376
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,240
in

377
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,640
thailand and in addition to being just a

378
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,600
lovely human she's really done more to

379
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,200
bring the internet to

380
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,520
thailand than just about anybody we know

381
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,919
and we worked closely with her from our

382
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,240
side on to help establish a neutral ixp

383
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,480
as well with randy bush and nsrc and

384
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,760
many others

385
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,000
and it was this typical internet

386
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,799
community collaboration donate well we

387
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,640
got some amazing switches donated with

388
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,760
the help of some of the equipment

389
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,600
manufacturers we work with

390
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,360
um and

391
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,440
she's gotten training with the community

392
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,600
and they really have a world-class ix

393
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,760
right now iso certified

394
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,720
and so

395
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
when you have that collaboration at some

396
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,000
of the heart of what we know to help

397
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,559
build the internet that we have today

398
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,880
and of course continue to build so the

399
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,720
great news is that by having a chat

400
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,880
recently with marco and contana and i

401
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,240
think leandra and i were chatting about

402
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,200
this too

403
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,880
there's a challenge she has in one of

404
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,840
the

405
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,400
poorer parts of bangkok with corrugated

406
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,679
steel roofs

407
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,960
and so when you're trying to send a

408
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,240
signal down

409
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,799
from a high point into um

410
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,200
the area that she's trying to connect

411
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,799
you've got to figure out where to bring

412
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,880
the signal down how to distribute it at

413
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,200
a lower level so that the steel

414
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,280
and the the building materials are not

415
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,600
blocking the signals and so this could

416
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,159
be a situation where if we had a salon

417
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,520
if it were called that or whatever we

418
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,039
want to call it a meet up a community

419
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,360
meet up

420
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,279
in between the gaia meetings and other

421
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,360
that we'd be able to hack that together

422
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,440
i mean many of you who are on the

423
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,960
regional internet registry groups have

424
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,080
also seen

425
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,640
real time uh on their list serves real

426
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,000
time people helping each other saying

427
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,840
hey let's take it offline i've had that

428
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,200
same problem with v4 v6 um so it's that

429
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,279
kind of spirit of how we could hack

430
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,360
things in real time together

431
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,159
um

432
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,919
so there you go

433
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:08,260
um

434
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,600
[Music]

435
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
and yeah you could get back to me and

436
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,240
leandro through the um

437
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,559
and or marco i'm happy to have people to

438
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,480
contact you marco it's up to you

439
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,960
where we could make sure

440
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,039
we set something up that would be more

441
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,919
informal we'd probably do it by um zoom

442
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:26,640
just

443
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,120
to make it easier to get to log in

444
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,840
onto the system

445
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,760
so are there anyone with any thoughts in

446
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,279
the chat

447
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,880
i haven't been monitoring the chat right

448
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,880
now

449
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,919
is that you

450
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,360
yay

451
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,000
bravo all the way from tanzania

452
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,240
um

453
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,080
leandra oops sorry you just saw the cat

454
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,760
this cat is fascinated by the fact that

455
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,679
i have my computer up um

456
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:02,640
anyway

457
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,960
so that was a nice chat from marco who

458
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,640
um we put our heads together a couple

459
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,919
months ago

460
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,679
um to talk about the importance of

461
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,679
staying together uh informally in an

462
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,320
easy breezy way for some of you that

463
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
don't know me um

464
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,880
we often will have these tech chats um

465
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,880
with folks just informally around the

466
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,919
planet

467
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,919
just to see what people are doing to

468
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,760
keep us all together during covet and to

469
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,279
keep innovating

470
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,600
um i think leandro i can go ahead with

471
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,200
matagoro no yeah and we can push through

472
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,679
maybe one quick comment before doing so

473
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,799
uh is that um regarding what marco said

474
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,799
you know the best

475
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,880
the best way to start would be to maybe

476
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,240
organize one

477
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,559
of these meetings and then

478
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,720
people can then

479
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,480
all together see how it works and

480
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,880
and propose replicating experience but i

481
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,640
think the first experience

482
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,440
is

483
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,080
is going to be fundamental to

484
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,799
to show that that it works so if if you

485
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,400
or anyone has uh has an initial topic to

486
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,840
to have such a meeting let's let's try

487
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,640
because for instance uh jane was saying

488
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,400
was talking about like uh

489
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,320
the the challenge kanchana was uh

490
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,000
dealing with and then

491
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,600
that could be also for instance one

492
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,400
example of a of our meeting where we see

493
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,159
together to discuss about that case and

494
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,679
propose solutions

495
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,120
supreme

496
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,720
landry just a question so can you

497
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,840
organize that through

498
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,159
gaya in some way

499
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:40,960
yes

500
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,120
sounds like that i mean beyond the

501
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
meetings during ietf

502
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
yeah

503
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,480
we have a mailing list and

504
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,000
and we can

505
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,080
that's typically called an interim

506
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,159
meeting so we haven't we can have a

507
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,760
meeting without

508
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,799
having

509
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,000
all of us to be registered into the idf

510
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,919
uh and only

511
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,840
through zoom or any other tool that

512
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,760
would be

513
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,679
easier to to set up and less

514
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,880
i mean you can you can invite anyone

515
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,000
and joining the list is simply

516
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,559
simply requesting it and accepting uh

517
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,080
the

518
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,159
membership so i think it's a lightweight

519
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,440
way to

520
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,960
to to discuss on topics which are

521
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,120
hot or uh or promising or interesting

522
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,240
excellent thank you

523
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,760
thank you very much marco for your

524
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,960
presentation and the proposal

525
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,840
so shall we then move to the next unless

526
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,360
it is any other comment from the

527
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,760
audience

528
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,279
we can move to

529
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,279
i don't know material if you are ready

530
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,000
for presenting after dealing with the

531
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,679
struggles of

532
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,720
going through a passport passport and in

533
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,440
the

534
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,720
data tracker

535
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,720
system

536
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,279
do you have some slides to share

537
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,960
i i think i could just um speak i i'll

538
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,640

540
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,480

discussion and um

557
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,600
it was marked in my car currently and i

558
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,080
was trying to login and getting some

559
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,600
difficulties but

560
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,320
thanks for joining jen coffin for the

561
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320

562
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,200
i'm able to log in um and i'm also happy

563
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,960
to

564
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,480
to meet uh marco then right i remember

565
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,039
we met mark in 2013 in in indirusaka he

566
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,000
one of the afnog workshop

567
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,600
and

568
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,159
afterwards we have been working i also

569
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,840
remember when i was struggling

570
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,600
setting up a connection in condor on the

571
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,080
antenna orientation and things like that

572
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,120
and

573
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,600
it was not that much easy marco and i'm

574
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,480
also glad to report that

575
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,880
despite of the struggle we have been

576
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,919
able to be recognized by ieee connecting

577
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,720
the unconnected challenge and we become

578
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,240
the

579
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,440
the second press winner and uh

580
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,080
we are able to be recognized there so

581
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,679
the struggle paid finally

582
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,039
and uh maybe um what i wanted to share

583
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,799
as part of this discussion is that

584
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,840
uh um the unconnected is is not

585
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,480
a one-man show and um

586
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,880
i also came to realize that uh

587
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,360
it require a matter of uh smart

588
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,080
partnership among stakeholders

589
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,480
and uh when i started in 2014 almost uh

590
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,760
seven years back and few months

591
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,320
i thought is is something that is

592
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,200
straightforward and

593
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,320
it's uh um uh the my phd research was

594
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,760
triggered by

595
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,559
just asking a question why is uh

596
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,159
broadband internet so expensive in

597
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,600
tanzania

598
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,320
and uh at that time i i in the

599
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,240
literature there was a lot of factors

600
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,480
that were being reported

601
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,600
including

602
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,520
maybe

603
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,799
spectrum

604
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,919
cost

605
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,399
including

606
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,279
infrastructure and others and actually i

607
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,640
thought maybe

608
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,799
uh there is a missing

609
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,000
affordable technology and um

610
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,600
finally i i

611
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,640
i think was 2013 when our president

612
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,840
signed

613
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
uh the the the president of the nato

614
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,720
republic of tanzania at that time was

615
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,399
the fourth president

616
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,480
when they signed an

617
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,200
a memorandum of understanding microsoft

618
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,760
on undertaking the

619
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,600
the tv white space in in urban tanzania

620
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,120
and at that time they were planning to

621
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,559
connect few

622
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,559
higher ending institutions

623
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,279
and

624
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,880
they tied up

625
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,919
device

626
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,360
provision to

627
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,760
as maybe as part of their own

628
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,000
to hire an institution and also access

629
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,760
to microsoft uh software z products

630
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,360
and uh uh uh uh in twitter i was also

631
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,120
a part of the coordinator of the

632
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,480
microsoft innovation center the

633
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,200
universal doma so it was quite

634
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,000
quite easy for me to jump in and try to

635
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,240
work

636
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,159
working with them

637
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,960
was somewhat good but uh as you might be

638
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,000
aware that most most commercial

639
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,919
organizations

640
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,240
normal restrict

641
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,640
new entry especially when new person is

642
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,640
coming to the team

643
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,720
so it was not that much easier for me to

644
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,200
join and um

645
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,760
uh and because there was also a skill

646
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,360
gap because uh

647
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,279
my first degree is on computer science

648
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,760
and my second degree in computer science

649
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,679
and i was jumping to the phd in

650
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,200
telecommunication engineering so i

651
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,120
decided to join

652
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,960
the indian institute of technology

653
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,600
mumbai for six month fellowship

654
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,679
and once i came back because the team

655
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,240
realized that i had the right skills

656
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,000
because while at india i was

657
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,320
participating on the tv osw deployment

658
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,640
in india and we are connecting some of

659
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,919
the school and rural in india so almost

660
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,080
six six months and once i come back the

661
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
team realized that i was having the

662
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
right skills so they also came back to

663
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,279
me and we started a kind of

664
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,159
of partnership and working together a

665
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,679
special access to some of the devices

666
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,279
however

667
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,519
in 2017

668
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,760
we had an online meeting with malcolm

669
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,480
and

670
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,679
elman from ictp ital

671
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,840
and we decided that we can set up

672
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,000
at that time i think malcolm proposed

673
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,279
something like

674
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,279
maybe community network but this was a

675
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,279
new term and um

676
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,840
in tanzania it was

677
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,000
actually a new term to me personal and

678
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,679
actual in uh

679
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,360
in the ground

680
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,679
and when we submitted to internet

681
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,919
society through the beyond the net

682
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,039
funding

683
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,600
we were able to secure funding from the

684
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,279
internet society

685
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,159
and afterwards we the universal domain

686
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,880
also procured some of the equipment

687
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,200
as part of my research and we started

688
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,840
the deployment in condor and finally we

689
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,239
were able to set up a rink

690
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,359
however

691
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,359
the cost for bandwidth was so expensive

692
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,599
because for mbps

693
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,879
we were paid around we are paying around

694
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,800
1000 usd

695
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,079
per month

696
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,399
and uh on top of that we were also

697
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,320
paying the corrocation fee which was

698
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,239
around um

699
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,480
it was around

700
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,399
400

701
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,800
400 usd because it was um

702
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,079
[Music]

703
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,000
seven seven seven hundred thousand

704
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,399
tanzania shootings so around maximum

705
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,199
approximately to 400

706
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,760
usd so you can imagine

707
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,359
uh euro

708
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,520
a rural community

709
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,239
paying per month almost

710
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,119
1

711
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,480
400

712
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,719
just for foreign bps it was somewhat

713
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,560
very expensive

714
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,160
for sustainability

715
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,760
but uh for for because our our target

716
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,440
was to see

717
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,240
how the technology and the community

718
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,240
engagement can complement and address

719
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,400
the victory rights

720
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,560
afterwards uh

721
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,680
the universal dodoma secured

722
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,400
the the academic authorization letter

723
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,119
from the local from the local regulator

724
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,680
and we were able to get

725
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,079
the two-year academic license with the

726
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,440
local regret

727
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,800
so after two years uh expired

728
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,760
then we were adapted by the regret that

729
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,079
we have to switch off the devices

730
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,920
and at that time

731
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,839
we were also hosting the fourth summit

732
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,160
in africa the first summit on community

733
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,000
network in africa

734
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,640
and we tried to record to request at

735
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,160
least two weeks

736
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,880
the devices to be on and uh

737
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,760
because as part of the the summit we

738
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,720
also had the saitvist condor

739
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,839
so

740
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,599
uh the the ministry and the rock uh the

741
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,880
national

742
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,240
regret uh

743
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,440
they were able to allow to a two weeks

744
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,000
permission to switch on their devices

745
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,480
and after the submit then we were

746
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,560
instructed to switch off

747
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,760
the devices so since 2009

748
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,920
uh devices are there in sight but they

749
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,599
are off because

750
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,320
the regretta said

751
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,760
tv white space have not yet got

752
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,720
the regressions so we are not allowed to

753
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,599
use the devices up to the moment

754
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,920
we have struggled to to bring the

755
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,480
government on board for a discussion

756
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,119
and a very recent i think was in may

757
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,920
one of the youth in condor

758
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,720
who was benefiting the service internet

759
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,280
service wrote an open letter to the

760
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,400
permanent

761
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,359
the

762
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,440
prime minister

763
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,920
it actually was a whatsapp message that

764
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,640
was uh broadcasted through various

765
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,680
channels

766
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,599
i think that the message was wrote in

767
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,480
the midnight and uh

768
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,720
good luck in the morning

769
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,720
at 8 00 a.m

770
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,680
uh the rent was on on the on the desk of

771
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,280
the prime minister and the prime

772
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,560
minister

773
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,119
afforded the message to the mini to the

774
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,240
minister cabinet to the cabinets and um

775
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,400
now people are the the the ministers

776
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,839
were now

777
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,920
running here and there to find

778
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,760
why the devices are off

779
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,760
who are behind it

780
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,920
and it was really at that time i

781
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,240
remember it was on may and it was really

782
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,160
a headache for me because

783
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,800
you can imagine the minister phoning you

784
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,640
that you we need to meet the permanent

785
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,960
sectors are calling you that matagoro

786
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,960
what is happening the vice chancellor is

787
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,040
coding so it was really

788
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,119
very hectic and actually i was not even

789
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,920
aware what was going on

790
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,720
and

791
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,920
and

792
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,599
finally i was also able to get the

793
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,640
access to the message and phoned

794
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,880
the the guy who wrote that message it

795
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,800
was actually

796
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,480
just sending out a message that we've

797
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,040
been defeated from the service and photo

798
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,800
entered the service is off because of

799
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,200
the regressions so they were asking if

800
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,520
the prime minister can intervene and

801
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,480
switch on the devices

802
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,960
so that message

803
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,160
brought

804
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,599
a new chapter actual because

805
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,720
now the ministry of communication and

806
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,800
information technology

807
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,640
struggled to bring on board all the

808
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,880
stakeholders that were engaged the

809
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,839
greater the university the community

810
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,599
networks

811
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,880
uh

812
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,880
though although in the meeting it was

813
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,119
not that much easier because everyone

814
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,480
was complaining

815
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,839
that

816
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,599
if if this

817
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,280
work were completed

818
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,160
why devices are still there in the field

819
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,880
and

820
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,640
if community network

821
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,560
are in need of using the approach

822
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,440
they also record the advice that they

823
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,800
have to follow

824
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,280
the current procedure

825
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,760
at the moment if a community network

826
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,240
wants to operate in tanzania

827
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,119
you have to register a private company

828
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,640
in the business registration

829
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,119
organization called breda

830
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,400
and afterwards you have to using the the

831
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,560
the registered limited company or

832
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,000
private company

833
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,760
you have to apply for the for the

834
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,040
license

835
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,240
uh

836
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,520
actually for the

837
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,880
there are three

838
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,560
are almost four

839
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,960
market segmentation for the races you

840
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,880
can now pray for the district level you

841
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,320
can go for them

842
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,480
regional you can go to the national

843
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,800
level or international there are four

844
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,160
market segments for the license

845
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,599
so after that uh discussion you can

846
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,720
imagine

847
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,000
almost seven years doing the same

848
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,280
initiative

849
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,680
but the regulator was not ready to

850
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,400
listen what we are trying to propose

851
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,319
until the message was received to the

852
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,280
prime minister so afterwards it's when

853
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,440
the regretta came with the blaming that

854
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,800
we are trying to

855
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,880
you know report them and something like

856
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,680
that

857
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,720
but uh finally they are able to give us

858
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,480
the option that uh

859
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,560
if we if you want to use the

860
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,839
community-based kind of uh

861
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:26,000
approach then the community needs to

862
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,560
register a limited company to the

863
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,160
business registration

864
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,839
organization

865
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,079
business resolution license organization

866
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,560
and then afterwards they have to apply

867
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,680
for the license and then the procedure

868
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,079
can can go on because they are saying

869
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,480
for them to assess whether they give you

870
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,960
a license they they assess two things

871
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,880
they assess the financial

872
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,000
aspects

873
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,720
and also the technical aspects so if you

874
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,240
go as a not-for-profit organization

875
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,720
then it is hard for them to assess

876
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,640
financial because you have already said

877
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,119
you are not for profit

878
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,079
so afterwards we we struggled then how

879
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,240
do we make it because

880
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,800
if you want to make as a as a limited

881
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,119
company that means you have to go

882
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,359
through the traditional approach with

883
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,160
where

884
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,880
most of commercial sp are doing

885
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,280
and and in that way you also get

886
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,359
subjected to a lot of tax that you have

887
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,040
to pay

888
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,839
uh

889
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,000
although very recently uh the gov the

890
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,359
minister also

891
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,200
uh sent out

892
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,480
the public comment on regression and

893
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,119
enacting some of the regressions and we

894
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,040
also try to give out our our

895
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,359
recommendation and input one of the

896
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,520
critical suggestions that we gave out is

897
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,720
that

898
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,599
yes we we appreciate uh the initiative

899
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,920
of going through the commercial approach

900
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,200
that is being

901
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,000
directed by the by the regulator but we

902
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,560
are requesting a trust for the community

903
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,040
for organization or isp owned by

904
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,160
cooperative

905
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,720
admit at least to be exempted

906
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,960
from paying the

907
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,520
universal access fund because you know

908
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,760
if you are if we are commercial sp then

909
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,920
you also have to contribute to the

910
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,520
universal communication service basket

911
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,680
which is also another another another

912
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,920
cost on top of that so we are still on

913
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,440
that discussion

914
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,079
but uh what i appreciate is that uh

915
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,440
at least we are now in a way to know

916
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,599
what could be the best approach for

917
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,440
community network to operate

918
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,640
that means

919
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,880
we we support them to establish a

920
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,480
community network

921
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,440
and the community network

922
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,920
the the registered cooperatives

923
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,040
then register a limited campaign and

924
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,040
afterwards the limited company on behalf

925
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,480
of the cooperatives

926
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,319
apply for their license after the

927
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,760
license then

928
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,680
after the limited company got the

929
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,240
license then they could apply and they

930
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,119
can they can up uh they can operate in

931
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,119
the district level and uh at the

932
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,560
disclaimer i think is something that we

933
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,240
can afford because the license fee is

934
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,240
around

935
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,960
250 usd and the registration fee is 50

936
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,720
50 usd so making a total of 300 usd

937
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,440
getting the license as a district trade

938
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,520
but if you go for the notch of the

939
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,800
original it got to 1500

940
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,720
and if you add up the lessons the

941
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,920
russian fee

942
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,400
the cost to go high if you go to the

943
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,079
nationals it's around 10 000 usd for the

944
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,839
license fee and you must have to pay for

945
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:34,640
uh

946
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,400
registration fee so

947
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,240
we may not be able to go for the

948
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,960
national um because

949
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,119
we we started with only

950
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,760
five community networks so we opted

951
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,000
that's better for these five communities

952
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,280
to go for

953
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,280
for the district level because we can at

954
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,800
least pay 1 100 and five hundred one one

955
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,480
hundred and five thousand

956
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,119
uh one one thousand and five hundred usd

957
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:00,400
uh for three

958
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,240
all for this five

959
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,440
uh community network and afterwards

960
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,480
once we

961
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,760
we perform

962
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,800
then we can now uh go to maybe a

963
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,119
national level if we need we see is

964
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,839
something that is is sustainable and on

965
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,720
top of the sustainability uh we are now

966
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,800
proposing a sustainable business model

967
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,480
with 80 parameter

968
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,359
where we understand that partnership is

969
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,400
key so we have private public

970
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,839
partnership plus people and the 50

971
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,160
parameter we also adding up on

972
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,319
income generating activity that uh

973
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,920
because you know commercial asp are

974
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,920
running away from rural community

975
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,800
because

976
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,960
they may not be afforded to pay for the

977
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,480
internet and other communication

978
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,520
services so for now we are now trying to

979
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,480
see how we can empower economical

980
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,520
these rural people especially by

981
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,359
engaging them to some of the income

982
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,440
generating activities because after for

983
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,359
example things like portrait

984
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:00,960
poetry farming

985
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,319
and

986
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,720
sunflower cultivations

987
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,599
and other similar

988
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,520
income generating activities

989
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,119
relevant to specific area and the sixth

990
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,440
parameter we're also adding up on the

991
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,520
capacity building because some of the

992
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,000
community members if you ask them they

993
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,599
say we cannot have a smartphone because

994
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,000
we don't even know how to use it so that

995
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,640
means there is an issue of our of our of

996
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,359
our digital retreats and the the seventh

997
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,760
one is on the initial protocol content

998
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,200
so we are trying to

999
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,640
you know uh

1000
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,480
if you try to assess the current

1001
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,880
telecommunication ecosystem it's like

1002
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,200
very fragmented in term of bringing

1003
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,040
together all those eight seven

1004
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,119
parameters so what we are trying to do

1005
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,640
is to to rebuild uh the current uh

1006
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,960
telecommunication ecosystem using the

1007
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,359
community network cooperative as a way

1008
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,400
to to bridge the the victories i was

1009
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,440
even trying to think you can imagine

1010
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,960
uh maybe

1011
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,680
if if if a condition for one to own a

1012
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,079
sim card was first you go through

1013
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,800
cooperative and afterwards

1014
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,680
you you you you get a sim card

1015
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,359
and uh

1016
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:16,480
because if you go through the

1017
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,359
cooperative that means you have to pay

1018
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,920
you have to buy shares and also you have

1019
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,920
to pay the entry fee

1020
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,240
and afterwards you have to use the

1021
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,280
service

1022
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,640
so i can imagine uh if cooperative

1023
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,920
approach were

1024
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,280
were to be adopted by the existing

1025
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,400
commercial mobile network operators

1026
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,040
then i understand even the the issue of

1027
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,119
usage gap which we are currently saying

1028
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,119
that uh for example in tanzania the

1029
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,119
usage gap is is very high you find

1030
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,200
people are living with that within the

1031
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,680
coverage gap within the the

1032
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,920
infrastructure coverage but they are not

1033
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,720
using the services because you find all

1034
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,119
these parameters are fragmented

1035
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,000
so

1036
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,119
we we are trying to push this and

1037
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,160
maybe

1038
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,200
what is our wrong

1039
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,319
vision

1040
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,200
is probable we might reach a point where

1041
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,240
we have

1042
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,240
a big and strong

1043
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,119
internet service provider which is owned

1044
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,359
by cooperatives in tanzania because our

1045
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,520
target is to connect at least

1046
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,160
20 million users in 10 years to come so

1047
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,599
that's

1048
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,480
what i thought i could share and

1049
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,800
maybe who does open up for discussion

1050
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,119
thank you

1051
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:39,839
does anyone have any questions

1052
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,160
you're describing something we've seen

1053
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,720
in many countries matagoro with

1054
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,040
the difficulty that is imposed through

1055
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,359
the old system of licensing and spectrum

1056
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,520
allocation and assignment

1057
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,119
and just

1058
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,520
small business right because if you have

1059
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,119
to register and be authorized as a

1060
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:00,960
business and then

1061
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,960
pay all of the different fees i didn't

1062
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,480
realize you had that many layers of

1063
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,880
licensing fees because that's quite a

1064
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,119
lot um

1065
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,880
and you're just starting up right you're

1066
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,599
you're you're a startup and so it's a

1067
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,599
non-profit startup and i think for those

1068
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:16,640
on the

1069
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,079
the

1070
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,200
call here um when we say non-profit

1071
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,040
startup we don't mean that it's not a

1072
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,720
business-like entity because i know

1073
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,119
macro quite well it's very business-like

1074
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,200
but you're you're trying to get started

1075
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,760
and if part of it is the the hampered by

1076
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,400
the licensing the fees but i think

1077
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,520
you're seeing a change with the

1078
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,440
regulator am i right and the ministry it

1079
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,520
took the prime minister to get them to

1080
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,839
change the spectrum allocation and other

1081
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:45,799
things yes is that right

1082
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,079
um i have a question um

1083
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,200
um

1084
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,599
i was taking notes of your of your talk

1085
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,200
and um yeah as jane said um

1086
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,680
it's familiar unfortunately

1087
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,280
but um

1088
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,960
how about today i mean

1089
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,800
how do you think um

1090
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,040
the the process you went through

1091
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,200
would help any other

1092
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,160
initiative in the country to have a

1093
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,440
better start or to at least learn from

1094
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,760
your

1095
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,319
from your from your experience or even

1096
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,559
take advantage of the path you opened

1097
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,960
for them

1098
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,440
yeah actually uh what we are you you

1099
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,119
know uh then wrote happened uh uh

1100
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,559
i actually just

1101
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,920
jumped in um to advocate for community

1102
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,240
network you can imagine

1103
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,440
uh the concept started to to to ring in

1104
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,800
my mind

1105
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,200
i think was 2016 2017 but actually

1106
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,079
i started rural connectivity

1107
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,520
since 2014. so almost seven years

1108
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,119
and um

1109
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,440
i i thought it's something just this is

1110
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,119
simple you know

1111
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,079
but i i i came to realize that it's very

1112
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:07,839
complex and uh

1113
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,480
if one is not clever you can just turn

1114
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,960
up right becoming like as an activist

1115
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,920
you know

1116
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,119
and um

1117
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,040
an endless activity because you if

1118
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,680
you're also activating uh trying to to

1119
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,680
advocate for something

1120
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,280
you also try to

1121
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,680
to to accommodate the existing

1122
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,680
regulatory frameworks

1123
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,960
so

1124
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,920
we pushed we pushed for almost

1125
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,960
four to five years and we realized that

1126
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,920
in this way it would happen

1127
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,720
so um

1128
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,839
what we have seen is that uh

1129
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,559
if we push and have

1130
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,079
registered these

1131
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,559
because we also managed to have after

1132
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:53,040
after having that approach

1133
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,240
there are some other few

1134
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,359
wall street isp that have already

1135
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:00,960
approached that for example we had a

1136
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,400
discussion with uh

1137
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,880
ben robert from liquidity telcom where

1138
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,000
he said

1139
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,880
liquid telcom is ready to support

1140
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,599
uh

1141
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,319
uh maybe rural based on not-for-profit

1142
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,440
isp

1143
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,599
but having the license

1144
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,760
the the rigor license from the from the

1145
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,880
local regulator so we have seen that uh

1146
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,559
if we have if we now have the license

1147
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,319
in the district level

1148
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:29,520
we we have other commercial

1149
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,720
isp

1150
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,240
but my similar mindset that can support

1151
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,559
the initiative rather than just trying

1152
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,480
to push something that

1153
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,480
we never got through

1154
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,079
so i i see that uh what now is uh is a

1155
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,920
way forward for me

1156
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,720
is uh because i have already directed my

1157
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,240
my rego team i have a very intelligent

1158
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,440
uh intelligent uh regal expert miss

1159
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,240
elizabeth james who is leading our team

1160
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,319
as the director of regular services and

1161
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,319
partnership so they have already

1162
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,800
initiated the process of

1163
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,760
registering these uh five

1164
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,280
uh organized

1165
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,400
limited

1166
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,920
companies and then

1167
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,000
they will take care of the

1168
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,240
of applying the license on behalf of

1169
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,040
these

1170
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,119
of these cooperatives that have already

1171
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:21,520
established and afterwards

1172
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,079
after getting that license then

1173
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:25,280
uh

1174
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,079
isp like liquid terkom who are

1175
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,440
supporting

1176
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,640
uh isp in term of warfare bandwidth

1177
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,680
sharing

1178
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,520
then they are ready to work with us

1179
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,079
because we are we can even get

1180
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,119
uh the bandwidth reaching to all these

1181
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,960
districts that we we have we have

1182
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,599
initiated so to me i see that uh it is

1183
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,079
opening up some doors and we have

1184
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:50,800
already identified some of the

1185
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,200
similar minded uh isp who can can tap on

1186
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,200
the advantage of the wall sale prices

1187
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,079
that they have so that we can sell the

1188
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,720
price that is affordable with our

1189
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,559
community in these

1190
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,079
five established

1191
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,040
cooperatives thank you

1192
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,440
thank you so much

1193
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,119
i wonder if there is any other question

1194
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,839
from the audience

1195
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,079
i see the comments

1196
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:22,480
in parallel of the discussion

1197
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,800
jane was talking about

1198
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,960
things related you to what you might

1199
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,880
already representing

1200
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,400
so you might take a look later

1201
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,598
and also marco

1202
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,480
their hands up i did want to just um ask

1203
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,319
one quick question myself sorry i didn't

1204
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,240
hop into the queue properly

1205
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,520
um

1206
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,640
matagoro

1207
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,720
is the is the ministry and or the

1208
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,960
regulator now looking at tv white space

1209
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,880
as viable and other

1210
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,680
different innovative uses of spectrum

1211
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,319
for future connectivity because

1212
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,520
this won't go away and obviously with

1213
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,359
kevin showing everybody that everybody

1214
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:06,960
needs to be connected even more than

1215
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,440
normal um it's been the best advertising

1216
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,280
i think for a lot of what we all do

1217
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,720
in a weird way

1218
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,359
um are they rethinking um spectrum

1219
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,760
allocation and assignment not everything

1220
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,200
i know some people get very excited when

1221
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,920
we talk about spectrum change but what

1222
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,680
are you seeing and just in general

1223
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,800
because it would be interesting to hear

1224
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,880
that too

1225
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,400
yeah uh

1226
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,079
the good thing is that

1227
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,880
you know jane um

1228
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,079
i think

1229
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,520
sometimes noises help you know

1230
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,040
because uh

1231
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,000
uh

1232
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,079
as because of the noises that i've been

1233
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,599
doing uh

1234
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,200
even very recently the ministry secured

1235
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,760
i think was uh ozit a grants or run from

1236
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,119
the world bank

1237
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,599
on on connectivity and um

1238
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,200
one of the solutions they are looking

1239
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,200
forward was

1240
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,920
a broadband overpowering and also

1241
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,280
the tv white space technology so even

1242
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,640
the minister um um the the the person in

1243
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,720
charge from the ministry on

1244
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,960
on that on that project also approached

1245
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,319
me and uh

1246
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:15,359
i was part of developing like

1247
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,440
something that we could try to take

1248
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,640
advantage of the tv white space so i i

1249
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,799
see things happening but uh

1250
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,559
there are still a few engineers who are

1251
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:25,920
trying to

1252
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,520
give

1253
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,599
informations which are not correct like

1254
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:33,280
um maybe some one of them

1255
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,520
the point that i had when i had a

1256
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,200
conversation with the minister is that

1257
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,160
uh

1258
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,640
there was an ad device that tv white

1259
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,799
space should be pended

1260
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:46,000
until wrc 2023

1261
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,599
to decide on the on the direction

1262
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,720
and uh one of the discussion in uh

1263
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,839
is ctu i was asking one of the guy from

1264
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:57,760
itu was

1265
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,520
responsible on the spectrum and

1266
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,480
standardization and he said itu does not

1267
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,119
have mandates on the rocco spectrum

1268
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,480
management so

1269
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,640
but i think they are also praying like

1270
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,319
deranged techniques and something like

1271
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:11,119
that

1272
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,359
but uh we we are we are we are happy

1273
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:14,640
that uh

1274
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,000
the president has as as the the current

1275
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,240
president has mentioned that uh

1276
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,079
they they need to increase broadband

1277
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,720
penetration from uh fought three percent

1278
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,240
to eighty percent

1279
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,680
so that means

1280
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,400
uh they they have to adopt uh different

1281
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,040
different technology and

1282
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,000
one something that i also noted that uh

1283
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,680
there was also confusion within the

1284
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,920
regulator because they thought

1285
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,480
tv workspace is going to replace other

1286
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,680
technology but uh in the discussion i

1287
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,880
mentioned that

1288
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,680
we are not advocating tv workspaces as a

1289
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,160
technology to replace others but we just

1290
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,079
want to have multiple

1291
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:57,440
options if one goes to wi-fi it's okay

1292
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,839
if one goes to five by c okay this one

1293
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:02,160
goes to tv was but we we are not

1294
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,160
mentioning that tv workspace is going to

1295
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,000
replace more but mobile broadband

1296
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,240
because the regulator is mentioning

1297
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,640
there was a cine engineer saying that um

1298
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,480
a mobile broadband is going to to to

1299
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,960
to to be able to address all the digital

1300
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,200
divide but we are saying that uh we are

1301
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,520
not mentioning tv westfalls as a

1302
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,000
replacement of mulberry broadband but we

1303
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
just want to have tv workspace as a

1304
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,839
complementary solution

1305
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,640
maybe to to have more options because

1306
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,640
you may reach a point where

1307
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,280
you you have only tv espresso as an

1308
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,240
option to establish that ring

1309
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,480
so afterwards they think we have seen

1310
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,960
that uh and something that also noted

1311
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,760
that most of the guys with the regretta

1312
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,799
started with uh with their first job

1313
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,040
with the mobile network operators

1314
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,280
afterwards they shifted to the regret so

1315
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,760
you find the owner understand that

1316
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,480
mobile is everything

1317
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,119
thank you jay

1318
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,400
thank you marco

1319
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,119
hey thank you motorola i have a question

1320
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,760
so what about this spectrum measurement

1321
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,040
remember

1322
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,119
in at the beginning of this project i

1323
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,559
think you carried out

1324
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,480
these spectral measurements to show how

1325
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,040
much spectrum was available for tv white

1326
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,400
space

1327
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,000
has that been useful

1328
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,839
to you know start the discussion with

1329
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,400
the regulator

1330
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,559
yeah yeah yeah it was useful because you

1331
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,559
know we also managed to publish a paper

1332
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:35,359
in springer and i have seen it is one of

1333
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:36,720
the very

1334
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,440
i downloaded paper in in spring so it

1335
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,920
may be you may find even the same people

1336
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,920
who are against the wheat are the one

1337
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,760
making use of it so

1338
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,960
at least we have scientific

1339
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,559
and academic

1340
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:51,359
uh

1341
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,520
evidence showing that uh

1342
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,000
the spectrum is undiutraced

1343
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,559
and in that way in most cases in most of

1344
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:00,400
the presentation we are doing

1345
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,720
we also show that this is the situation

1346
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,680
and uh

1347
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,240
it always isn't the discussion so i

1348
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,160
think it was very helpful

1349
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,880
and we are trying to push for that uh

1350
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,319
that uh

1351
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:14,480
the there is a huge gender utilization

1352
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,559
of the resources and uh we should not

1353
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,359
wait four years or three years until wrc

1354
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:20,640
2003

1355
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,480
while people are not connected in rural

1356
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,720
you can imagine for example

1357
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,359
if you see for school connectivity

1358
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,640
you find around like 32 percent of

1359
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,880
secondary schools are only connected and

1360
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,559
if you go to the primary school it's

1361
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:38,240
only 39 almost 40 percent have

1362
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,760
connectivity so

1363
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,760
that means we need to have this kind of

1364
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,240
complement but i'm happy that uh

1365
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,559
they they are now pushing that material

1366
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:49,280
okay now also i apply again for for the

1367
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,359
for the academic reasons you get up you

1368
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:54,400
know but i think things are opening up

1369
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,319
it's quite different when i started

1370
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:59,319
things

1371
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,200
we also have kanchana who can come in

1372
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,640
via voice

1373
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,720
um and kachana you've you've probably

1374
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,319
seen some of the similar issues that

1375
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,480
matagoro is seeing with respect to

1376
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,359
spectrum and the mentality or sort of

1377
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,200
the need to educate regulators quite

1378
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,520
frankly in ministries because matagord

1379
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,319
your point about waiting until 2023 for

1380
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:25,599
the world radio conference uh no and and

1381
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,359
that's such a political conference it'll

1382
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,280
be a leo based conference they'll be

1383
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,480
talking about

1384
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,079
low earth orbiting satellites and

1385
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:34,480
orbital slots and you know it'll be

1386
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,640
quite a show and so an important meeting

1387
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,319
of course greedy

1388
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,559
but that will be crazy and content we're

1389
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,880
gonna

1390
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,400
yes uh hello everybody i'm sorry i was

1391
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,280
late

1392
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,640
uh

1393
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,160
yeah uh

1394
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,200
i think

1395
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,480
my experience and

1396
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,960
your experience is not so much different

1397
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,319
but uh what i tried to do was

1398
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:04,559
uh i tried my best to avoid having to

1399
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:06,799
deal with regulator

1400
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:08,720
so i always

1401
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,599
try to use the wi-fi

1402
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:12,640
and

1403
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:16,160
we we were we were given an opportunity

1404
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,720
to test tv white space

1405
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,160
and

1406
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,839
we found that

1407
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:22,559
the

1408
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,760
technology was okay but

1409
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,559
the problem was the equipment the vendor

1410
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,920
uh

1411
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,720
in this technology are not ready to to

1412
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,000
support us

1413
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,799
so

1414
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:36,160
i think

1415
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,839
for thailand tv white space is kind of

1416
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:43,040
you know put on the shelf

1417
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:44,799
from the regulator point of view and

1418
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:47,040
from our point of view as well

1419
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,880
so uh

1420
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,359
from that i experienced

1421
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,920
what happened is our community network

1422
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,640
with our community network we also try

1423
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,760
to

1424
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,440
work in the area where you don't have

1425
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,440
you don't have connective

1426
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,640
connectivity and provider and what

1427
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,039
happened is that after a few years the

1428
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:11,599
providers started to come in

1429
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:13,440
you know they realized that

1430
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,640
there's

1431
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,319
some demand for

1432
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,760
their services

1433
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,480
and then they started to feel that we

1434
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,319
were

1435
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:25,280
we were that competitor so

1436
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,160
uh things are starting to get

1437
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,760
you know get

1438
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,920
difficult between us and

1439
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,400
our provider themselves and

1440
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,680
but what happened is uh during project

1441
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,640
with the pandemic

1442
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,039
you have demand for

1443
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:44,400
online

1444
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,880
classrooms so

1445
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,680
online learning so we took this

1446
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:53,680
opportunity to deal with the bangkok uh

1447
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,839
slum area

1448
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:58,400
so this is not a

1449
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,520
rural

1450
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,079
community network but

1451
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:05,440
in the city community network so we

1452
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,359
immediately

1453
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,920
take this opportunity to

1454
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,760
build a community

1455
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,200
in bangkok area and

1456
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,920
we have already we spent about three

1457
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,680
months on this project already and uh

1458
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:25,520
it's we have very good responses and

1459
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,480
the

1460
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,880
people in the in the community really

1461
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,200
appreciate our help

1462
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,480
so we

1463
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,280
uh

1464
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,200
you know with this opportunity you can

1465
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,960
talk to regulators

1466
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,039
and they are nice at the moment because

1467
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,400
they want to see things moving so

1468
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,400
everyone came to

1469
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,319
to be our friend now

1470
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:49,359
so i i suggest that you try

1471
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:50,880
uh

1472
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,119
not

1473
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,440
not fighting with regulator or

1474
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,559
government

1475
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,799
try to work around

1476
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,680
and whenever there's opportunity arise

1477
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,760
then you can

1478
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,480
get that understanding

1479
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,480
this is my approach and i think i'm i i

1480
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,760
it's been working so far in my country

1481
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,359
yeah

1482
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,359
so

1483
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:19,839
thank you

1484
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,200
what are you finding from the technical

1485
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,280
perspective with respect to you've got

1486
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,880
unlicensed spectrum

1487
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,319
and you're lucky because in some

1488
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:34,079
countries they're still not unlicensing

1489
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,440
the wi-fi

1490
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,680
um

1491
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:38,960
we use

1492
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,760
whatever they allow us you know

1493
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,799
they don't

1494
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:43,920
uh

1495
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,839
you know we try to use

1496
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:48,480
equipment of you know from whatever is

1497
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,520
available in the market we don't want to

1498
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,960
have problem

1499
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,760
with them so

1500
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,880
it's difficult to set up but

1501
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,680
yet

1502
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,359
we

1503
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,119
we managed

1504
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:05,599
so i i think that

1505
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:09,039
because we try our best not to confront

1506
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:12,319
with them with the regulator or not to

1507
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:14,319
go against them because

1508
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,000
that would be

1509
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,559
uh would put yourself in a more

1510
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:21,760
difficult position

1511
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,799
you know

1512
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:25,599
they already feel that you are not

1513
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:26,960
one of them

1514
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,240
and if you as you start to do something

1515
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,319
that is out of their

1516
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:33,200
uh

1517
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,240
you know

1518
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,280
out of

1519
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,160
uh what they have to allow you to do

1520
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,359
then you'll be in trouble and they'll

1521
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:44,160
you know you cannot move from that

1522
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,520
so from my experience is to try your

1523
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,319
best

1524
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:52,480
um you know there's so many uh many uh

1525
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,160
technical solutions that you can adopt

1526
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,599
and work

1527
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:58,400
and

1528
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:02,000
try to be uh try to follow whatever they

1529
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,359
allow you to

1530
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:04,480
and

1531
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,680
talk to them

1532
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,280
and convince them

1533
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,920
and then they will they once they see

1534
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:13,280
you what you are doing and they can

1535
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,480
you know they

1536
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,640
have witnessed

1537
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,839
your activity then i think

1538
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:23,038
they begin to listen

1539
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:27,680
so that's my approach and i think it may

1540
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,520
it should work

1541
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:33,000
in many countries

1542
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,160
thank you

1543
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,280
that kantana and i was about to type

1544
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,520
this chat but i'll say this out loud is

1545
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,200
that um you're very lucky that you're

1546
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,960
able to use that

1547
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,119
unlicensed spectrum for jabera and

1548
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:48,720
others who are looking at innovative use

1549
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,520
of tv white space or cprs or other

1550
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,599
you run up against the old ways of

1551
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,599
working and it's not just the old ways

1552
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:58,079
of working that are complicated it's the

1553
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:00,079
um the fact that certain areas that

1554
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:02,000
don't have a certain income levels or

1555
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,920
are very far away

1556
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,079
rural remote

1557
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:07,599
many mobile operators and this is where

1558
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:09,119
we want to be

1559
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:11,119
partners with mobile operators because

1560
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:12,559
for some of them they don't get a return

1561
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:15,359
on investment in communities of 5000 and

1562
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:17,520
under the roi isn't there so this is the

1563
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:18,880
business case

1564
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,319
and we've talked to many and we've

1565
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:22,000
worked we've talked to gsma and some

1566
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,400
others we've got to find a way to allow

1567
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,240
the smaller networks in of course as we

1568
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,799
all know the internet is made up of many

1569
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:30,400
different types of networks the network

1570
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,920
of networks and so

1571
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,400
to not allow motivation in is kind of

1572
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,440
crazy

1573
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,599
and so we run into these you can't get

1574
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,960
through this bottleneck because it's

1575
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,400
regulatory and you can't get through

1576
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,559
this bottleneck because you have very

1577
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,559
strong lobbying um

1578
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:45,599
arms

1579
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:47,440
and i'm not saying that there's got to

1580
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,880
be a way as you're saying kanchana

1581
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,119
wherever you are to

1582
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:53,200
get through those bottoms i think uh

1583
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,079
what what you need to do is to have a

1584
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:59,599
working solution that can convince them

1585
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:02,319
so you need to start somewhere

1586
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:03,280
and

1587
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,880
in order to do that

1588
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,520
uh try to do your best

1589
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,240
within the the whatever they have given

1590
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:10,960
you

1591
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,799
so once you start

1592
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:15,520
to have a solution then they could see

1593
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,560
something working then you can start you

1594
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,279
know convincing them and try to talk to

1595
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:23,520
to teleport and get them to work with

1596
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,880
you

1597
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,560
you have to start

1598
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,080
this is

1599
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,279
my my philosophy it's not

1600
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,198
because i was

1601
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:35,679
like any of you because i used to fight

1602
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,799
as well and i found that it was

1603
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:40,560
more difficult to

1604
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,000
to argue without anything in your hand

1605
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,920
but once you have something in your hand

1606
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,440
then it's easier to talk to them

1607
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,238
is mentioning very true that um

1608
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:58,880
uh you you you need to have a working

1609
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,640
solution and um

1610
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,600
yeah even then you you you can imagine

1611
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,880
um

1612
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,198
we we have been able to penetrate to

1613
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:09,279
this level because we was having tv

1614
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:11,759
workspace offering solutions offering

1615
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:13,439
working solutions

1616
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:17,120
and uh maybe something did you have a tv

1617
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,799
white space that's actually operating

1618
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:23,679
did you yes yes we we we because you

1619
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:27,359
know uh i i wear i wear many hats so i

1620
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,439
uh when i was doing this because as an

1621
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:32,319
academic um

1622
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:34,479
lecturer then is quite easy because as

1623
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:35,839
part of my

1624
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:38,319
my responsibility i'm able to do three

1625
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:40,479
things research teaching

1626
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,880
and doing public services or consultants

1627
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,920
so

1628
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,359
it's quite easy going out as an academic

1629
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:50,560
to ask for that but uh if you want to do

1630
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,399
uh research on sustainable business

1631
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:53,679
model then

1632
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:55,040
at least you have to have some

1633
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,800
commercial aspects

1634
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,080
out of which where there is a limited uh

1635
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,239
capacity for the academic institution to

1636
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,920
do that that's why you also need to have

1637
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:06,800
maybe

1638
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,000
going out and starting

1639
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,840
correcting some revenue

1640
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,719
to see is it sustainable and

1641
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:16,320
qatar you also mentioned something

1642
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,320
important like um

1643
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,440
uh uh tv white space vendors uh

1644
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,320
you know even still yeah voices very

1645
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,400
very difficult yeah devices are still

1646
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,880
expensive and um

1647
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,800
what i'm also doing as part of my

1648
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,400
academic uh

1649
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,600
roles we are now working with um

1650
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,600
i have few masters students who are

1651
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,880
working on

1652
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,600
open audio and open software for tv

1653
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,600
white space

1654
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,840
if devices you know because uh these

1655
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,080
courses are coming very expensive

1656
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,040
because

1657
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,719
um

1658
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:54,000
uh having the the the the very expensive

1659
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,640
devices it also makes difficult to have

1660
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,719
a sustainable business mode out of which

1661
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:00,719
but we are hoping that

1662
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:02,480
once we have

1663
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,600
um

1664
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,600
the the economy of scales if we have

1665
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,199
many deployments in africa then you find

1666
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:12,000
the cost of the devices will roll down

1667
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,040
going out going to like uh

1668
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,320
it might not go like wi-fi devices but

1669
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,199
to some extent they will go down once we

1670
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:24,560
have many countries like uh passing out

1671
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,400
the regressions like what south africa

1672
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,960
has done because the the the south so

1673
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,840
that south africa is the only casa is

1674
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,760
the only regretta who has already

1675
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:34,960
approved

1676
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,199
the tv where space regression has

1677
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:39,280
already gone to commercial

1678
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,920
deployment so if we have many african

1679
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,199
countries

1680
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:44,560
having

1681
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:47,360
regression in process then there is a

1682
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,080
must a mass production of devices and

1683
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,920
the price will go down

1684
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,640
and maybe something that i also wanted

1685
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,360
to add up with that uh maybe for for

1686
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,360
jenny and few other

1687
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,360
fellows who we are trying to push the

1688
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,520
concept of community network

1689
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,520
it is very important that when we are

1690
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,679
supporting community network

1691
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:10,159
we should try to have

1692
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,920
a working case

1693
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,920
in their context

1694
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,280
that means for example if we are

1695
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,400
supporting

1696
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,360
maybe a community network in drc

1697
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,000
we should try to analyze the regulatory

1698
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,199
framework

1699
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:25,440
and be a point where

1700
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,199
this community network can be able to

1701
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:28,400
get either

1702
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,280
a prototype or maybe just to set up a

1703
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,760
proof of concept even if it's not a kind

1704
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,360
of a commercial

1705
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,920
per se full commercial per se but at

1706
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,560
least in a way they should be able to

1707
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,840
have

1708
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,520
a proof of concept

1709
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,080
within the current regulatory framework

1710
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,880
because what is happening now is that

1711
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,880
we have a lot of people in africa who

1712
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,679
are advocating for community networks

1713
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:56,320
but they don't really have any community

1714
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:59,040
in their locations then it's become very

1715
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,840
difficult to to make a point to move

1716
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,199
forward

1717
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:06,480
but if if these people in their context

1718
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,840
they could find a way of getting

1719
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,120
maybe

1720
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,960
a permission or a

1721
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,000
trial or license or something like that

1722
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
for for just a proof of concept to

1723
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,560
demonstrate that it's become very easy

1724
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,560
for the government to buy in i think

1725
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,880
that's something that uh i normally give

1726
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,840
out when someone reach out that matagoro

1727
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,840
because most of the people are coming up

1728
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,239
that we want to set up this and these

1729
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:34,880
days but what i try a device that try to

1730
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,320
understand

1731
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:39,360
your regulatory frameworks and find a

1732
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,560
way where

1733
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,360
even before getting the fund

1734
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,159
you you have a way that if i have a

1735
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:48,960
funding then i can buy equipment i can

1736
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,760
use this technology and then i can have

1737
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,840
the first deployment maybe within the

1738
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,480
first quarter of our of the project in

1739
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,960
that way you find things we will move

1740
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,920
very fast but uh having people talking a

1741
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,560
lot without having a proof of concept on

1742
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,400
board then it's become difficult thank

1743
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,159
you

1744
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:11,040
and this is a perfect segue over to um

1745
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,520
oh katana do you want to jump in no no

1746
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,400
no

1747
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,679
it's okay i think i'm the same i i am

1748
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:18,719
also

1749
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:22,880
a professor so i i use this position to

1750
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,080
to do many things that

1751
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,800
normal people are not support can not

1752
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,880
allow to do

1753
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,960
so

1754
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,080
anyway

1755
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:37,040
the idea is that um you really need to

1756
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,040
have you know a working

1757
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,199
working community network

1758
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,280
and then you can convince

1759
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:46,480
a regulator or policy maker so right now

1760
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:49,600
we got a lot of requests from

1761
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,640
from

1762
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,280
government people to visit our

1763
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,239
network

1764
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:55,520
our site

1765
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,239
so even uh parliamentary and

1766
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:01,440
yes you know asking for to visit our

1767
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,560
community network so uh you have to

1768
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,600
start

1769
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,679
for making something that works even

1770
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:09,520
though it's not connected to the

1771
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,960
internet you know

1772
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,280
local community network and have good uh

1773
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:18,239
utilization and application within the

1774
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:20,719
community and that

1775
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:22,719
is very important something that they

1776
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:24,640
can see they can

1777
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,280
really uh they would appreciate

1778
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,640
what you're doing

1779
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,400
yeah

1780
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,280
so that's it thank you

1781
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,520
you can channel it's always

1782
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,360
important to hear from you because

1783
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,960
you're actually like javera on the

1784
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,960
ground making something work and also

1785
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,880
working on the research side so this is

1786
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,239
really important

1787
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,000
not only for the guy activity but for

1788
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,440
everyone else out there who knows that

1789
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,120
you're trying to hack something and make

1790
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,280
it work it's not just a hack i mean it's

1791
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,199
a longer-term solution but it has to be

1792
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:54,960
that it's actually viable

1793
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,400
um right

1794
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,080
the regulators and policy makers can

1795
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:58,960
really

1796
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,199
uh help us and and if they're not

1797
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:02,960
believers as you said jaber you've got

1798
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,600
to show them the same with kanchana yeah

1799
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,920
um i'm gonna use this so they they even

1800
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:12,320
say it's only kanjinaku who can do it

1801
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,679
well

1802
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:15,199
and i think what it will

1803
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:16,239
happily

1804
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,000

know to to hold the hold the hold the

1808
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,719
line

who wears many hats um but has been

1813
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,840
doing great work on spectrum with apc

1814
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,280
and other and we're going to turn over

1815

madagora uh i'm gonna try and share my

1822
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:03,239
screen

1823
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,960
uh does that can everyone see my uh

1824
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,320
screen all right

1825
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,159
yeah perfect

1826
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:25,280
okay

1827
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,760
um so i mean i i

1828
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,199
all of the discussions so far um

1829
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:33,679
both kanchanas and matagora's experience

1830
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:36,239
resonate with me is this is a

1831
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:38,000
access to spectrum is something i've

1832
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,159
been been working on for for a number of

1833
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:41,199
years

1834
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,480
um

1835
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:45,120
in a variety of roles so i'm a half-time

1836
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,520
policy advisor with a mozilla

1837
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,239
corporation i work with the apc on

1838
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:51,920
policy and regulation for community

1839
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,040
networks

1840
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,560
um and i've also worked with nsrc and

1841
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,920
other institutions on on these issues

1842
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,159
um i think the biggest problem you know

1843
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:04,159
we have to contextualize the issue of

1844
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,320
spectrum it's not just an academic issue

1845
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,920
it's not just a

1846
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,080
a kind of theoretical problem it's it's

1847
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,960
a real problem we face today because

1848
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,239
um what we see is declining

1849
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:19,199
growth in the spread of of um of

1850
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:21,280
internet infrastructure so there are

1851
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,640
more and more people getting connected

1852
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,239
but they're getting connected at a

1853
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:26,239
slower and slower rate and that applies

1854
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:28,080
to the internet it also applies to to

1855
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,520
mobile users

1856
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:33,520
in general and the reason why is um is

1857
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,159
pretty straightforward

1858
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:37,920
you know and you could sum it up in one

1859
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,760
sentence and saying you know we've

1860
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,560
connected the easy half of the world

1861
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,679
the the the unconnected now are the

1862
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,600
people with the lowest ability to pay

1863
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,360
living in the most challenging areas

1864
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,679
often sparsely populated

1865
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:53,440
so um

1866
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,760
we uh we need to

1867
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,000
you know think of the different ways of

1868
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,320
solving the problem because current

1869
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,800
approaches are not enough i mean they

1870
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,640
have achieved remarkable things but they

1871
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,280
are they are not enough and i think this

1872
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,520
has really come home as a result of the

1873
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,679
pandemic right you know because you know

1874
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:13,199
what we've learned from the pandemic is

1875
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:14,800
not just the importance of of

1876
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,960
connectivity but the importance of

1877
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,159
inclusion

1878
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:21,360
because if you have access to

1879
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,120
the internet during the pandemic you can

1880
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,560
survive a lockdown you know in terms of

1881
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,960
you know being able to access education

1882
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,280
um you know continue to

1883
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:34,239
participate in the in the workforce

1884
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:37,360
and to stay abreast of of changes that

1885
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,440
that are that are affecting everyone

1886
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,520
whereas if you have no access all of

1887
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,920
that you are excluded from and as the

1888
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,360
resource that is the internet gets

1889
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,120
better and better you know people

1890
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,880
without access are falling further and

1891
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,679
further behind even by just standing

1892
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:52,640
still

1893
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:53,440
so

1894
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,600
it tells me you know the lesson i

1895
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,679
learned from this is that inclusion is

1896
01:19:57,679 --> 01:19:59,760
actually the policy

1897
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,159
strat the policy directive we need to go

1898
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:04,080
after as opposed to simply competition

1899
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:07,520
which is how most regulation is um

1900
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,159
is formulated these days

1901
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:12,000
so i i think of it this way i mean i

1902
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,560
would describe it as um you know telecom

1903
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,880
regulation as being like a like a

1904
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,600
filling a jar with stones

1905
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,520
so you know if you can imagine taking a

1906
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,400
fist-sized stone and sticking it in in a

1907
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,400
in a glass jar there may be three or

1908
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,000
four or five you can fit in the jar and

1909
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,760
the jar seems full

1910
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,199
but

1911
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:32,960
if you fill that jar with water actually

1912
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,440
the water occupies still more than 50 of

1913
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,639
the volume

1914
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:38,719
uh so what we need from a regulatory

1915
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:39,920
point of view

1916
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:44,080
is regulation that enables is designed

1917
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,080
to enable smaller operators so they can

1918
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,639
fill in those niche gaps those those

1919
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:51,360
other areas whether it's with uh niche

1920
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,760
technologies or with

1921
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,679
different business models

1922
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:56,480
and

1923
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,800
that we can begin to see

1924
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,239
you know achieve inclusion by allowing

1925
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:05,760
these smaller more nimble more um

1926
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,840
innovative operators whether they are

1927
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,600
community networks or non-profit

1928
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,719
operators to fully uh achieve in

1929
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:15,679
affordable internet access for all

1930
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:16,480
so

1931
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:19,040
when that comes to spectrum

1932
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,040
we basically have

1933
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:21,840
two

1934
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,320
types of spectrum that we can talk about

1935
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,280
um

1936
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,920
which is unlicensed or licensed so

1937
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,080
unlicensed or licensed exempt spectrum

1938
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:33,040
is what we popularly know as wi-fi

1939
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,719
and um

1940
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:37,600
i should say the reason we have

1941
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,400
uh

1942
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,320
licenses the reason why we have spectrum

1943
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,639
management is to is for one reason only

1944
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,719
which is to manage interference

1945
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:46,719
so that one person's use of the wireless

1946
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:49,040
spectrum does not impede the use of

1947
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,159
another

1948
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:51,840
and the two approaches here of doing

1949
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,920
that um are

1950
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,880
embedded in either

1951
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:59,920
written regulations or in

1952
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,600
with regulations embedded in the

1953
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,480
technology itself so with license exempt

1954
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:07,760
wi-fi use the the the rules are embedded

1955
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,440
in the technology itself so wi-fi

1956
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,760
first of all speaks very quietly so you

1957
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,520
know if you can imagine a crowded room

1958
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,040
where everybody's whispering with each

1959
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:17,840
other

1960
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,920
everything you know it works very well

1961
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,960
whereas if everybody started shouting um

1962
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,880
it it would be difficult for people to

1963
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,199
understand each other and wi-fi is also

1964
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:29,840
very polite so the rules embedded there

1965
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,560
uh include a listen before talk mode

1966
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,159
which means that if somebody else is

1967
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:36,960
using the wi-fi spectrum then the wi-fi

1968
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,760
device waits until uh until they're

1969
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,400
finished and that has enabled

1970
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:45,679
the massive proliferation of of of wi-fi

1971
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:48,480
devices simply by embedding these simple

1972
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,840
rules

1973
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,080
uh in the devices whereas licensed

1974
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,400
technology um

1975
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,560
creates an exclusion zone for the

1976
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,639
spectrum user typically this is a

1977
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:02,239
national license that sets out a certain

1978
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:04,960
range of frequencies that are

1979
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,199
completely cleared for that operator's

1980
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:08,560
use and

1981
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,480
now because the demand for that spectrum

1982
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:13,360
has gone up the um

1983
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:17,679
um the cost of that spectrum has grown

1984
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:19,440
so um

1985
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,960
you know when we give access to spectrum

1986
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,080
uh you know you know such as wi-fi you

1987
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,960
know amazing things happen you know they

1988
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:31,400
we we've seen wi-fi turn into a

1989
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:35,120
multi-trillion dollar industry

1990
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,840
um you know in in over the course of the

1991
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,639
last sort of 15 years or so but it has

1992
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:43,840
limitations and the limitation is really

1993
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,480
in that power output

1994
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,520
because

1995
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,400
you know if you want to cover a uh an

1996
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,120
entire town or a village you may need

1997
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,520
dozens or even hundreds of wi-fi devices

1998
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,880
to be

1999
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,520
actually able to offer coverage whereas

2000
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,679
in licensed spectrum where the power

2001
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:04,320
output levels are are allowed to be much

2002
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,360
higher

2003
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,440
a single base station could cover an

2004
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,199
entire town so there's this kind of

2005
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:10,480
tension

2006
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,159
um

2007
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:13,679
between the two

2008
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,639
and um while mobile has been extremely

2009
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:17,920
successful

2010
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:18,880
it's

2011
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,920
uh kind of a victim of its own success

2012
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,800
especially in emerging markets so here's

2013
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,760
some examples of um

2014
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,040
of prices paid at auction

2015
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:34,560
uh by operators in sub-saharan africa

2016
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,679
and you can see that um you know the the

2017
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:40,000
the sums paid are are significant you

2018
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,280
know i

2019
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:45,440
you point out uh in nigeria in 19 2016

2020
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,040
um mtn paid nearly a hundred million

2021
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:52,480
dollars uh for a spectrum license in 2.6

2022
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:55,920
gigahertz um which you know has many

2023
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,080
consequences one is they have to recruit

2024
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,840
that hundred million dollars so where

2025
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,120
are they going to invest their

2026
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,719
technology well they're going to invest

2027
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:04,800
their technology where they're most

2028
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,199
likely to gain returns

2029
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:10,719
and uh which which has an impact on

2030
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:14,000
on rural rollout and um

2031
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,760
uh and you know

2032
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,840
uh regulators and governments uh

2033
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,440
recognize this to some degree and have

2034
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,280
attempted you know programs like

2035
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,440
universal service funds to kind of

2036
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,600
stimulate the rural

2037
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:30,080
rural rollout but it has been a limited

2038
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:33,520
success in in pushing that and so the

2039
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,040
but the real for me you know in the

2040
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:38,159
context of this conversation um

2041
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:41,040
the real negative output of of spectrum

2042
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,679
auctions while it has enabled these big

2043
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:46,239
stones in the jar these big operators

2044
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:48,880
it has effectively locked out smaller

2045
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,239
operators from access to

2046
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:53,199
to

2047
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,120
spectrum and technology which is

2048
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:58,639
becoming more and more affordable

2049
01:25:58,639 --> 01:25:59,679
um

2050
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:02,159
so you know and and attempts to address

2051
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:05,520
this kind of disconnect uh between

2052
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,760
uh you know exclusively licensed

2053
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,639
spectrum and license exempt have

2054
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:12,960
been growing over the last sort of you

2055
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,040
know 10 to 15 years the first of its

2056
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:15,920
kind

2057
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,760
uh you've already heard about today

2058
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:21,199
which is uh tv white space spectrum so

2059
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:23,360
that's an attempt to reuse the

2060
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:26,080
television broadcast frequencies and

2061
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,120
thanks to advocacy from a variety of

2062
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,880
actors uh in um

2063
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,840
in sub-saharan africa

2064
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,760
um tv white space regulation has

2065
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:40,080
actually emerged into formal regulation

2066
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,080
from pilots that began as far back as

2067
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,840
2013

2068
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,120
um

2069
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,840
to actual formal regulation in kenya in

2070
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,480
mozambique and and south africa

2071
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,080
which is great

2072
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,360
however

2073
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,760
the barrier to you to using these

2074
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,280
technologies

2075
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,280
has to be compared against license

2076
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:02,719
exempt uh spectrum so a wi-fi you know

2077
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:04,239
for a couple of hundred dollars i can

2078
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:06,719
put up a broadband link that's you know

2079
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:09,040
that is hundreds of megabits per second

2080
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,520
um and it's it's pretty much plug and

2081
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:12,560
play

2082
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,600
um

2083
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:16,080
with tv white space uh there is a

2084
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,480
geolocation database which must be

2085
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,639
logged into by the device the equipment

2086
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:23,120
is more expensive and often you know

2087
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,040
there are fees associated with the use

2088
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,040
of that database and even the process

2089
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,760
for the regulator of authorizing a

2090
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:33,840
database provider has turned out to be

2091
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:36,239
um

2092
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,560
a challenge in that it's it's kind of

2093
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,719
new ground in that the the use of a

2094
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:43,840
spectrum geolocation database uh is uh

2095
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,400
is novel and therefore you know it's

2096
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:50,000
slow going for the implementation so

2097
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,239
tv white space has been very frustrating

2098
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:55,040
as a technology in terms of its uptake

2099
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:55,840
for

2100
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,480
um for those reasons i think if tv white

2101
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,960
space is going to succeed

2102
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,679
um then it has to be compared to wi-fi

2103
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:06,400
in terms of regulation it has to be a as

2104
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,560
easy to use

2105
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,400
as wi-fi and it has to be in the same

2106
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,960
realm of affordability because really

2107
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,239
you know if you were thinking about

2108
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:16,560
deploying a tv white space technology to

2109
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,800
get through some foliage or to you know

2110
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,120
solve a an obstruction

2111
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,960
you have to consider well wouldn't it be

2112
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,120
easier just to build another wi-fi tower

2113
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,679
and solve it that way so that's the bar

2114
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:29,520
that has to be met

2115
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:30,400
um

2116
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,560
and uh so i think you know for instance

2117
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,000
regulators need to consider like

2118
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,040
creating an incubatory period where um

2119
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,960
there are zero fees for the use of tv

2120
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,440
white space technologies and they you

2121
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,840
know they you know a moratorium on on

2122
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,440
import duties on tv white space

2123
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,679
technologies it has to be stimulated if

2124
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:49,199
it's not stimulated

2125
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:51,920
then i think um it's it's really going

2126
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,080
to struggle in terms of uptake as a

2127
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,560
technology

2128
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,719
but i think there's another space here

2129
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:01,199
that has emerged over the last sort of

2130
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:03,920
i'd say five to five to eight years and

2131
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:06,080
that's using shared spectrum

2132
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,159
but not in the way the tb white space

2133
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:10,000
which is a kind of dedicated access

2134
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,679
technology that's unique in and of

2135
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,520
itself

2136
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,800
but rather

2137
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,719
in the use of shared imt spectrum so imt

2138
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:21,400
stands for international mobile

2139
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:23,360
telecommunications and that's the that's

2140
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:26,000
the spectrum that the big operators use

2141
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,320
so the um

2142
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,280
uh mobile spectrum as we know it comes

2143
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:33,920
in many flavors now it used to be you

2144
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,679
know in the origin of gsm there were

2145
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:37,600
like two or three bands and they varied

2146
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,440
a little from

2147
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,000
from region to region but now you know

2148
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,679
lte for example has 40 bands that that

2149
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:48,960
are possible to use um for lte services

2150
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:52,159
which opens up a range of possibilities

2151
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:53,679
um

2152
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:56,480
and to date typically operator or

2153
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,719
regulators are only releasing that via

2154
01:29:58,719 --> 01:29:59,760
auction

2155
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,760
and yet

2156
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,840
realizing that

2157
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,320
for many of these licenses that they are

2158
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:07,440
issuing

2159
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,920
the uptake in rural areas

2160
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,120
is is very very low or are non-existent

2161
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,920
by uh by operators so there's this

2162
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,960
spectrum that's not being used um and

2163
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,120
it's and because of these exclusive used

2164
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,600
licenses um there's just no way of

2165
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,560
accessing it so uh that's the change

2166
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,480
we're seeing now and the change that i

2167
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,639
think you know as civil society we need

2168
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:33,600
to have more and more conversations

2169
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,080
with regulators about this and and i'll

2170
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,320
just talk about some some examples of

2171
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,080
how this has been done

2172
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:43,280
so in mexico in 2016

2173
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,840
uh the regulator set aside a specific

2174
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,800
amount of imt spectrum

2175
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:52,000
for use by social purpose organizations

2176
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,639
for access uh in underserved communities

2177
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:57,040
and by indigenous communities so that's

2178
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,800
one way in that there is enough spectrum

2179
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,159
out there that um that you can carve out

2180
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:04,000
a piece of imt spectrum and say look

2181
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,920
this is for social use and uh without

2182
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:10,800
actually impacting the uh the needs of

2183
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:13,280
of the largest operators

2184
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,440
the united states has adopted a fairly

2185
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:18,400
complex approach to spectrum sharing

2186
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,080
with a three-tiered approach called the

2187
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,320
citizens broadband radio service which

2188
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:25,040
operates in 3.5 gigahertz and that has

2189
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:27,360
exclusive licenses owned by the

2190
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,840
government

2191
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:32,320
um a middle tier of licenses which are

2192
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,520
ten-year

2193
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,920
called power licenses ten-year licenses

2194
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:38,400
but owned that apply to a a much smaller

2195
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,840
geographic area and then a third tier uh

2196
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:44,320
which is the general access which is

2197
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:47,440
kind of wi-fi like so it it it it allows

2198
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:50,320
for a range of different uses but it's

2199
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,080
it's kind of very unique to the

2200
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,080
situation that the us finds itself in

2201
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:56,880
and having the us military as the the

2202
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,639
primary user

2203
01:31:58,639 --> 01:31:59,920
um

2204
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:02,080
and and it is a database driven approach

2205
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,239
much like inspired by tv white space

2206
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:06,080
technologies

2207
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,960
a different approach has been taken

2208
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,800
by the united kingdom

2209
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,639
in uh issuing two different kinds of

2210
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:15,360
licenses a local access license and a

2211
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,520
shared access license and that addresses

2212
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,639
both like

2213
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:21,360
existing licenses and unused spectrum as

2214
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:25,280
well so a shared access license

2215
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:28,400
has set aside spectrum a bit like mexico

2216
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,480
and said this spectrum will be shared

2217
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:33,280
and we will issue kind of

2218
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,360
licenses as and where

2219
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,520
we see fit in this band

2220
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,760
the local access license is is

2221
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,760
interesting in that it operates on

2222
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,199
existing

2223
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:44,400
uh

2224
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,400
spectrum licenses owned by the big

2225
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,400
operators and it says where big

2226
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,840
operators have not expressed an

2227
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,320
intention to deploy infrastructure we

2228
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,400
will consider and issue

2229
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:58,080
uh local access licenses to allow reuse

2230
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:01,120
of that spectrum and that is super

2231
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,639
exciting and it's based on this

2232
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:03,760
principle

2233
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,320
uh of use it or share it in spectrum

2234
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,560
licenses and this is the big change that

2235
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:09,600
needs

2236
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,480
civil society advocacy with regulator to

2237
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,000
change the way

2238
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,639
spectrum licenses are issued so right

2239
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:19,440
now spectrum licenses in general

2240
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:22,239
guarantee exclusivity to the license

2241
01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:23,360
holder

2242
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,440
but what we want rather

2243
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,360
is to guarantee protection of

2244
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:28,719
interference

2245
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:30,960
guarantee protection from interference

2246
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,960
from the license holder

2247
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:35,600
and that creates a mechanism for then

2248
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,760
the regulator to set it to open up

2249
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,520
access to spectrum

2250
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,920
where the incumbent is not using it and

2251
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,159
i think the you for me the uk is the is

2252
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:46,400
the pioneer in this area and in fact

2253
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,560
canada is now in the midst of a

2254
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,000
consultation

2255
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,320
on a shared access to spectrum for rural

2256
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:53,360
areas

2257
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,199
that is that is very much based on the

2258
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:57,280
uk approach

2259
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:00,239
and finally in new zealand

2260
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:03,360
for years they have operated a managed

2261
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:06,159
spectrum park so rather than issuing a

2262
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:09,840
license in 2.5 gigahertz to one operator

2263
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,840
for the entire country

2264
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:13,760
they've said we're taking this band and

2265
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,800
it's only 40 megahertz of spectrum

2266
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,440
and uh and we're going to you know issue

2267
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:22,159
local licenses for it and and treat it

2268
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:25,520
as a pla as a spectrum frequency to

2269
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:29,520
enable uh small operators and so this is

2270
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,760
the frontier from my perspective and

2271
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,800
it's what can really unlock access to

2272
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:38,320
for small operators to deliver services

2273
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:42,239
via lte and even 5g which has you know a

2274
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:44,320
big impact you know in terms of the

2275
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,960
reach of the of the technology versus

2276
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,880
wi-fi and also you know being able to

2277
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:53,679
speak directly uh to uh to handsets

2278
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:57,040
uh so that's it really i think that um

2279
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:00,400
you know i i think canton is right in

2280
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,920
in one point from one point of view in

2281
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,760
that you know you need to have practical

2282
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,400
examples uh to build on uh with the

2283
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,080
regulator but i think it's also

2284
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:10,400
important to to to

2285
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,880
speak to the regulator to reveal these

2286
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,280
other things that are going on because

2287
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,679
you know the problem of rural access

2288
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:20,560
exists everywhere and unless we have

2289
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,880
mechanisms to unlock access to spectrum

2290
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,040
in rural areas we're not going to

2291
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:28,159
support solve the problem of affordable

2292
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:31,040
access to internet for for everyone

2293
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,280
so with that um i thank you and

2294
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:37,239
certainly welcome any questions

2295
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,040
i want to have one quick question maybe

2296
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,880
i'll get the

2297
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,960
others thinking um

2298
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,560
when you say that canada is taking a

2299
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,480
look at um

2300
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,239
following in the footsteps potentially

2301
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:02,239
of the uk and i couldn't agree with you

2302
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:04,719
more uk has really done an amazing job

2303
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:06,719
um what do you mean by that i know we

2304
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:08,080
have proceedings going on there are

2305
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:10,000
requests for comments what does that

2306
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,679
mean if you can explain to some folks on

2307
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:13,600
the call who may not actually

2308
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:16,000
know what an rfc well they know in rs in

2309
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,400
this context of the ietf obviously but a

2310
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:19,920
request for comments from our government

2311
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:22,080
it's a similar issue but

2312
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:25,360
what's the consequences there

2313
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,600
great so um

2314
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:29,320
regulator spectrum rate or

2315
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:31,360
telecommunications regulators are

2316
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:34,800
statutory bodies and they they operate

2317
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,679
in very similar ways in in almost every

2318
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:39,520
country in that when they wish to

2319
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,960
introduce

2320
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,960
new regulation

2321
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:46,719
they um they often commission a research

2322
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:50,320
piece and uh and issue a consultation

2323
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,880
and these consultations uh issued by

2324
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,600
regulators are super important uh they

2325
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,840
are kind of teachable moments in policy

2326
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:00,320
and regulation because it is the one

2327
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:04,000
moment where the regulator has to listen

2328
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,600
to anyone who makes a submission they

2329
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,679
have to take into account what you've

2330
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:09,119
said and

2331
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:10,800
and demonstrate that they have taken it

2332
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,440
into account so if you want to

2333
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:14,320
uh

2334
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,400
you know um

2335
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,880
have an impact in terms of influencing

2336
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,480
regulation responding to these

2337
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:24,639
consultations you know is absolutely

2338
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:27,119
critical because they are it is the the

2339
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:30,639
moment when the regulator is most open

2340
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:32,239
to um

2341
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:35,119
to input so um

2342
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:36,000
uh

2343
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,760
you know seizing the day in these

2344
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:40,639
consultations is is key and that can be

2345
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:44,480
intimidating right um and uh and hard so

2346
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:47,440
um i will say that one thing that um

2347
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,119
that we've been doing

2348
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:52,239
and i say we with my apc hat on

2349
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:54,000
um is

2350
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,040
is

2351
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:57,119
we've been capturing all of the

2352
01:37:57,119 --> 01:38:00,880
submissions that we've been making to

2353
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:03,440
new regulators on a wiki and i'll put

2354
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:05,760
the link to the wiki there but so if you

2355
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:08,000
are you know if you were in the k in the

2356
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,840
situation where there is a consultation

2357
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:12,239
by the regulator on license exempt or tb

2358
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:14,000
white space or

2359
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,560
spectrum sharing you can look at other

2360
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,320
submissions from civil society

2361
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,719
organizations and use that as kind of

2362
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:23,040
grist for your thinking mill to

2363
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:25,520
uh to decide how how to input i think

2364
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,239
there's a great need for a larger voice

2365
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:30,800
by civil society with regulators which

2366
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,480
are typically dominated by the big

2367
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:35,440
operators um but we need to work

2368
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,600
together you know to share the knowledge

2369
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,520
that we're gaining in terms of you know

2370
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:44,440
uh how to have the most effective voice

2371
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,239
we don't do that

2372
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:54,159
we end up with a statement quo so i

2373
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:55,760
think um

2374
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:58,159
kantana actually you're in the queue so

2375
01:38:58,159 --> 01:39:01,040
go ahead kanchana

2376
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:09,360
thank you very much steve

2377
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,880
i really

2378
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:14,800
learned a lot from your presentation

2379
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:18,320
i really did not mean that we need we

2380
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:21,600
shouldn't ignore uh talking to regulate

2381
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,920
i mean convincing regulator

2382
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:27,440
i think it's that job of someone like

2383
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:28,239
you

2384
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:30,080
to do that

2385
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,320
okay

2386
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:35,360
for us inside the country we need to

2387
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:39,280
convince them and show them that we need

2388
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,440
you know we need spectrum we need this

2389
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,320
kind of thing but we need to show them

2390
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:47,119
by working example

2391
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:50,639
and for people like yourself uh can

2392
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:53,520
convince them from the outside

2393
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:56,239
from internationally you can

2394
01:39:56,239 --> 01:39:59,360
provide a kind of picture and

2395
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:02,719
convince them i i think uh this is we

2396
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:04,480
need to work together

2397
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:05,280
and

2398
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:08,960
i'm sure uh there's no one not one way

2399
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:11,119
there are many ways but we need to

2400
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:13,520
collaborate

2401
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:14,960
all right thank you

2402
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:19,400
100 i couldn't agree more

2403
01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:37,440
i've stunned the audience into silence

2404
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,919
you have

2405
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:44,080
yeah maybe uh steve um

2406
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:48,560
you you delivered a very um

2407
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:51,280
a very wonderful presentation during the

2408
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:52,800
first um

2409
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,960
digital transformation with telnet and

2410
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,040
um

2411
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:58,880
it it sounds like the concept of

2412
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:00,880
community network which you mentioned

2413
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,840
during the conference

2414
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:05,440
was a very positive

2415
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:08,239
uh to the audience and uh

2416
01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:10,639
it's unfortunate that margaret is is no

2417
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:13,280
longer internet and there is a i think a

2418
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,360
new acting ceo

2419
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:17,119
and um

2420
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:19,600
stefan i think we we need to find a way

2421
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,280
on

2422
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,199
how to extend the discussion maybe i was

2423
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:25,840
as part of this uh i was just

2424
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:28,560
asking have you managed to

2425
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:31,760
extend further the discussion beyond the

2426
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:32,880
conference

2427
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:35,199
or there is um

2428
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:36,639
something

2429
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:39,520
like rock engagement because i know

2430
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,920
recently i think ternate has been

2431
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:44,560
listed as one of

2432
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:46,400
the national isp

2433
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:49,520
so and i'm also aware that uh

2434
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:52,159
uh ubuntu ions and they think a web bank

2435
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:53,840
something like that they they they are

2436
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,119
supporting

2437
01:41:55,119 --> 01:41:58,719
uh broadband through telnet and i have

2438
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:01,199
have seen kernet in kenya doing a rot

2439
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:04,480
with with the same the same the same

2440
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:05,840
bandwidth

2441
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,040
so

2442
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:10,080
maybe basing on your existing

2443
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:13,119
networks and i i know that nsrc is also

2444
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:17,119
supporting telnet in a number of events

2445
01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:21,520
i'm just curious to see how can we

2446
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,840
try to extend the same discussion and

2447
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,920
bring them on board

2448
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:26,840
if they

2449
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:30,159
could support the community but because

2450
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:31,840
one of the discussion they normally say

2451
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:32,960
that

2452
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:36,159
they don't have the infrastructure

2453
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:40,800
especially uh to beyond that sram

2454
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:43,360
and but i know they have

2455
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:44,960
a good

2456
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:48,159
cooperation with the other esp like ttcl

2457
01:42:48,159 --> 01:42:49,760
and others

2458
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:50,639
so

2459
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:51,600
if we

2460
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:54,840
if we build a good case

2461
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:58,880
then it will easing for for us who are

2462
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,480
pushing for

2463
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:02,239
alternative and complementary approach

2464
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:04,639
like community network

2465
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:06,719
to take advantage of the bandwidth they

2466
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:08,719
have because something staying there is

2467
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:11,040
something no one is using it while we

2468
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:12,960
are struggling

2469
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:15,600
in in a rural area with a lot of people

2470
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,760
disconnected i

2471
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,760
maybe i could be

2472
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:24,639
up to here on on top of that thank you

2473
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:27,840
thanks monica matagora um yeah so what

2474
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:30,000
um

2475
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,159
what madagura is referring to is i i

2476
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:35,280
gave a talk uh to the national research

2477
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:38,080
and education network of tanzania

2478
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:39,040
a

2479
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:41,119
month ago and i talked about access to

2480
01:43:41,119 --> 01:43:43,760
the national fiber optic backbone um

2481
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:46,080
because i mean access to spectrum is

2482
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:49,199
important and it is key but but if you

2483
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:50,719
can't get access to a high-speed

2484
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:53,119
backbone then your

2485
01:43:53,119 --> 01:43:55,600
spectrum is um

2486
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:58,000
well it's only a piece of the solution

2487
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,600
and in sub-saharan africa the

2488
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,840
uh there is a lot of fiber optic

2489
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:06,080
backbones uh they are you know over a

2490
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:08,159
million kilometers now of terrestrial

2491
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:09,600
fiber optic backbone but it's

2492
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,760
dramatically underutilized

2493
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:13,199
um

2494
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:15,920
and uh however

2495
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:16,880
um

2496
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:18,880
there has been a strong growth of

2497
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:20,880
national research and education networks

2498
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:23,040
particularly in

2499
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,360
uh in eastern and southern africa also

2500
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:27,040
but also west africa

2501
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:28,159
and

2502
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:30,000
those national research and education

2503
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,760
networks have a lot in common with

2504
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:34,000
community networks in that they are

2505
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,880
not-for-profit entities that

2506
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:38,719
share the cost

2507
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:43,040
of uh of access to uh um

2508
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:45,679
to the fiber optic backbone and i think

2509
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:49,199
that that is a very interesting model um

2510
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:51,440
that

2511
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:53,760
that has the potential to

2512
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:56,639
uh unlock access for non-profit

2513
01:44:56,639 --> 01:45:00,080
operators and community networks in that

2514
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:01,520
because these national research and

2515
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:03,760
education networks are already operating

2516
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:05,840
national uh

2517
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:08,239
high-speed networks they can extend that

2518
01:45:08,239 --> 01:45:12,000
access to uh to community networks um

2519
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,280
that that are near them i think the

2520
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:16,960
the challenge is once again one of

2521
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:19,760
regulation where um they have to be

2522
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:23,040
allowed to do that in uh often you know

2523
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:23,760
the

2524
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:25,520
they are constrained in only being able

2525
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,840
to connect educational

2526
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,920
institutions and they're often

2527
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:32,000
constrained as well in terms of how they

2528
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,719
are licensed versus how the commercial

2529
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:37,040
network operators are licenses uh

2530
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,199
licensed so in general i think there's

2531
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:41,679
this need to from a regulatory point of

2532
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:44,800
view to recognize non-profit operators

2533
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:46,159
and create

2534
01:45:46,159 --> 01:45:47,760
you know a different regulatory

2535
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:50,159
environment for non-profit operators

2536
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:51,840
ranging all the way from national

2537
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,480
research and education networks down to

2538
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:55,520
down to

2539
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:57,600
small network operators

2540
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:58,880
um

2541
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:00,480
and i think part of that begins with

2542
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:03,360
advocacy for for enrons in general in

2543
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:05,199
that i i find them to be under

2544
01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:06,960
recognized by

2545
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:09,679
um by ministries of education or

2546
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:11,440
ministries of telecommunications they

2547
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:13,440
don't see them as the

2548
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:17,040
uh the strategic national assets that

2549
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,360
that they are because you know access to

2550
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:22,320
high-speed internet is is the cinequanon

2551
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:25,119
of a modern university so

2552
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:27,760
uh yeah there's much more that uh that

2553
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:30,560
can be done there

2554
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:36,800
thank you for the plug um for enrons

2555
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:39,119
amazing uh resources that i couldn't

2556
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:40,639
agree more underutilized or

2557
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:42,239
under-recognized

2558
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:44,000
i put something quickly in the chat

2559
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,159
about um we're hearing more and more

2560
01:46:46,159 --> 01:46:48,560
about public access networks as well and

2561
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:50,560
put together by some municipalities

2562
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:51,600
where

2563
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,840
enron see uh community networks small

2564
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:56,480
isps could use those public access

2565
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:58,639
networks but it is a matter of a getting

2566
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:01,520
them built or be allowing more the regs

2567
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:03,520
and rules to change to allow for access

2568
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:04,400
there

2569
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:06,880
on interconnect

2570
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:09,280
i don't think we see any more questions

2571
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,760
in the uh folks in the queue

2572
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:14,000
um please use the gaia channel we could

2573
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,840
take questions there for i know steve i

2574
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,320
think you're in it as is um kanchana

2575
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,320
marco and jabera

2576
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:22,480
and i think what leandro and i will do

2577
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:25,040
is flip over to the great point made by

2578
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:27,440
marco about having um

2579
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:28,800
some uh

2580
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,719
informal meetings once a month

2581
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:32,719
potentially or every other month where

2582
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:34,960
people come together in between gaias to

2583
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,400
just talk about some of the issues that

2584
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:39,199
they have solutions that they're seeing

2585
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:41,600
almost sort of like a

2586
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:42,880
a group

2587
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,880
help session where people could talk and

2588
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,639
see each other but also stay in contact

2589
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:48,480
during um this difficult period where

2590
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:51,360
we're not actually traveling as much

2591
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:53,679
what i think leandro and i would suggest

2592
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:55,360
is that you can either email us directly

2593
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,840
or go through the gaia channel because

2594
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,360
we could um

2595
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,760
heck a solution there on how we could do

2596
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:02,880
it

2597
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:04,960
otherwise then if we don't see any more

2598
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,960
questions which i don't no one else is

2599
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:09,440
in the queue then we would thank steve

2600
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:13,360
uh matagoro uh kanchana and marco

2601
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:16,400
for coming with us today to provide some

2602
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:18,480
context to how to connect more people

2603
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:20,480
around the planet but also some of the

2604
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:21,920
technical solutions and regulatory

2605
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:23,440
policy solutions that are impacting the

2606
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:25,520
technical solutions for rollout

2607
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:26,800
um

2608
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,480
so thank you very much for joining us

2609
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:31,040
today and leandra any other final words

2610
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:33,840
before we close

2611
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:37,040
um yeah i had like a

2612
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:39,119
couple of slides just to

2613
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:41,679
to close the session

2614
01:48:41,679 --> 01:48:44,880
let me see if i can

2615
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:47,840
share the screen

2616
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,159
okay just to say that um this is a

2617
01:48:54,159 --> 01:48:56,719
recurrent topic

2618
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:58,880
and

2619
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,840
we have like a document that that is

2620
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:05,920
from uh august to 2016.

2621
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,360
and um

2622
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:09,280
and the other topic is well you already

2623
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:11,280
introduced the internet meetings

2624
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:13,360
so regarding the um

2625
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:14,480
the document

2626
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:17,119
that we published um

2627
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:18,719
like four years ago

2628
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:20,800
uh

2629
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:23,119
i wanted to just to to comment that uh

2630
01:49:23,119 --> 01:49:25,760
it's it's there but i think it's worth

2631
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:27,520
uh to do an update

2632
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:30,320
uh as this is my impression but i wanted

2633
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,800
to know more about the um

2634
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,080
impression of others so we need to

2635
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,639
discuss uh to what extent that the other

2636
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:40,080
rfc is is still useful as it is

2637
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:42,159
or we need to change focus uh to

2638
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:44,239
something that have has emerged in the

2639
01:49:44,239 --> 01:49:46,239
last few years like for instance what we

2640
01:49:46,239 --> 01:49:48,320
have covered in all the presentations of

2641
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:50,320
the gaia working group

2642
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:52,560
if it's feasible to update it

2643
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:54,000
for that we need volunteers we need

2644
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,800
people to to contribute text

2645
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:59,360
and coordinate the edition

2646
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:01,920
and then we can discuss about what parts

2647
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:04,400
must be updated what which parts must be

2648
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:05,679
extended

2649
01:50:05,679 --> 01:50:08,560
and and to that i don't know if you took

2650
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:10,159
a look at the

2651
01:50:10,159 --> 01:50:12,080
table of contents

2652
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:14,239
this is the table of contents of the of

2653
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:16,639
the of that rfc

2654
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:17,920
um

2655
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:19,040
and

2656
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:21,440
well it's detailed it talks about

2657
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:24,080
alternative networks uh there was

2658
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,480
some discussion about how to

2659
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:28,239
frame

2660
01:50:28,239 --> 01:50:29,679
the

2661
01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:32,560
space for uh let's say non-commercial

2662
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:34,960
operators and as steve was presented

2663
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:38,719
before how to throw a smaller stones

2664
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:39,920
into the jar

2665
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:41,599
to fill in the gap

2666
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:44,239
a gap that is measured in people

2667
01:50:44,239 --> 01:50:47,440
unconnected but is not measured in terms

2668
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:48,320
of

2669
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,679
business loss because there is no

2670
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:51,920
business sometimes in those areas that

2671
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:54,000
are not attractive for the commercial

2672
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,480
operators

2673
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:58,560
and then you can see in the middle that

2674
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,840
we discuss

2675
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,639
uh

2676
01:51:00,639 --> 01:51:03,760
types of alternative networks

2677
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:08,400
technologies employed and then some

2678
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:09,440
layering

2679
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:12,080
issues with them

2680
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:13,920
you can imagine that

2681
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,599
things have changed

2682
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:18,719
significantly in the last few years

2683
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:20,080
and

2684
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:22,480
if you just take a look at the document

2685
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:23,920
um

2686
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:25,760
here it is

2687
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:27,440
and you go through the

2688
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:28,960
document

2689
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:31,199
you will see that there are um

2690
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:32,480
many

2691
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:35,440
aspects that seem a little bit outdated

2692
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:36,960
and at least the

2693
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:39,040
vocabulary has changed

2694
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:42,080
and technologies not so much

2695
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:44,320
but still like uh

2696
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:45,360
there are

2697
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:48,159
certain paths to be to be updated so i

2698
01:51:48,159 --> 01:51:49,520
was just

2699
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:51,040
reminding people that the document is

2700
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,440
there if you can take a look

2701
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:55,119
uh and you see

2702
01:51:55,119 --> 01:51:57,760
something that is worth to be modified

2703
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:00,080
just let us know

2704
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,280
jane and me

2705
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:03,599
so we can see how many people is willing

2706
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:05,760
to

2707
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:08,400
renew the rfc

2708
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,080
and um

2709
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:12,639
you see for instance statistics from a

2710
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:14,080
few years ago

2711
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:16,400
that obviously need an update

2712
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:19,599
or um regarding technologies we learn

2713
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:21,679
things that works things that do not

2714
01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:24,320
work there are new opportunities

2715
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:27,040
so well let us know if you

2716
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:29,199
if you are willing to get involved a

2717
01:52:29,199 --> 01:52:31,119
little bit in a in a refresh of the

2718
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:34,159
document or a rewrite or whatever

2719
01:52:34,159 --> 01:52:35,760
and that was my

2720
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:37,520
my comment

2721
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:41,960
i don't know if anyone has any question

2722
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:52,480
it's not a question but um

2723
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:55,599
i think uh we it's something that we can

2724
01:52:55,599 --> 01:52:58,719
we can agree on how we can we can we can

2725
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:00,800
update because

2726
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:04,080
that time was uh very relevant and in in

2727
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:05,840
the current context

2728
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,840
there are some texts which need to be

2729
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,760
updated so

2730
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:13,119
i think coming through the guys is

2731
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:15,199
something that we we would we would we

2732
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:16,880
have to do and um

2733
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:18,880
uh to me personal i

2734
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:20,960
because we have been also struggling a

2735
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,800
lot in africa

2736
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:25,119
to engage the academia and

2737
01:53:25,119 --> 01:53:28,880
other uh experts in africa especially in

2738
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:30,960
the contribution of the

2739
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:35,119
rfc and i itf activities so

2740
01:53:35,119 --> 01:53:37,920
i think this could be things like a good

2741
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:41,199
start for for for the engagement because

2742
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:44,080
if if one participates to such kind of

2743
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:45,760
activity then

2744
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:48,000
you understand on

2745
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,400
how the request for comments can be

2746
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:53,280
updated and can be developed and things

2747
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:54,400
like that

2748
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:56,480
so i know we have been pushing that with

2749
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,880
kevin chegger from internet society and

2750
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:00,159
then

2751
01:54:00,159 --> 01:54:02,800
there is progress but the uptake is not

2752
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:05,280
it's not yet there because

2753
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:08,239
the the participation of most african

2754
01:54:08,239 --> 01:54:09,760
academia

2755
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:14,080
on the writing of rfcs is still

2756
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:16,080
very raw so i think

2757
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:18,320
i support it because

2758
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,800
we have some new context to update on

2759
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:24,000
the on the on the document but second

2760
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,239
also gaining the the

2761
01:54:26,239 --> 01:54:28,159
the participation and the active

2762
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:30,159
perspective because i see community

2763
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:32,000
network picking up

2764
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,360
very very strongly in africa so

2765
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:37,360
if we could also identify some few

2766
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:38,960
african

2767
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:41,199
resource people who could be part of it

2768
01:54:41,199 --> 01:54:44,159
then it also add value

2769
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:46,239
on the preview on the different agenda

2770
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:48,960
that we have been pushing having african

2771
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:52,159
people contributing to itf and rfc

2772
01:54:52,159 --> 01:54:53,920
development thank you

2773
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:55,280
thank you so much

2774
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:57,840
yeah and agree and also we have to find

2775
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:00,400
how these documents

2776
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:03,520
support initiatives and are helpful

2777
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:05,920
if if helpful i think people will be

2778
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:08,080
willing to contribute effort

2779
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:11,119
so well any comment question we can open

2780
01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:13,199

2781
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:15,199
