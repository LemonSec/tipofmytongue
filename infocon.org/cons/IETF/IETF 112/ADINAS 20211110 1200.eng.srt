we have all in personal discussions so

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,879
we talk about technology and not about

61
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,200
personal issues

62
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,120
we all have the goal to devise solutions

63
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,040
for the global internet

64
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,800
so we have to keep that in mind that we

65
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
all have a common goal

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,680

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,360
and understand the drafts and the

71
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,120
presentations before the meeting starts

72
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,280

i

104
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,479
clicked on the mic by mistake when

105
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,919
switching screens

106
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,960
so thank you very much bob and and yes

107
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,800
uh you will also help with the minutes

108
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,680
hopefully when he is able to join but

109
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,280
the more the merry

110
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,679
makes like

111
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,919
so this is the agenda that we have for

112
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,840
today we're going to spend a few minutes

113
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
just because this is the first meeting

114
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,680
as a working group to to remind you

115
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,600
about the status uh where we are what

116
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,639
are our objectives

117
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,880
then we're going to move to the status

118
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,039
update from other seos

119
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,240
starting from the

120
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,600
wba

121
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,080
moving on to 802.1 802.11.

122
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,639
uh then we're going to start talking

123
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,960
about the the two drafts that we have at

124
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,360
hand the first one being the randomized

125
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,280
and changing mac addresses use cases by

126
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,400
jerome

127
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,240
and then the mac address randomization

128
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,199
amelia will present

129
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,800
and then we're going to talk about next

130
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,600
steps any questions or comments on the

131
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,600
agenda

132
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,400
okay here and now

133
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,919
we can move to the next slide please

134
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,400
so as a reminder

135
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,360
we

136
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,720
so far had been meeting as a as a buff

137
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,520
and the purpose of the of the buff

138
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,840
was said to to inform the ietf community

139
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,120
about the latest mac address

140
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,759
randomization activities and purposes

141
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,000
uh we presented also the network and

142
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,400
application uh service related issues

143
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,319
that were uh related to to this mac

144
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,160
address randomization

145
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,880
and um the idea was to identify whether

146
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,440
any actions were required at the ietf

147
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,199
and we identified

148
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,600
at least these three which is the

149
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,160
coordination with other ratios

150
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,520
documentation of

151
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,479
use cases and identification of existing

152
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,080
solutions and gaps

153
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,039
and therefore we got charter

154
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,840
next slide please

155
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,919
so

156
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,280
knowing that

157
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,600
the mac address randomization is here

158
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,360
and now

159
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,759
and that for some

160
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,080
network services the device identity is

161
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,759
important

162
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,639
we

163
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,880
want to understand and see

164
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,840
how to

165
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,560
still provide those services

166
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
without necessarily

167
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,919
endangering the the privacy

168
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,479
features that were uh addressed by the

169
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,880
market randomization

170
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,000
so

171
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,160
the idea here is mainly to explore the

172
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
fact that

173
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,120
so far many applications uh make an

174
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,360
implicit assumption that the device uh

175
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,360
uses an i802 layer 2 identification also

176
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,120
known as mac address that is permanent

177
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,639
and unique and this is no longer the

178
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,160
case

179
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,280
so

180
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,680
we will then work on identifying these

181
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,280
scenarios

182
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,840
and and see what is the effect of rcm on

183
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,880
them

184
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,840
then we will also analyze uh identifiers

185
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,240
that can be used beyond the mac address

186
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,120
for

187
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
network uh to provide the seamless

188
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,720
service and

189
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,039
also the scenarios where the identity is

190
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,039
actually not required that maybe we are

191
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
misusing

192
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,319
the mac address

193
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,800
next slide please

194
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,840
we are chartered to work on a bcp

195
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,680
that will recommend means to reduce the

196
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,360
impact of rcm

197
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,160
on use cases while of course still

198
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,000
ensuring the privacy achieved with rcm

199
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
is not compromised

200
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,759
and also we are chartered to work

201
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,560
together with other ietf working groups

202
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,199
which have identified many like dhc or

203
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
interior

204
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,720
as well as liaise with other

205
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,639
seos

206
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,120
and also we have identified a triple

207
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,280
eight of two the wireless broadband

208
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,440
alliance wba

209
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,679
and we have already started some some

210
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,839
discussions with them that will be

211
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,200
reported

212
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,519
right after this

213
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,559
so

214
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,440
as far as deliverables we have

215
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
the documents about the current status

216
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,320
or our current state of affairs

217
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,839
and informal use

218
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,360
information also our use case and

219
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,760
identity requirements document and an

220
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,440
information on mac address randomization

221
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,800
currents

222
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,640
state of affairs document then we have

223
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,080
two drafts that

224
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,160
try to respond to those so we'll talk

225
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,399
about them and

226
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,760
the idea is to

227
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,959
adopt them by the working group and also

228
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,480
we have a

229
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,959
will be working later on on a bcp

230
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,399
so

231
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,920
i think that's it

232
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,399
next slide

233
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,200
yes

234
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,040
so

235
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,080
we can move

236
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,959
uh

237
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,120
next on the agenda

238
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,920
to

239
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,160
tim

240
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,079
tim do you want

241
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,040
is my audio okay this time

242
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,519
yes it's a good thanks

243
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,000
excellent thank you

244
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,600
so

245
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,880
just as an overview we have in the wba a

246
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,839
wi-fi devices identification project

247
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,560
that we set up back in

248
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,079
january

249
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,440
to look at this issue of randomized and

250
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,279
changing mac addresses and what the

251
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,320
effects of this were and what we could

252
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,760
do about it

253
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,800
um

254
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,920
insofar as it affects various services

255
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,839
that wba members may be providing

256
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,920
um could i have the first slide please

257
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,200
so the objectives are

258
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,240
as stated here to to look at the mac

259
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,360
address

260
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,000
and find alternatives

261
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,440
uh to identify typically users but

262
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,000
sometimes devices

263
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,880
and

264
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,560
indeed look at whether

265
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,040
identification is actually necessary in

266
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,839
some cases

267
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,880
so

268
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,240
uh

269
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,800
the next objective analyze and look at

270
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,200
the currently available solutions that's

271
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,360
because we're a high level organization

272
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,720
that's largely what we've been doing

273
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,880
then of course liaise with other

274
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
standards organizations such as

275
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,440
yourselves

276
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,760
and then at the end of it all explain

277
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,279
and recommend technologies that

278
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,279
are ideally are already present

279
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,959
so that people who are using mac

280
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,519
addresses at the moment can

281
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,519
move on to something more appropriate

282
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,920
so next slide please

283
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
so we've

284
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,880
we've looked at a number of use cases

285
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,000
for where the mac address is

286
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,800
currently or has been used as a

287
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,880
long-term identifier

288
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,600
and where this is going to cause issues

289
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,760
with service and we've previously

290
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,279
liaised the document with you

291
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,680
covering those

292
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,000
yeah following on from that we we've

293
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,880
gone through those use cases and looked

294
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,160
at the various requirements

295
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,959
that

296
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,480
they present um in terms of you know the

297
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,800
uniqueness of the identity

298
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,800
identity it's its scope and duration

299
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,720
now

300
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,480
typically

301
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,399
although macs are being used the

302
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,839
uniqueness

303
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,720
is

304
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,760
really for the user within a particular

305
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,000
network

306
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,320
and the duration

307
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,200
very often is long term these are

308
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,000
people who've signed up for a service

309
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,240
and it's about identifying the user of

310
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,800
the service

311
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,440
uh we've also spent quite some time

312
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,200
discussing the

313
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,360
issues of privacy and consent for

314
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,920
identification

315
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,120
and what happens if the user doesn't

316
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,760
want to consent to use some

317
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,760
alternative form of identification

318
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,800
so having

319
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,519
looked at all those requirements

320
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,440
and

321
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,959
really

322
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,360
the requirements covering everything

323
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,040
from

324
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,639
we just want to identify a device for a

325
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,600
session right through to we want to

326
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,760
identify

327
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,440
a person

328
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,279
and each of their devices for

329
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,000
potentially years

330
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,760
so

331
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,680
it's not really anything ruled out

332
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,800
so having looked at those requirements

333
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,560
we've moved on to examining the

334
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,560
obvious existing solutions

335
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,519
clearly starting with

336
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,360
the 802.1x

337
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,120
based authentications wpa2 or 3

338
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,160
enterprise passpoint and over the top of

339
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,480
that open roaming

340
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,880
we've also looked at the

341
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,519
private pre-shared key

342
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,079
device fingerprinting and other

343
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,360
proprietary external identification

344
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,120
such as where

345
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,040
an app or a website is used to identify

346
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,360
the user and that's then communicated

347
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,560
back to the wi-fi network

348
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,079
to

349
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,279
either allow access to certain

350
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,160
resources or maybe to

351
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,079
set up

352
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,959
perhaps something like a particular quas

353
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,279
level

354
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,680
and of course the the other alternative

355
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,800
which is

356
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,560
doing nothing there will be some

357
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,199
situations in which

358
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,360
not doing anything and just leaving them

359
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,040
act to change

360
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,600
is a perfectly viable option and we

361
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,639
wanted to understand what the effects

362
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,440
of that would be

363
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,440
because of a lack of

364
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,880
time and expertise we haven't really

365
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,480
looked at wi-fi easy connect

366
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,480
or

367
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,399
802.1 ar

368
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,320
which which we don't understand but

369
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
looked interesting

370
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,639
um

371
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,839
as a result of examining the solutions

372
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,120
there are some things that

373
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,560
they don't

374
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,759
really provide function

375
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,959
they don't really provide the

376
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,360
functionality that we previously had

377
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,959
available from an unchanging mac

378
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,480
and

379
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,199
we're currently discussing

380
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,839
what the implications of that are

381
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,399
next slide please

382
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,079
so um

383
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,240
the idea is that

384
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,720
having looked at all these solutions and

385
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,079
and what they can offer

386
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,920
uh that we will want to make

387
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,199
recommendations for each

388
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,360
type of network so in in this case the

389
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,240
type of network will be things like

390
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,560
hospitality or in-home

391
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
or enterprise

392
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,720
um

393
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,120
public networks that are either paid or

394
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,959
or free

395
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,079
so

396
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,199
those are the

397
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,199
network types that we're talking about

398
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,360
here

399
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,959
and we've

400
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,279
in the process at the moment of looking

401
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,199
at each of those

402
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,320
currently available solutions

403
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,199
and suggesting which of them might be

404
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,119
preferable for which network type um

405
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,919
alongside that yeah

406
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,559
we find that obviously not not

407
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,880
everything that we used to do with mac

408
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,120
is covered

409
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,839
the main things

410
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,400
we find i think are

411
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,640
wi-fi network diagnostics such as yeah

412
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,919
is used for the home or enterprise

413
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,160
where devices are unable to connect

414
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,880
and not that they simply can't

415
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,600
associate but maybe they're not even

416
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,160
attempting to connect

417
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,520
we we have no i no means of identifying

418
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,200
that that device

419
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,160
belongs to the network

420
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,960
and perhaps should have been attempting

421
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,400
um

422
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,880
but equally we don't want to be connect

423
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,360
collecting information about devices

424
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,440
that have no relationship with the

425
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,919
network

426
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,799
and shouldn't be connecting anyway and

427
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,039
it's it's very hard to distinguish those

428
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,720
two

429
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,120
and and without the mac currently we

430
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,160
don't have a solution for that

431
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,360
um

432
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,840
there are also issues where

433
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,120
because the mac is based on

434
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,080
the randomized mac is peculiar to an

435
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,879
ssid

436
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,440
we may have a service provider with

437
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,240
multiple ssids

438
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,400
and the example here you know

439
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,240
there's one for the hotel

440
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,000
and one for the cons conference rooms so

441
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,919
a delegate at the conference staying in

442
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,720
the hotel may have to deal with

443
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,880
two different

444
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,840
ssids

445
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,080
and their device will appear from the

446
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,320
point of view of the mac to be

447
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,200
two different devices

448
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,120
so that that issue needs to be

449
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,280
considered

450
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,320
uh

451
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,120
there's also the issues of lawful

452
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,120
intercept and obtaining

453
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,679
icrs

454
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,360
sorry

455
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,439
that's internet connection records

456
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,559
the law enforcement may come to an

457
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,640
operator and say

458
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,240
we need the connection records

459
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,000
and

460
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,400
currently they may use a mac address to

461
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,559
specify the device that they want to do

462
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,760
that for

463
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,000
obviously that's going to be completely

464
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,640
unviable

465
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,360
but the legal obligation to provide

466
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,360
those records is still going to remain

467
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,039
there's a just just a brief outline as

468
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,440
far as we've got at the moment of some

469
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,919
of the things that

470
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,080
we don't feel are covered

471
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,159
um

472
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,000
and the next step um

473
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,440
follows on from item five here

474
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,840
is to

475
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,080
uh

476
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,159
so we're going to make recommendations

477
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,720
about the solutions and the way we've

478
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,919
written them at the moment

479
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,000
is looking at the solutions and what

480
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,760
they can do

481
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,679
we're now in the process of looking at

482
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,280
the network

483
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,120
types and

484
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,960
assigning the solutions to them

485
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,200
all of this is going to be bundled up

486
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,880
into our white paper

487
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,280
which

488
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,600
is supposed to be completed by the end

489
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,159
of this year

490
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,080
will be published at the end of the

491
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,559
process

492
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,840
so

493
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,480
i won't bother the next slide is just a

494
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,400
thank you all very much for listening

495
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,199
so that's it from me thanks

496
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,840
thanks tim

497
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,199
are there any questions for tim

498
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,720
stevens

499
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,640
if the wb has come up any

500
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,440
um

501
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,760
proposed solutions it sounds like the

502
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,720
mac address is still the the

503
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
the best way

504
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,600
have you thought of using uuid and

505
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,280
the ie

506
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,799
information

507
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,799
or something like that uh we

508
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,400
certainly

509
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,919
we're not considering that the mac

510
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,600
address is the best way

511
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,640
most of the solutions

512
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,200
at the moment for

513
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,640
larger more public networks hospitality

514
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,000
enterprise

515
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,280
um

516
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,120
we're suggesting that

517
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,080
one of the 802.1x based

518
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,679
methods is the way to go

519
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,960
for home networks there may be some

520
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,039
applicability for

521
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,880
ppsk or even device fingerprinting but

522
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,799
neither of those are standards and we

523
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,080
don't really like

524
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,640
recommending

525
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,440
non-standardized solutions

526
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,520
okay uh

527
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,960
as regards

528
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,120
the other items here there are things we

529
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,280
haven't covered and that's mostly

530
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,159
because we don't have the knowledge at

531
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,799
the moment to cover them

532
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,240
so will this uh white paper be available

533
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,960
to the public or shared with the ietf at

534
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,280
least

535
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,760
typically the executive summary is made

536
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,720
public and the white paper itself is

537
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,840
available to members and liaisons

538
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,880
so

539
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,000
it could well be shared with the ietf

540
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,880
but

541
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,360
we will have to discuss the implications

542
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,799
of that if the ietf were to be making it

543
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,200
public

544
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,000
okay thank you

545
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,240
all right so uh

546
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,480
i talking with you uh thanks tina for

547
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,760
that uh

548
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,840
question and indeed uh as you can see

549
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,159
there's quite a bit of overlap on the on

550
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,880
the use cases identification but this is

551
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,400
uh rather a good thing

552
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,200
uh seeing that wba has taken a good

553
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,000
quick start at the at the issue so the

554
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,240
point is here not to reinvent the wheel

555
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,880
but rather to to work together to make

556
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,640
sure that uh

557
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,720
we consider the use cases that have

558
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,840
already been uh identified by wba we can

559
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,440
extend them of course

560
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,919
in medina's uh to other use cases that

561
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,159
may not be

562
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,120
interesting for for wba and also of

563
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,320
course uh regarding the the solutions

564
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,279
we are uh going to talk to uh ieee 802

565
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,080
or uh other etf groups

566
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,880
to make sure that uh that the solutions

567
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,799
are are also considered

568
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:19,600
so

569
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,480
yes i guess to work together with wba

570
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,360
and uh as tim mentioned that we have the

571
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,360
the means to to also work with the

572
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,279
liaisons to make it official if ever we

573
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,360
need to get access to some documents or

574
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,520
we can reference them and put

575
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,200
information in our draft or something

576
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,279
like that but but for sure we want to

577
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,880
share information and make sure that we

578
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,919
work

579
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,720
together with them

580
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,440
yep super thank you

581
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,960
thank you very much tim

582
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,960
so next in line is

583
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,400
glenn

584
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,559
and

585
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,320
if you want to share preloaded slides

586
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,840
clip that's the preferred way

587
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,880
uh

588
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,039
do you want me to share the slides or or

589
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,200
can you do that what's the

590
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
if you if you click on the on the icon

591
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,520
that is

592
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,080
right next to the to the hand on top it

593
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
says share preloaded slides

594
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,600
you should see your slides there and

595
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,400
then you can you can control the

596
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,320
the presentation

597
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,679
uh

598
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,600
share pre-loaded

599
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,360
under meeting materials is that where it

600
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,600
is no no no uh below your name

601
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,279
below my name

602
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,720
on the left

603
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,919
top

604
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,000
you have a hand to join the queue and

605
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,960
then next item i only see ask to share

606
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,279
screen ask to share slides and join

607
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,360
queue

608
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,440
slides and then you will see the list of

609
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,440
slides that are being reloaded

610
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,919
okay okay ask to share slides and then

611
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,400
uh oh i see so then the eight or two

612
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,279
dot one update is that uh

613
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,240
great

614
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,480
you're wrong

615
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,400
okay is that uh

616
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,039
can you see the slides i'm

617
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,240
i'm i'm not so familiar with this

618
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,080
yes we see

619
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,080
advanced high resolution

620
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,960
okay

621
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,880
okay very good okay so thank you very

622
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,520
much uh for um for giving me the time to

623
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,640
present here um my name is glenn parsons

624
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,520
i'm affiliated with erickson uh and uh

625
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,559
i'm also the uh the chair of the 802.1

626
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,919
working group within within ieee

627
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:40,799
but

628
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,760
i

629
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,760
as the chair because i'm the chair i

630
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,919
have to give this disclaimer that that

631
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,640
this is a personal presentation um and

632
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,919
is not a formal presentation of ieee or

633
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,679
the eight or two dot working 8301

634
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,760
working group uh because they have not

635
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,279
uh approved um this presentation uh but

636
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,480
be that as it may this is my view of uh

637
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,559
the situation um in in 802.1

638
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,919
uh and just to give you a quick

639
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,200
background of of what 802.1 is within

640
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,000
within ieee um we're the uh the

641
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,080
architecture and bridging

642
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,159
uh working group uh traditionally called

643
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,399
the higher layer interface we've been

644
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,640
around since the beginning

645
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,440
of the 802

646
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,039
standards committee

647
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,279
and uh and we are part of the uh the

648
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,840
landman sanders committee along with

649
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,039
11.3.15. and so on um and uh we

650
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,000
um operate at what what we call the the

651
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,720
higher layer of uh of the data link

652
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,559
layer here which um

653
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,200
is effectively the the higher layer of

654
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,120
uh of the the mac um and and that's the

655
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,840
uh the protocols that we deal with

656
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,840
this is the organization on the right of

657
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,960
the um

658
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,679
of the 802.1 working group most of our

659
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,200
work right now is focused on

660
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,159
time-sensitive networking um however we

661
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,360
do have uh work on uh security which

662
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,559
i'll mention uh and we do have uh

663
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,480
architecture work that has happened in

664
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,760
the past

665
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,559
and we'll start up again and we

666
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,880
currently have a study project underway

667
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,279
uh in our industry connections activity

668
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,799
uh nendica

669
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,240
so just uh

670
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,760
i guess a brief

671
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,320
background if you will on the the

672
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,080
reference model and this is a reference

673
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,159
model that is uh defined within uh ieee

674
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,640
standard 802 which is our base overview

675
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,320
and architecture

676
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,679
standard and

677
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,520
and this defines

678
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,640
the

679
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,360
interfaces between the different layers

680
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,799
um uh

681
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,600
with the terminology of access points

682
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,799
and so you see

683
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,919
physical access points and uh mac access

684
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,279
points and and so on and the uh the mac

685
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,960
address uh is defined at the uh the mac

686
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,559
um address point and is common uh to all

687
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,000
uh 802

688
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,799
um technologies

689
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,039
so the mac address as i'm sure you know

690
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,399
is a 48 or 64-bit number used to

691
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,000
identify the source

692
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,679
and destination um and uh may also be

693
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,880
used as i said as this at this mac sap

694
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,520
that i showed in the previous figure

695
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,559
there are

696
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,799
a number of bits at the beginning of the

697
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,320
mac address

698
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,799
the individual group address identifies

699
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,559
whether it's an individual address which

700
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,240
is the typical case

701
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,760
or a group address which is like a

702
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,840
broadcast address

703
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,640
and then the universal and local bit uh

704
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,080
identifies whether it's universally

705
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,880
administered which means the ieee

706
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,799
registration authority assigns that

707
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,799
number or whether it is

708
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,320
locally administered and locally uh

709
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
locally was originally

710
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,760
not so defined but was recently uh

711
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,240
defined and i'll talk about that uh in a

712
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,279
minute uh you can see that the uh the

713
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,919
way that the address is structured is

714
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:10,960
that

715
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,880
a subset of the address is a so this is

716
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,480
for the universal

717
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,720
addresses a subset of that address is

718
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,279
assigned by the

719
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,360
registration authority the ieee

720
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,159
registration authority uh that currently

721
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,440
assigns addresses in either um large

722
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,240
medium or small depending on how many uh

723
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,039
universal addresses that uh that are

724
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,360
desired uh for the use case so whether

725
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,200
it's you know uh

726
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,320
4 000 or so or up to 16 million per um

727
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,399
per block

728
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,200
so as i had mentioned um

729
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,799
there is some

730
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,559
organization that

731
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,000
has been added

732
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,159
in standard 802

733
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,880
and this was in discussions that

734
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,640
that we had with the registration

735
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,320
authority

736
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,799
that they're concerned that there was an

737
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,080
impending exhaustion of the uh mac

738
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,159
address space uh

739
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,919
mostly due to virtualization uh and the

740
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,360
the view that uh going forward um mac

741
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,080
addresses would no longer be just for a

742
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,080
physical devices as was the original

743
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,120
intent

744
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,880
but there would be many

745
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,880
virtual devices so that a single

746
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,840
physical device could have numerous

747
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,080
virtual instances of

748
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,480
whether of end stations or bridges

749
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,360
um or or other devices within them that

750
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,320
would require mac addresses uh and this

751
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,240
would lead to exhaustion if the

752
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,679
universal space was used and so uh what

753
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,240
was done was uh a more structured use

754
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,000
of the local space

755
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,399
was was defined and so the local space

756
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,200
was previously just whether the local uh

757
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,559
bit was uh was set which is uh is shown

758
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,480
here is the the x bit um and uh what was

759
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,960
done was that uh two additional bits

760
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,760
were identified uh y and z here which

761
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,760
are the next ones in uh to uh identify

762
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,440
an optional

763
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,399
structured local address plan and

764
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,840
there are four

765
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,559
different um different regions

766
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,799
of the local space that this plan has

767
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,000
identified

768
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,880
the first one is an extended local space

769
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,279
and this is using uh an additional

770
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,760
identifier um that the registration

771
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,320
authority uh has offered and so this

772
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,200
this specifically was intended for uh

773
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,240
those virtual environments um and then

774
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,039
there is a standard assigned and so a

775
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,600
standard could assign

776
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,720
reusable addresses for example in uh in

777
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,880
a particular range within the standard

778
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,480
assigned space

779
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,399
administratively assigned

780
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,240
is intended so that the administ this is

781
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,320
where an administration would assign

782
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,960
its uh addresses and the intent here was

783
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,480
that um

784
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,279
any randomization would be within uh

785
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,159
this administratively assigned space

786
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,320
um and then there's reserved and this

787
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,320
was reserved for uh for uh for future um

788
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,840
specification of uh of the local space

789
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,640
so just uh back again on the uh on the

790
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,360
registration authority committee uh and

791
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,760
identifying the the registries and so

792
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,880
this is

793
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,000
uh

794
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,200
the the registry that ieee maintains uh

795
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,279
indicates that uh standard 802 um is

796
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,159
um

797
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,760
the the standard definition for uh what

798
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,640
a mac address is uh number one and for

799
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,440
what the uh different assignments uh

800
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,760
that are given here you see with the the

801
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,880
mal mam and mas and the showing here

802
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,080
this is a 48-bit address and then the

803
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,120
the different

804
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,200
local extensions that um a particular um

805
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,039
you know vendor or manufacturer who

806
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,159
acquires

807
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,279
uh so the mal they would then have 24

808
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,559
bits to assign

809
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,960
um and you know assign it to 16 million

810
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,599
odd different uh devices and so in

811
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,239
addition to um the mac address there are

812
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,119
other identifiers that are also defined

813
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,159
uh in standard 802 uh including the

814
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,918
company id uh oids the urns and and so

815
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,440
forth

816
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,918
so what uh what results here in the in

817
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,159
the unicast space so this is not the

818
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,079
group addresses which is the the first

819
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,199
bit but in the unicash space we have the

820
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,679
the global space which is effectively

821
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,960
the oui

822
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,119
plus an extension and so the oui was the

823
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,560
original term for mal um and so that's

824
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,560
the the global space and then you see

825
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,520
the the other four quadrants uh that i

826
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,239
had just mentioned uh which have uh

827
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,079
which this is an organization an

828
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,719
optional organization of the local space

829
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,480
uh to help uh the administrators um uh

830
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,599
assign

831
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,680
addresses in that space

832
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,440
one of the activities that we have

833
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,520
underway as well uh in 802.1 is uh is a

834
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,800
protocol that would allow administrators

835
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,119
to actually assign

836
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,160
mac addresses to devices on on boot up

837
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,800
and so that's that's another activity uh

838
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,040
we currently have under underway but one

839
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,040
of the things that is recognized in

840
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,200
standard 802 that's indicated here is

841
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,640
that there is a presumed guarantee

842
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,920
um

843
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,359
of uniqueness within uh 802 networks and

844
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,000
that's uniqueness of the mac address and

845
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,040
so this is facilitated with the global

846
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,119
addresses and the globe the universal

847
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,960
space however if the local space is used

848
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,320
it's the uh administrators uh of that

849
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,760
network responsibility to ensure um

850
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,320
uniqueness and if there is

851
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,920
uh not unique addresses there there is a

852
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,079
potential of of disruption of the

853
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,560
network um because of that

854
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,799
um

855
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,839
and so uh and as i had mentioned before

856
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,920
the randomization was intended for the

857
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,720
uh

858
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,040
for the administratively assigned uh

859
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,920
space

860
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,240
uh one thing i'd like to note uh is that

861
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,119
uh

862
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,480
we have uh currently a study underway uh

863
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,800
within um our

864
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,720
industry connections activities on an

865
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,359
evolved link player architecture this is

866
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,079
a precursor to uh the revision of

867
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,680
standard 802.

868
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,839
one of the requirements within ieee is

869
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,480
that standards must be revised every 10

870
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,800
years to remain active

871
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,920
and so the current standard 802

872
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,400
i guess expires in this 10 years at the

873
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,160
end of 2024

874
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,920
and so we'll be starting a revision of

875
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,880
that

876
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,200
early next year most likely

877
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,920
to finish before the end of 2024.

878
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,400
one of the topics within the discussion

879
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,359
is on mac addresses and the specific

880
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,680
mapping of single or multiple mac

881
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,160
addresses to to mseps from an

882
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,960
architecture perspective so that maybe

883
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,560
may be interesting

884
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,720
to this group

885
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,079
going forward

886
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,200
um

887
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,280
so uh so that's the the mac address uh

888
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,520
status just to give you an update now on

889
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,480
some of the

890
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,440
security uh aspects that uh that we're

891
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,839
working on here um i i just gave a

892
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,680
background on um a mac sec which is uh

893
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,119
security uh and privacy um as was noted

894
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,839
in the previous presentation uh we also

895
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,160
um have standards on uh port

896
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,800
authentication which is dot one uh x and

897
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,760
um

898
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,920
uh secure id uh which is dot one a r uh

899
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,280
these have finished um some time ago and

900
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,480
uh are are both widely used um

901
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,320
but i can provide a further update on

902
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,240
those at a future time if that's uh

903
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,880
desired but i wanted to as a highlight

904
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,359
on the the max act because we have a

905
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,680
project underway on this and and privacy

906
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,000
itself is uh relevant for this

907
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,880
discussion um because what we had done

908
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,839
in in 802 in this um

909
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,680
standalone 802e document is specify a

910
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,359
threat model uh for all 802 technologies

911
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,280
against privacy

912
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,320
um

913
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,680
and the

914
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,040
the point is

915
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,480
is uh what are the threats uh and and

916
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,599
how uh can they be mitigated how can we

917
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,960
protect um against them and so this is a

918
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,720
intended as a consistent approach for

919
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,640
all eight or two developers and so it's

920
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,960
uh it's a worthwhile background

921
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,240
information on the threat model uh so on

922
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,680
on mac sec itself uh that is intended as

923
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,960
um

924
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,000
as encryption so data uh data protection

925
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,760
um and uh of course uh counters to uh

926
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,920
some uh man in the middle attacks that

927
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,040
that had been identified some time ago

928
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,480
but um

929
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,040
the the point is is that uh with the new

930
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,079
project that we currently have underway

931
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,680
uh which is mack privacy protection

932
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,760
this uh is specifying um enhancements to

933
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,640
mac security that um

934
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,839
uh

935
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,960
reduces uh the ability for

936
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,680
uh observers to uh to

937
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,720
um

938
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,240
information uh

939
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,240
infer information about a particular

940
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,280
stream uh based on the size uh and the

941
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,760
user's identity and so the way that it

942
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,000
does that is that it encapsulates uh the

943
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,440
entire frame

944
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,200
uh including the the mac addresses um

945
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,760
and and pads the data out and so that

946
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
for example uh you would have a

947
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,960
consistent steady stream of traffic from

948
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,119
the user to an endpoint

949
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,920
no matter what's been being transmitted

950
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,680
um so that's an activity that's

951
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,000
currently underway and just as a and as

952
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,640
an example this is um a diagram of the

953
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,599
the

954
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,640
uh what that uh user frame um

955
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,920
encapsulation would be in this uh maxsec

956
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,240
privacy frame where you see that

957
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,160
it's first encoded you're encoding the

958
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,280
whole frame and adding a a special uh

959
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,880
one-time um

960
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,160
uh new uh essay uh mac address to the

961
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,480
front uh and then uh so that's the

962
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,400
privacy step and then encrypting the

963
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,920
whole thing uh and so uh so this allows

964
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,040
um

965
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,000
uh the both a confidentiality and a

966
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,119
protection um hiding the user's mac

967
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,760
address as well as the original frame

968
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,040
sizes um uh from everyone from the uh

969
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,920
from where this is encrypted uh to the

970
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,000
uh to the endpoint where it's uh where

971
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,440
it's decrypted

972
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,400
um and so uh because and the reason that

973
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,640
this was done is that uh there's

974
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,440
actually solutions to do this already uh

975
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,040
but it was uh uh we we had um

976
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,319
some uh some input that uh standard

977
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,359
based common inter operable uh approach

978
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,520
to this uh was desired and so we're

979
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,760
about um halfway through this project

980
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,079
and expecting to go to the final ballot

981
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,599
on this um

982
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,760
uh early uh early next year

983
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,040
so uh

984
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,880
that's all that i had to uh to summarize

985
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,960
happy to take some questions uh and this

986
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,440
is a a summary of some

987
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,960
some additional information if you want

988
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
to find out about the the dot one

989
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,880
working group and the work underway and

990
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,960
either nandica that i mentioned or the

991
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,760
security group um the 802.1 standards

992
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,079
are freely available um through the uh

993
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,400
the get program on explore uh so you can

994
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,200
just link to them here um and then there

995
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,280
are some tutorials uh some additional

996
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,560
technical tutorials whether it's on tsn

997
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,839
or the local mac address concept or uh

998
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,400
802.1 bridging itself and then i have a

999
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,960
link from the the rack tutorial on this

1000
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,280
as well so thank you very much for the

1001
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,520
time

1002
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,920
thank you very much glenn are there any

1003
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,040
questions for glenn

1004
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,440
michael

1005
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,640
um this is uh really great really great

1006
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,920
um

1007
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,359
one of the things that i observe as we

1008
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,960
move to people using randomized

1009
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,760
addresses is of course is that they um

1010
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,000
no longer many cases need any uh ieee

1011
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
assigned space

1012
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,560
um so that seems to happen on the one

1013
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,000
hand for a lot of

1014
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,839
consumer type devices

1015
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,400
um a group that i'm involved with in the

1016
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,560
iot security

1017
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,599
foundation um actually we would like the

1018
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,599
other way we would like to try we would

1019
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,760
like for industrial uses

1020
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,920
uh we'd really like to have

1021
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,920
um more clear identities or iot devices

1022
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,319
um and specifically um what we're

1023
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,599
wondering is

1024
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,160
uh you know with the ieee ever

1025
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,839
going to a situation where they would

1026
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,040
issue

1027
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,160
uh cider like certificates saying that

1028
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,160
this manufacturer owns this particular

1029
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,839
address space and that would allow them

1030
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,560
to issue certificates with mac addresses

1031
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,440
in them

1032
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,480
as the i as the mostly industrial iot

1033
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,480
device identity

1034
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,240
um so it's sort of the other direction

1035
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,319
to more strongly strong identities for

1036
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,440
certain

1037
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,760
situations rather than the weaker ones

1038
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,079
we have

1039
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,520
so i think what you're talking about is

1040
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,520
what we have in dot one ar which is our

1041
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,079
secure device identity and so that that

1042
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,960
is a mechanism that um defines how

1043
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,200
authentication credentials dev ids is

1044
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,960
what we call them uh and how they're

1045
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,800
cryptographically bound to devices to

1046
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,119
support this identity um right so that's

1047
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,680
what we do have is that what you were

1048
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,000
well we would be using one ars the

1049
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,800
problem is what is the identity that's

1050
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,640
being asserted because the only thing we

1051
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,480
can see over the network is the mac

1052
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,640
address and so we would really like it

1053
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,400
if there was a trust path up to the ieee

1054
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,440
that allowed us to validate uh that you

1055
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,440
know a particular oui was assigned to

1056
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,520
particular vendor and that that vendor

1057
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,280
had issued a certificate and this is

1058
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,920
kind of the opposite of of randomized

1059
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,760
mac address but what we observe is that

1060
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,680
for certain things we really want to you

1061
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,400
go away from user specific um

1062
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,640
identifiable things but for other

1063
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,880
devices we actually want to go the other

1064
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,720
direction we want a stronger uh

1065
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,720
connection to the uh device identity um

1066
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,480
rather than weaker

1067
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,240
right okay so okay so you're looking

1068
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,680
specifically

1069
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,119
and you're looking for the trust model

1070
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,359
to an administrator or ieee because that

1071
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:42,880
one ar is kind of the user to the

1072
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,560
manufacturer so that's that's right you

1073
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,720
know exactly right we want so we want

1074
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,480
user to to through ie to manufacture uh

1075
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,640
kind of stuff all right so so what we're

1076
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,400
what we're working on which i didn't uh

1077
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,119
highlight here uh a protocol called one

1078
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,640
cq

1079
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,520
is mac address assignment and and that

1080
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,960
is um

1081
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,760
one of the options within that is uh is

1082
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,480
a trust relationship on that assignment

1083
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,359
um but but this isn't it's not

1084
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,599
i guess it's not decided yet whether

1085
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,330
ieee would be one of the trusted um

1086
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:17,680
[Music]

1087
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,480
assigners uh the the original intention

1088
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,839
would be that that would be an

1089
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,560
administration and so that uh within an

1090
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,319
administration and an administration i

1091
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:27,359
mean if you're talking industrial

1092
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,119
networks it could be like a factory i

1093
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,400
suppose and now within that factory uh

1094
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,800
there would be uh a trusted assignment

1095
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,200
of mac addresses

1096
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,640
yeah they're not confident to do that

1097
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,760
and they don't have the ability to

1098
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,359
install the certificate

1099
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,599
uh before the device is onboarded but

1100
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,599
the but part of this is also is to

1101
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,400
provide some anchor for all of the the

1102
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,000
nice security and the privacy

1103
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,160
enhancements that you did provide

1104
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,079
and so that they all would look the same

1105
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,319
at layer at a layer two we would do all

1106
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,000
our layers to security

1107
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,560
and we would hide we would hide the real

1108
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,880
real identities in some cases uh but

1109
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,720
without a strong anchor

1110
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,960
um well we can't you know we can't do

1111
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,680
that security randomly right

1112
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,200
right well so i mean i mean that is a

1113
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,319
good point um i mean which is pushes for

1114
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,960
that done on uh on a higher level and

1115
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,560
and i can take that back to the group

1116
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,720
and see if that that's an ecosystem that

1117
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,280
is uh that we'd like to uh encourage to

1118
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,359
be created within ieee i mean that would

1119
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,680
be a registration authority a piece but

1120
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,599
um we can look at that because i mean

1121
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,760
what we have the focusing on has been

1122
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,520
the protocols which i've been talking

1123
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,839
about like with ar and cq and such

1124
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,520
great so thank you very much glenn

1125
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,960
okay thank you

1126
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,880
we need to move on to the next presenter

1127
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,480
now

1128
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,319
that was very very good

1129
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,200
um

1130
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,880
next in line is

1131
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,640
jerome

1132
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,160
hi jerome

1133
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,839
alright good morning let me try to

1134
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:02,078
i should be able to share the slides

1135
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,040
all right

1136
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,280
so thank you everyone let me try to send

1137
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,839
my video and if it uh crashes i'll

1138
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:17,440
i'll stop all right so um thank you uh

1139
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,040
glenn for this presentation and and

1140
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,280
following on his lead i should say that

1141
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,480
this is also

1142
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,280
a personal view as a part i see active

1143
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,119
participant in these two groups not an

1144
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,440
official liaison or anything like that

1145
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,880
um so what i wanted to do here is to

1146
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,960
give you uh with juan carlos a quick

1147
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,440
update on what's going on in the 802.11

1148
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,280
that some people call wi-fi right but

1149
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,760
it's not what 802.11

1150
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,240
calls itself um in that context of our

1151
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,720
cm and this is this group so

1152
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,800
we started in that

1153
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,319
environment to

1154
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,400
observe you know that devices as we

1155
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,160
discussed at the beginning uh chair the

1156
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,920
mac address and they tend to rotate the

1157
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,000
mac address before connecting to one

1158
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,480
access point um and also they more and

1159
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,640
more use randomized mac addresses when

1160
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,000
they connect to an access point with

1161
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,800
more or less stability um so that idea

1162
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,880
has been present along with the idea of

1163
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,440
privacy for for a while um and in the um

1164
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,200
year 2018

1165
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,200
that practice of randomized mac address

1166
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,200
has been observed and studied a little

1167
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,200
bit in the context of a document called

1168
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,880
8-11 aq

1169
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,240
which is like many of the other

1170
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,760
amendments you know improvements to the

1171
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,359
standard that are made every now and

1172
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:26,880
then and then integrated later in the

1173
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,680
standard and what a211aq

1174
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,720
says is that you can use this randomized

1175
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,839
mac address you know there is no

1176
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,839
obligation to use the burned in mac

1177
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,280
address in your device if you're not

1178
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,160
associated um but if you are associated

1179
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,880
and what we call you maintain a state

1180
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,880
with an access point you cannot change

1181
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,800
your mac address within that context

1182
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,480
because you would be breaking your state

1183
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,640
so you break the state and then you you

1184
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,839
you restart

1185
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,839
so that was one thing that was looking

1186
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,400
at rcm but at the same time you know

1187
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,079
this idea of privacy nato 2.11 and rcm

1188
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,760
you know was becoming a more important

1189
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,480
issue

1190
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,880
um that drove the creation of two groups

1191
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,359
first um a topic interest group and then

1192
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,200
a study group it's the normal

1193
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,440
progression in the 8011 world where you

1194
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,880
know a group of people are interested in

1195
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,040
a topic that may become

1196
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,839
some work and that was in 2019 and

1197
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:22,240
2020 and then in the end the outcome of

1198
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,880
that study group was the creation of two

1199
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,480
subgroups working test groups um in 1811

1200
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,079
8011 bh and 8.11 bi

1201
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,559
so what bh does

1202
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,040
is to look at enhanced services with

1203
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,359
randomized mac addresses if i want to

1204
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,680
paraphrase what the idea is about is to

1205
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,079
say rcm is happening in 802.11.

1206
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,319
what do we need to do to maintain

1207
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,319
services in that context are there

1208
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:51,839
things that are going to break if

1209
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,559
devices change the mac address

1210
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,800
and of course you know the answer maybe

1211
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,040
no in most cases but there may be some

1212
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,760
cases where yes you know some

1213
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,480
services that were possible before mac

1214
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,720
addresses were randomized and rotating

1215
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,720
would not be possible anymore so the

1216
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,160
goal of 802.11 ambh is to come through

1217
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,760
you know the the use cases where we

1218
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,000
think that maybe services might be

1219
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
broken in the 802.11 sense um by this uh

1220
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
rotation of mac addresses and you'll see

1221
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,599
if we can you know provide some

1222
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,480
recommendation how how to fix that it's

1223
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,359
intended to be a short term uh quote

1224
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,760
quote group uh the expectation is that

1225
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,760
by 2023-ish

1226
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,200
which you know pretty fast in these

1227
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,520
standard groups uh they should come with

1228
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,359
some text you know for you know

1229
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,520
remediation of whatever might be broken

1230
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,960
of course and you know pushing aside and

1231
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,000
listing what we think is not broken um

1232
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,400
as we speak you know we we're um

1233
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,880
we spend quite some time looking at the

1234
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,640
use cases that we should be tackling you

1235
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,920
know what is really broken by uh rcm i

1236
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,480
know in many cases we find that uh some

1237
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,040
services are not in 802.11 you know you

1238
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,520
do additional stuff on top and you just

1239
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,119
write on the fact that you had the mac

1240
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:06,400
address so you use that stuff to

1241
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,720
identify your device but that's nothing

1242
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,640
to do with a2.11 so there are plenty of

1243
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,400
cases that came up initially as

1244
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,640
potential candidates um that we simply

1245
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,319
pushed aside say well that that is not

1246
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,240
an eight to 11 function you just happen

1247
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,839
to take the opportunity of using the mac

1248
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:22,160
to identify a machine or even worse a

1249
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,200
user

1250
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,640
and you think the mac is a good way of

1251
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,960
doing that and it's not uh so plenty of

1252
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,319
things are left aside and this is i

1253
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,559
think important for us in madinas

1254
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,800
because in particular anything which is

1255
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,000
above 80.11 on the mac layer

1256
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,559
is not necessarily something that 8.11

1257
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,079
needs to solve you know we're not

1258
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,359
dealing with dhcp dns whatever

1259
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,200
so that is something i think important

1260
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,319
for our group here to to keep following

1261
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,960
so we we have a good view now on what

1262
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,880
use cases are probably broken and you

1263
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,119
see them at the top um most of the time

1264
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,559
they are about things where you did

1265
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,640
establish your states um and for which

1266
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,559
that state has consequence in terms of

1267
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,880
service uh even if they are

1268
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,440
only related to 8011 and not directly

1269
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,760
related to 8011 for example

1270
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,839
i.t support and troubleshooting um you

1271
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,760
know you place a

1272
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,160
a a call and then the service breaks at

1273
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,160
some level you call it support and say

1274
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,000
well phone was not working yesterday and

1275
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,599
they asked you okay what's your machine

1276
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,000
ip about i don't know it was yesterday

1277
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,359
what's your mac address i don't know it

1278
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:24,880
was yesterday it changed so you know

1279
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,040
that kind of service is not directly

1280
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,040
a2.11 but we do see why a211

1281
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,880
is involved in that idea of saying well

1282
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,720
if you have a wi-fi service that breaks

1283
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,960
or 8 11 service out breaks

1284
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,559
then you know it may be related to the

1285
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,079
fact that you cannot identify the

1286
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,559
station anymore in the context of 82.11

1287
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,480
that this service breaks

1288
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,720
but you know many others are are not uh

1289
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,920
uh

1290
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,119
involved there

1291
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,559
and there is this other group which is

1292
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,599
eight to eleven bi so bh again is

1293
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,960
surviving you know eight to 11 with rcm

1294
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,000
is anything breaking um 811 bi is more

1295
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,640
around enhanced service with data

1296
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,280
privacy protection so the idea is to say

1297
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,240
wi-fi a2.11 any of these radio

1298
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,800
technologies has this characteristic

1299
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,200
that if you're in range of the signal

1300
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,800
you may be able to observe what's going

1301
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,400
on whereas as we were discussing the

1302
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,880
chat before um if you're on a wire cable

1303
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,520
to um to a switch you know you may be

1304
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,920
able to read what's going on the cable

1305
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,680
from the electromagnetic field it's very

1306
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,440
short range you know but really you know

1307
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,119
you'll see it only if you are on the

1308
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,760
wire or if you are in the switch in it

1309
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,680
to 11 if you're on range of the signal

1310
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,680
you may read stuff and of course the

1311
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,880
question says you know the question

1312
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,240
comes and say well does that you know

1313
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,359
have any impact on privacy

1314
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:42,800
so it's a

1315
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,880
common question that comes is what is

1316
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,280
the relationship between bh and bi so bi

1317
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,559
is not necessarily looking at rcm itself

1318
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,040
although rcm being the reason because of

1319
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,160
privacy concerns that it happened uh you

1320
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,520
know there is kind of a relationship

1321
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,920
that keeps you we keep playing along uh

1322
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,359
uh in these two groups and of course

1323
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,040
sometimes the ball bounces from one

1324
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,960
group to the other uh because it's more

1325
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,800
you know the field of one or the other

1326
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,880
but the group of the goal of bi is to

1327
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,480
say what should we improve in 82.11 uh

1328
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,880
if if there are some things in 2011 that

1329
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,680
have impact on privacy so can we not

1330
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,160
list those is there something we can do

1331
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,319
about it so the goal of bi of course as

1332
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,240
you can see is deeper than bh and

1333
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,559
therefore it's a work stream is intended

1334
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,440
to be longer we expect some publication

1335
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,920
by 2025 two years more than the 811 bh

1336
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,119
so at this stage in the bi group

1337
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,599
what we're trying to do is to list the

1338
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,280
privacy related issues uh with a2011 and

1339
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,880
as you can guess you know there are

1340
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,799
plenty first you know there are some

1341
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:48,640
elements that we reuse from one

1342
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,720
association to the other uh if we want

1343
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,240
to reassociate and come back uh to uh

1344
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,480
an access point to expedite the process

1345
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,760
there are plenty of things that we can

1346
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,839
really say to be recognized by the

1347
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,760
infrastructure and of course this could

1348
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,559
be indications um there are tons of

1349
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,799
things in the frame at the mac layers

1350
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,319
clan was describing it but even that

1351
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:09,520
lower layer

1352
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,160
that we tend to use which are mechanical

1353
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,720
that may be you know usable to identify

1354
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,799
a particular station in the crowd so all

1355
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:18,720
these things are things that we are

1356
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,960
trying to list as we go along at the

1357
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,079
same time

1358
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,280
you know because the problem is not

1359
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,079
entirely new uh there has been quite

1360
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,079
some thoughts already on some privacy

1361
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,440
issues in 8011 so we see also some

1362
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,760
proposal coming up in the group about

1363
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,319
you know fixing some uh points issues

1364
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:37,920
that have been known or identified for a

1365
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,760
while so you know this proposal are you

1366
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,440
know put aside of course you know listed

1367
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,440
and carefully kept so that once we have

1368
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,079
the complete list of use cases we can

1369
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,319
see if those proposals have solved you

1370
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:50,160
know some of these use cases what is

1371
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,920
missing you know emerge everything

1372
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,880
together

1373
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,119
so the goal is that by march 20 22-ish

1374
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,839
we should have a good idea of what the

1375
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:01,680
use cases are and what is broken in

1376
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,599
terms of or what is at risk in terms of

1377
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,599
privacy in eight to eleven

1378
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,079
from there try to get some requirement

1379
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:11,040
and some proposal uh to try to work on

1380
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,119
so you know i think in the term of uh of

1381
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,359
madness uh both of these groups are

1382
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,040
probably very interesting for us to keep

1383
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,680
a liaison with um you know bi because

1384
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,000
you know privacy is the source of the

1385
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,240
cause you know of rcm it seems in the

1386
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,160
first place uh so that's something we

1387
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,400
probably want to keep an eye on and bh

1388
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,480
because it's clear that things that bh

1389
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,880
will fix will probably have an influence

1390
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,319
on what you know the maddiness

1391
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,240
recommendations may be uh because you

1392
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,440
know maybe they'll decide to have a

1393
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,880
stable representation for the mac

1394
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,799
address when you know applicable under

1395
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,319
the controller of the user all that

1396
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,400
stuff in that case you know there may be

1397
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,480
some you know resolution of issues that

1398
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,559
we may be identifying in marines but in

1399
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,480
some other cases they may say oh this is

1400
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,400
not our problem and they may throw their

1401
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,720
things on on our laps and we may need to

1402
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,240
be aware of that to say well maybe then

1403
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,359
we need to tackle that here in the itf

1404
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:00,880
all right let me pause here

1405
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,400
and see if we have any questions or

1406
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,839
feedback on these two groups

1407
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,240
are there any questions uh for jerome on

1408
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,920
802

1409
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,640
11 bi or bh

1410
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,040
stephen

1411
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,960
i yeah i noticed that the what the wba

1412
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,280
is working on is very similar to

1413
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,960
uh the bh so i'm assuming you guys are

1414
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,720
closely collaborating

1415
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,079
on um

1416
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,480
on a general recommendation for this

1417
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,040
work group

1418
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,799
oh thank you steven that's an excellent

1419
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:45,040
point um so so 801bh a2011 in general is

1420
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,640
definitely um talking a lot with wba um

1421
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,040
so so i would say that goals are

1422
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,680
probably not the same in that's in a

1423
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,280
trill of nbh what we're looking at is

1424
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,760
the mechanics of 82.11. you know do you

1425
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,680
break anything if you change the mac you

1426
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,559
know within within a connection uh wpa

1427
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:03,920
uh because it's the wireless broadband

1428
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,680
alliance and i don't want to speak for

1429
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,799
tim

1430
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,680
is looking more about the uh effect of

1431
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,920
rcm on what they're trying to achieve

1432
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,240
with their members so there's definitely

1433
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,040
you know uh in interactions uh and the

1434
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,400
essence because we're looking at the

1435
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,920
same problem and they also talk a lot

1436
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,920
with the wi-fi alliance where there are

1437
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,280
some security groups and some other

1438
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,040
groups you know

1439
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,359
impacted by rcm as well but you know i

1440
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:29,359
would say that although we look at the

1441
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:31,119
same issues our angle is probably

1442
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:33,119
slightly different but yes we talk a lot

1443
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:34,799
yeah

1444
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:37,839
okay thank you

1445
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,680
uh

1446
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,440
buff

1447
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,680
do you want

1448
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,160
you're in the queue you want to

1449
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,960
say something new

1450
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,799
about masquerade

1451
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,240
okay um

1452
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,680
well we've

1453
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,520
fixed uh sorry

1454
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,079
okay okay that should work hear me now

1455
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:17,200
yes yes we can hey bob okay my work in

1456
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,599
unmanned aircraft has the exact opposite

1457
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,680
problem and that is that the identity

1458
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,559
must be known because you're in a a

1459
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:27,359
public space the airspace

1460
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,720
and the

1461
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,920
design is to use the mac address to be

1462
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,880
able to associate the uh the message

1463
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,200
stream from the unmanned aircraft by the

1464
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,200
observer so

1465
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,359
requires two things one that for what we

1466
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:44,000
call technically called an operation or

1467
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,640
generally called a flight must use the

1468
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,680
same mac address for that time but

1469
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,280
actually the problem is on the other

1470
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,280
side the receiver

1471
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,000
application has to get the mac address

1472
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
to be able to associate the messages

1473
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,920
together to able to say what is that

1474
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,559
i'm an aircraft doing and what messages

1475
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,200
are saving and we've been finding that

1476
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,040
on many of the

1477
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,680
the the uh the smartphones

1478
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,400
the

1479
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,680
api

1480
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,559
does not send the mac address up the

1481
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,000
stack

1482
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,480
so the uh we're using uh

1483
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,839
wi-fi beacons i'm using the uh

1484
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:25,760
vendor ie

1485
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,960
what's that 221 i believe uh glenn um

1486
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,000
with a uh pacific uh vendor that that's

1487
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,359
been been

1488
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:35,680
uh i think what's parrot is using their

1489
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,680
sign their uh their vendor id that they

1490
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,359
got

1491
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,359
and so they would associate these

1492
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:44,559
together to make a stream but then the

1493
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:45,680
api

1494
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,799
puts a pseudo mac address up to the

1495
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:52,000
application which then breaks the whole

1496
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,119
intent to be able to link the messages

1497
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,400
together so here is a case where the mac

1498
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,920
address is needed in a broadcast media

1499
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,240
to be able to link messages in an

1500
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,200
environment where privacy is basically

1501
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,760
not allowed up to some level of

1502
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,760
definition of privacy

1503
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,520
so it's it's a slightly different use

1504
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,799
case um just bringing it here uh to

1505
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:18,559
point it out

1506
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:20,640
and you can see it in my draft graph

1507
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,079
ietf grip grid under uh the privacy

1508
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:26,720
section i talk about it

1509
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,079
okay i'll look it up because you know

1510
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,720
it's an interesting case um and and

1511
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,640
you're right on the client side on the

1512
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,760
access point of course it's different

1513
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,680
but on client side there's been a lot of

1514
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,839
effort to try to hide the mac address to

1515
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:40,160
avoid precisely that um you know

1516
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,000
applications would extract the mac

1517
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,920
without the user consent and just send

1518
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,400
it out for you know in tracking of the

1519
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,799
user um so you're describing you know

1520
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,160
that scenario where we are in a point

1521
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,760
where we say well it's important that

1522
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,599
the user has control

1523
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:55,039
but also there are many scenarios where

1524
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,520
the user doesn't know that you know this

1525
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,039
is a problem you know that there would

1526
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:00,880
need to be ask a question but then you

1527
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,640
know there is of course this difficult

1528
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,559
question how many times you ask the user

1529
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,000
about what and do they understand the

1530
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,079
question um so that's one of the things

1531
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:11,359
where where edward bh is is looking into

1532
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:12,720
you know the is there's anything that

1533
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,280
breaks uh but we're looking at the 8011

1534
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,119
side what you're uh seem to be looking

1535
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:19,839
at is more in the application side of

1536
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:21,599
802.11

1537
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,200
so i'm not sure which forum would be

1538
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,039
best for to examine this

1539
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:27,359
but i definitely will look at a document

1540
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:29,200
you're talking about we also have a

1541
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,720
problem with

1542
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,559
the

1543
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:36,079
gps information on the uh smart phones

1544
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:38,319
and that's an fcc issue which doesn't

1545
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:39,920
come here that that we have to know

1546
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,480
where where the device is um the

1547
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,599
receiver is and uh but that that's for

1548
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,920
another conversation not not yeah not

1549
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,119
this one here

1550
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:51,039
that's likely if you close too

1551
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:52,960
okay thank you thank you

1552
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,200
thanks bob um thanks jerome for that

1553
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,319
answer uh amelia

1554
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:00,240
yes hello thank you for this

1555
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,959
presentation

1556
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,039
yes you are

1557
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:06,480
okay very good

1558
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,599
um well so a lot of the um in many of

1559
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:11,119
the updates that we've heard from the

1560
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,760
standards development organizations

1561
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,520
um in this

1562
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,960
section and the problems identified are

1563
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,559
or the use cases

1564
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:22,480
um and challenges

1565
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,079
both in terms of identification and

1566
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:26,640
privacy protection are overlapping

1567
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,520
um

1568
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,559
and so

1569
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,079
um

1570
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:31,839
maybe this is a broader question just

1571
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,200
for jerome

1572
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,160
but

1573
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,359
how do we envisage

1574
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:40,480
moving ahead with identifying the

1575
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,319
correct

1576
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,079
technical circumstances in which to

1577
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:46,000
address which problem

1578
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,760
um

1579
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,680
so do we have uh

1580
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,480
something like a foreseen

1581
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,280
way of saying for instance in in the

1582
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,520
ieee 802.11 tgbi working group that well

1583
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,200
this is a problem that is not suitable

1584
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,880
to be solved here but maybe we should be

1585
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,200
solving it in the ietf and similarly if

1586
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,520
we identify here in modern as a problem

1587
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,480
could we

1588
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,119
is there a way that we could pass that

1589
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:14,880
either down 2.11 or up to wba

1590
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,839
um etc

1591
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,400
yeah thank you emily and of course

1592
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,920
you're in all these groups so so i don't

1593
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,520
know the answer but thank you for

1594
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,039
allowing me to share

1595
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:27,599
our thoughts um yeah i think it's it's

1596
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,760
something which is critical for us here

1597
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,680
and continue doing you know liaison with

1598
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,440
a bhbi and probably dolby and wfa

1599
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,480
because in bh for example we spend a lot

1600
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,200
of time looking at use cases and asking

1601
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,039
is that something that breaks with rcm

1602
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:44,559
is it something that breaks and we care

1603
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:47,200
about and in some time in many cases the

1604
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,200
answer is yes it breaks with rcm but we

1605
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,839
don't care um so it's it's important

1606
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:54,480
that you know as each group lists the

1607
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,200
possible issues uh we keep you know

1608
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,359
sending those exchanges back and forth

1609
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:00,720
and i'm sure that it's at some point

1610
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,799
we'll say well we don't think it's any

1611
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:05,920
one of us to solve you know it's it's um

1612
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:06,960
you know you've been using the mac

1613
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,960
address wrong stop using that

1614
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,039
um but in some cases yeah

1615
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:12,720
my expectations that will be pushing

1616
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,359
ball from one side to the other um so

1617
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:17,119
yeah so yeah i think liaison between

1618
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:18,720
these groups and of course you know many

1619
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:19,920
participants one group are also

1620
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,920
participants of the others

1621
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,000
so i think this is critical if you if we

1622
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,079
don't do that if we work in isolation

1623
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,640
we'll fail

1624
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,760
great

1625
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,000
thanks a lot for that

1626
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,880
answer jerome uh so let's move on then

1627
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,799
to the next item

1628
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:42,000
um after seeing the updates from seos

1629
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,319
now um it's time to talk about the

1630
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,720
drafts that we have uh

1631
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,400
proposed for the group

1632
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,839
and we start with jerome

1633
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:53,920
oh okay okay again

1634
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,200
i don't want to take the mic for

1635
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,039
everybody but okay

1636
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:00,640
let me share the next uh

1637
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,720
slide

1638
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,359
all right

1639
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,720
okay so

1640
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,520
um this is something that uh hopefully

1641
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,680
most of you are aware of you know we've

1642
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,000
been working on this draft for a little

1643
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,799
while

1644
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,920
um

1645
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:22,799
and

1646
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:25,280
so what we're trying to do here is in

1647
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,359
the context of maddinas

1648
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:30,000
we know that uh rcm you know the fact

1649
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,440
that you change the mac address that is

1650
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,440
used to identify a station

1651
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,920
is going to affect services

1652
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,160
and you know if it affects services for

1653
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,079
the station it may affect the user

1654
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:43,200
experience of that station so we try to

1655
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,559
understand what context these deals with

1656
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:48,480
and what is the requirement for that

1657
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,400
kind of of issue

1658
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,119
however we also found that a very common

1659
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:55,440
problem we face when we encounter those

1660
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,760
conversations is vocabulary and you know

1661
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,200
i've seen in the chats and it's a

1662
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,359
typical example of that where you know

1663
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:03,839
we use terms in different contexts

1664
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:05,599
and of course it becomes very difficult

1665
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,599
very soon to understand each other you

1666
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:08,799
know if you say that you know they

1667
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:10,960
should not read my mac address

1668
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,000
they who you know who who is they um you

1669
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,680
know if we if we're not specific into

1670
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,000
what we're defining um

1671
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,440
then it becomes very difficult to make

1672
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,200
progress because we keep redefining

1673
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,880
terms all the time and each person has a

1674
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,480
different term so what this draft does

1675
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,119
first is try to say uh can we define a

1676
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:28,400
little bit better you know the

1677
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,000
environment where we operate so we can

1678
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,920
refer to the same you know kind of

1679
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,480
structure environment when we talk about

1680
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,119
problems and solutions uh in particular

1681
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,440
we reuse what glenn was describing which

1682
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,680
is the 802 e you know and others group

1683
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,240
that you use the terminology of personal

1684
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,400
versus versus managed devices your

1685
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,559
personal device is something which a

1686
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:52,960
device which traffic is directly

1687
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,280
relatable to a single user you know if

1688
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,960
you have your smartphone most of the

1689
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,119
time only you use your smartphone so

1690
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:00,400
whatever traffic comes from that

1691
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,039
smartphone is likely being associated to

1692
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:05,440
you directly and you know personally

1693
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,280
shared service devices and what we call

1694
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,160
managed devices are devices which

1695
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,760
traffic is not necessarily directly

1696
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,079
associated to a person uh typical

1697
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:16,080
example we take you know at the

1698
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,080
infrastructure level is a switch or you

1699
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,080
know an access point in an airport you

1700
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,158
know at some point you may see someone's

1701
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:24,158
traffic there but if you look over time

1702
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:25,679
at the traffic of that access smarter

1703
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:27,839
switch you cannot really link it

1704
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:30,880
directly to one single person

1705
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,198
also on the endpoint standpoint if you

1706
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:34,960
have a you know barcode scanner or

1707
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,120
tablet in a factory where you know you

1708
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,120
enter things about the production

1709
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,679
the person that enters the stuff on the

1710
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:43,920
the information on that device is not

1711
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,000
directly it's not personal information

1712
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,679
that's there no it's only work stuff so

1713
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:50,238
it doesn't identify the the user and

1714
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:52,238
we'll try so to you know make difference

1715
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:54,000
between the user and the device they're

1716
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,319
not the same entities right and then of

1717
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,479
course they who are they that are

1718
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:00,238
looking at these mac addresses and we

1719
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:02,000
may want to protect from and of course

1720
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,679
there are some network functional

1721
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:06,399
entities and that's where 8011 bh comes

1722
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:08,960
in and maybe we come in as well where we

1723
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,799
say you know some devices in the

1724
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:13,520
infrastructure use the mac address just

1725
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,679
to know where to send stuff back and to

1726
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:19,120
know which services is given by by by

1727
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,198
which entity to what other entity so

1728
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:22,960
those are functional entities and of

1729
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,759
course uh changing the mac may have uh

1730
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:27,120
the um

1731
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,560
uh the uh

1732
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,880
some issues um and there are also some

1733
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,120
human related entities and that's where

1734
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,040
probably you know many times we we talk

1735
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,000
about things uh where um you know you

1736
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,920
may have over-the-air observers uh

1737
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,479
observers on the wired uh inside the

1738
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:45,359
network that's the ltlei or x outside of

1739
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:47,359
network utility

1740
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,759
but also some entities managing network

1741
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:51,600
like um you know wireless network

1742
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,920
operators or networks providers so we

1743
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,000
try to list all these possible actors

1744
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,880
and i see in the chat yeah ipv6 uh dhcp

1745
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,159
you know of course we're not saying

1746
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:01,920
we're not defining functions here we are

1747
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,880
listing uh the functions where uh we

1748
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,760
have entities that have an action or an

1749
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,040
interest in in the uh the mac address

1750
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,520
then of course uh moving away from who

1751
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,679
is they uh that's you know one thing

1752
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:17,679
that can be useful we also try to look

1753
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:20,800
at where um the mac address is a problem

1754
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,040
and when it's not and to do that we need

1755
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,120
to define two elements one is what we

1756
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,440
call the trust um you know our can you

1757
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,840
trust everybody uh for example are there

1758
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,199
environments where you and i'll ask the

1759
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:32,159
question again at the end of this

1760
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:33,840
presentation are there environments

1761
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,159
where you you can show your mac address

1762
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:38,560
without the fear that the other

1763
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,360
actors seeing your mac address are going

1764
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,320
to be using that mac address against you

1765
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,120
or to track you or to spy on you um so

1766
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,400
that would be an environment where you

1767
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,480
have a full trust on the other side of a

1768
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,920
spectrum of course you may have zero

1769
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,360
trust you know a place where you say i

1770
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,360
don't trust anybody here and that could

1771
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,880
be you know a public place or something

1772
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,199
like that and there may be in the middle

1773
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:00,640
some gray area that we'll probably need

1774
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,960
to work on which is the selective truss

1775
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,440
where we say well i may need to trust i

1776
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,960
don't know the mac address the access

1777
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,719
point for example

1778
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,719
because i need that thing to make me

1779
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:12,480
connect to the internet without billing

1780
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,400
me every 24 hours every time i change my

1781
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,640
mac but i don't trust you know something

1782
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,199
behind so there may be some areas where

1783
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:22,480
um a selective trust may be set so

1784
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,320
defining which level of trust we're

1785
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,159
seeing for each environment is i think

1786
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:28,000
important and of course defining those

1787
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,880
environments where are we looking at um

1788
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,480
for the mac address problem is important

1789
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,520
because the requirements and the

1790
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,360
exposure might be different

1791
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,199
if you are in your home you know the

1792
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:41,040
exposure is probably different than if

1793
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,880
you are in a busy airport or in a coffee

1794
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,040
shop if you are the managed residential

1795
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,320
setting for example you know these

1796
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,800
places where there is an itc stand for

1797
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,480
you know

1798
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,560
extended living for example

1799
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,000
where there is an i.t system that

1800
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,239
manages the wi-fi they may have you know

1801
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:58,000
view on the need to understand what mac

1802
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,239
address you had that is different than

1803
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:01,840
if you are an enterprise network for

1804
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,239
example any enterprise are you bringing

1805
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:05,600
your own device it's your personal

1806
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,840
device that you also use for work or is

1807
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,280
it an enterprise asset you know they

1808
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,040
give you a laptop and it's their laptop

1809
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,719
you just happen to use it so you know

1810
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:15,280
these environments um have different

1811
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,159
assumptions in terms of not only privacy

1812
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:19,760
but of course you know the relation of

1813
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,840
knowing who is doing what so we try to

1814
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,000
list those um

1815
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,120
to try to to understand when we discuss

1816
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,199
which area are we talking about which

1817
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,280
trust level do we think it matches so

1818
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,880
that we understand what is the effect of

1819
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,000
rcm

1820
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,560
and then in the end uh we try to list

1821
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,400
the requirements that we think

1822
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,280
are a consequence of the usage of rcm

1823
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,040
for the manuals group and here you know

1824
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,679
i'm not going to to read uh all these uh

1825
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:47,199
together because it's uh it's going to

1826
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:48,960
be a bit uh boring but you can read the

1827
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,960
draft yourself

1828
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:53,520
and we will try to list uh the possible

1829
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,760
steps that we could take from that

1830
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,320
assumption in the mighty astro group to

1831
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,560
try to see where our services are

1832
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,800
affected and what recommendations we we

1833
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,040
can we can make um one thing i would

1834
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,440
like to add here uh which is not today

1835
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,800
in the draft and i'll come back on the

1836
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,320
next two slides also on things which are

1837
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:14,640
not um in the draft um is that um iot is

1838
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,880
something we were not observing looking

1839
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,640
at in the draft and final conversation

1840
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,640
we had earlier today here but also some

1841
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,280
feedback we have uh on the list

1842
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,719
it seems that iot might be an

1843
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,719
interesting case to look into you know

1844
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:28,880
either you know as a

1845
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,040
michael was referring to a strong

1846
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,440
identification enterprise but also you

1847
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,199
know what is the effect of iot changing

1848
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:37,679
their mac if it's your iot at home

1849
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,600
so that may be something we may want to

1850
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,000
to envision as well

1851
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,040
so we are today at version three and i

1852
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,280
would say that uh since we posted versus

1853
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,360
three of the draft we uh uh and the

1854
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,760
preparation for for this uh uh meeting

1855
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,920
we receive a ton of feedback so i'd like

1856
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,760
to you know thank everybody who took the

1857
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,920
time and care to read this document and

1858
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,159
provide feedback we'll of course will

1859
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:01,600
respond to it

1860
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,199
but in those

1861
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,199
comments i think there were two things

1862
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:07,520
that i think would be worth bringing to

1863
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,120
the attention of this group maybe to

1864
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,880
discuss you know today and have your

1865
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,320
view on this

1866
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,320
one is a full trust you know this

1867
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,840
environment about full trust i was

1868
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,560
discussing before uh so remember that's

1869
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,800
the environment in the draft we define

1870
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,880
it as the place where you are not

1871
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,840
concerned as a user that the mac of your

1872
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,239
personal device you know your your

1873
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:29,920
smartphone for example

1874
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,640
would be seen by others um you know

1875
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:35,679
there's no threat to you if others see

1876
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,360
you know your mac address and others

1877
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,080
could be services around you know dhep

1878
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,960
and the others whatever but also users

1879
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,880
in range of you you know looking at your

1880
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:45,920
mac

1881
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,640
and being a naive guy living in the us

1882
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,560
where my closest neighbor is about a

1883
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,320
mile and a half away

1884
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,719
i say well probably a home would be a

1885
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:56,560
typical example there

1886
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,159
because i don't really care if my dog

1887
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:00,239
sees my mac address even my wife or my

1888
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:01,760
kids i don't think they are going to

1889
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,679
attack me and all the services where the

1890
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:05,679
mac address is seen to me

1891
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:07,440
is going to be in my house because it's

1892
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,679
going to be my dhcp server is going to

1893
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:13,760
be my wi-fi etc so i tend to see that as

1894
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,520
being an environment where full trust is

1895
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,679
possible in the early conversation of

1896
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,440
this draft we had some comments saying

1897
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,440
yeah but what if you suddenly turn into

1898
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,840
an rbnb and of course we said well then

1899
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,280
in that case it's not really in the home

1900
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,120
environment you just turn your home into

1901
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,440
hospitality so it's not really a home

1902
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,880
environment anymore

1903
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,320
but then you know we had more and more

1904
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,480
feedback saying yeah but you know it's

1905
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:37,440
because you you american live with that

1906
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,440
middle of nowhere but if you are an

1907
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,360
apartment building uh you know your

1908
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,280
neighbors hear your mac because you hear

1909
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,719
their mac and they you know everybody

1910
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:47,120
hears each other um so you know the more

1911
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,440
we get this feedback the more i begin

1912
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,760
begin to doubt uh whether you know

1913
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,159
residential would be a good application

1914
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:56,800
for full trust scenario and that brings

1915
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,080
a question to this group and i have

1916
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,199
another one on the next slide so i'd

1917
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:00,880
like maybe to take five minutes here and

1918
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,320
five on the other

1919
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,159
do you think that home

1920
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:06,239
if we qualify it you know supposing that

1921
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:07,920
you don't have neighbors around sneaking

1922
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,440
on you behind your wall

1923
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,760
could be a full trust environment and if

1924
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,320
not um do you think of anything any

1925
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,840
place that could be a full trust

1926
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,760
environment where you would not be

1927
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,440
afraid of showing your mac address

1928
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,880
because you don't think that there would

1929
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,000
be a threat

1930
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,800
to your privacy in that environment

1931
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,560
let me post there to gather some

1932
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,440
thoughts on this question

1933
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:42,719
michael please call me

1934
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:45,600
hi i i can't see even if you have

1935
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,719
a

1936
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,360
mountain and you don't do airbnb i don't

1937
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,520
see that you want to reveal your mac

1938
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,280
addresses of your devices to these

1939
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,040
service people that will drive up your

1940
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,239
driveway may or may not be legitimately

1941
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,040
um

1942
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,360
the place where i think that maybe you

1943
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,600
could have a full trust environment is

1944
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,520
actually an in-enterprise

1945
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,000
um where all the devices the enterprise

1946
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,360
wants to know that all the devices

1947
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,800
belong to the enterprise and if there's

1948
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,159
anyone else that comes along with

1949
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:13,920
something else they're going to flag it

1950
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,159
and maybe

1951
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,239
there's going to be security detail that

1952
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:21,199
goes to remove the device from the thing

1953
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:23,679
um so i actually think that home is

1954
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:25,440
almost never ever going to be a full

1955
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,239
trust environment

1956
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:32,239
thank you thank you that's very useful

1957
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:33,679
yeah i like the idea of enterprise you

1958
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:36,640
know if it's an enterprise asset yes

1959
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,159
yeah that makes sense

1960
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:39,440
thank you

1961
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:42,400
thanks uh you join

1962
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,800
thank you um yeah i pretty much agree

1963
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,199
with what michael said um

1964
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:49,440
i also think that uh

1965
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,159
home environments uh cannot be fully

1966
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:54,400
trusted uh not only because there could

1967
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,840
be diverse attackers or

1968
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,199
um people trying to listen into your

1969
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:00,719
home network but

1970
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,560
precisely like you said also because

1971
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:03,920
there's uh

1972
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,239
there absolutely is uh

1973
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:08,640
a lack of security mechanisms right

1974
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,360
especially we're talking about um

1975
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,920
well regular homes that don't really

1976
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,679
have like um

1977
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:17,679
um

1978
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:19,760
i don't know like knowledge or resources

1979
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,199
to uh

1980
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:23,440
to put like secure mechanisms at their

1981
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,320
home um i also agree that in in this

1982
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,880
scenario enterprises could be seen as

1983
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,239
much more secure than home devices uh

1984
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:34,560
and in home devices i would i would even

1985
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:37,360
like to mention like my phone and um if

1986
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,040
i trusted both

1987
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,440
my phone and my laptop that are using my

1988
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,840
home network i would not be interested

1989
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,000
in things such as uh encryption of the

1990
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,640
dns for example because i should be

1991
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,360
trusting that network and and i don't

1992
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,640
um that's it

1993
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,560
thanks

1994
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,400
all right thank you very much thank you

1995
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,199
thank you thank you thank you yeah yeah

1996
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:01,520
thank you thanks a lot so we'll probably

1997
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,920
so we'll probably we will correct that

1998
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,640
section of the draft uh and suggest and

1999
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,480
suggest a different view anyone else in

2000
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,640
the queue before i move to the next one

2001
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,600
yes uh we have uh two people and then we

2002
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,679
move all right yeah i don't see the

2003
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:17,440
queue so please please guys

2004
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,320
i met you speaking um

2005
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,080
thanks for inviting us to comment on

2006
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,520
that so my first remark is um uh i don't

2007
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,600
think we can trust any place in the

2008
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,560
world where you will have other devices

2009
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,239
i already mentioned that in the mailing

2010
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:36,480
list but uh we are seeing a trend where

2011
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,840
any kind of device you have in your

2012
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,840
pocket especially the smartphones they

2013
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,880
are running all kinds of applications uh

2014
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,360
which are often including uh features

2015
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,840
that are scanning nearby devices whether

2016
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:52,000
they are bluetooth low energy wi-fi and

2017
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,320
some companies are already interested

2018
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,440
in um

2019
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,760
i mean collecting all those identifiers

2020
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:00,239
to to track and profile you and this is

2021
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:01,360
only for

2022
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:02,320
i mean

2023
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,800
the commercial entities trying uh to do

2024
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,040
some marketing profiling but i'm sure

2025
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,520
there are many other um

2026
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:12,400
scenarios here and um so

2027
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,120
my point is as long as you have all the

2028
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,159
devices

2029
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:18,320
i mean that you even the one you are

2030
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:21,520
controlling um you cannot really trust

2031
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,159
uh the environments and

2032
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:26,880
finally i think i mean do real really

2033
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,719
needs um a specific scenario where um

2034
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:34,080
food trust is required uh i mean what

2035
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,320
would be the benefits

2036
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,719
of that of having this specific case

2037
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:41,040
can't we apply um

2038
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,280
the rules that we have in non-fully

2039
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,320
trusted scenario uh to this one just in

2040
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:49,040
case uh there is a news dropper in range

2041
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,120
whether it's someone outside your house

2042
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,360
or just your smart smartphone listening

2043
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:56,639
on your other devices

2044
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,600
yeah thank you mateo and you know

2045
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,520
it's interesting because

2046
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,000
i i agree also going backwards in your

2047
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,840
inner statement i don't know if there is

2048
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,000
a place that is uh is a full trust

2049
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,840
environment um and maybe you know the

2050
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,280
conclusion is that you know full trust

2051
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,520
environments these place don't exist and

2052
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,080
that's fine and from from what i heard

2053
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,320
from the two previous commenters

2054
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,480
joey and michael is that the enterprise

2055
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,320
environment is such because it's control

2056
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,600
environment but also because they

2057
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,000
provide you their devices so the pii

2058
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,120
exposure here is you know close to none

2059
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,960
not because it's a it's an enterprise

2060
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:31,920
asset

2061
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:32,719
um

2062
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:35,440
so but also i i do see that in an

2063
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:36,800
enterprise there could be physical

2064
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,040
security where you know you cannot just

2065
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,960
stick on the wall and and you know sneak

2066
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,360
inside uh et cetera but yeah i see your

2067
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,960
point maybe there is no full trust

2068
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,639
environment at all i mean it's it's i

2069
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:47,920
mean it's good to define that

2070
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,760
environment and just say well

2071
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,600
on this planet sorry guys there is no

2072
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,840
such place

2073
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,000
okay thanks uh next in line is the ball

2074
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,360
[Music]

2075
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,400
now the the notion that you enterprises

2076
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,440
are very secure and all the same is just

2077
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,800
wrong

2078
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,199
there's a whole range of enterprises

2079
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:17,840
very big to very small some very open

2080
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,920
some very close you can't make these

2081
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,080
general characterizations

2082
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,679
and the other thing

2083
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:25,760
i would note is that

2084
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,199
that um

2085
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:28,639
you

2086
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:29,760
um

2087
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,840
you know the only way an enterprise or

2088
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,560
anywhere can validate who's connected to

2089
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,480
it is actually to do a real challenge

2090
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,320
where the user has to identify

2091
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,840
themselves you can't do this at the

2092
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,560
device level many enterprises allow

2093
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,000
people to bring

2094
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,840
their phone and connect to the local

2095
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:46,960
network

2096
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:50,159
and they do it by challenging it and

2097
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:51,760
causing the person to use their

2098
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,480
credentials to log in you can't do this

2099
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,639
just at the network layer

2100
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:59,280
um with mac addresses or whatever that

2101
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,360
may have been a convenient way to track

2102
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,440
people before but

2103
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,480
as we know no longer and there's there's

2104
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:09,280
just not a simple solution here that

2105
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:14,000
you can do at uh you know layer two

2106
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,679
anymore

2107
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:18,320
and you can you just can't assume say

2108
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,639
enterprises are secure and trustworthy

2109
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:22,400
because they're not and

2110
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,239
we've all read the reports about

2111
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:26,320
ransomware taking down very large

2112
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,960
enterprises so it's the world is much

2113
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,239
more messy

2114
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:32,638
thank you

2115
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,199
thank you bob and and this is you know

2116
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:36,560
one of the big reasons why we have this

2117
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,159
draft you know when we say there are

2118
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:39,840
enterprises where you know there may be

2119
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,440
full trust we're not saying all

2120
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,440
enterprises are full trust because

2121
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,199
everything is fine everywhere and i

2122
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:46,800
think it's you know it's critical to

2123
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,679
define where this this would be set if

2124
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:51,760
it would be set and i fully agree with

2125
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,400
your statement here we're looking at rcm

2126
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,400
right so we're saying uh exposing the

2127
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,480
mac address does that have consequence

2128
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,840
in terms of pii um in those environments

2129
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,360
and of course you know if the enterprise

2130
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,000
assets is the enterprises not yours uh

2131
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,239
and there is no pii there uh well you

2132
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:09,280
know you don't really care about

2133
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,440
exposing your mac because really there

2134
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,239
is nothing of you on on this device um

2135
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:15,840
but i also fully agree with your points

2136
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,199
on the authentication being being

2137
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:19,280
changed

2138
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,480
all right thank you very much thank you

2139
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,840
for this input

2140
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,719
another one i'd like to like

2141
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:26,800
if that's okay so i have a four four

2142
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,159
more minutes

2143
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:30,000
sure go ahead please okay thank you very

2144
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,880
much

2145
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,280
it's what i call the race conditions

2146
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,920
um so you know going back into this a

2147
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,040
total 11 eq in 2018

2148
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,159
um

2149
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,360
i'm you know i'm making a shortcut

2150
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,719
saying it's four beats changing the mac

2151
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:44,560
during association it's i mean it's not

2152
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,639
entirely true what it says is that the

2153
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:48,159
non-mp state connecting to an

2154
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:50,639
infrastructure bss shall retain a single

2155
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:52,080
mac address for the duration of its

2156
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,400
connection across an ess now to make it

2157
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,360
simple bss is one access point ess is

2158
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,719
when you move from one access point to

2159
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,480
the other and you know the context of

2160
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,239
that is to say if you change your mac

2161
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:03,840
well you break state and therefore you

2162
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,120
have to restart

2163
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,520
okay um so so that's the context where

2164
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,280
we operate where we say well once you're

2165
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,280
connecting to an access point if you

2166
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,880
want to be the same device on that

2167
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,719
access point you must keep your mac

2168
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:16,080
address because if you change it you're

2169
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,920
not the same device anymore and we start

2170
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:20,320
from scratch so that's where we were in

2171
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,840
2018

2172
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,840
since then

2173
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,760
there has been a lot of questions coming

2174
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:29,760
both in 8-11 bh and in 8-11 bi

2175
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,400
where um you know some authors have come

2176
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,360
and said

2177
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:35,120
well you know i may want to go out to

2178
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,360
lunch come back and reassociate which is

2179
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,440
you know regain the

2180
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,840
while still changing my mac address

2181
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,400
or you know for privacy reasons if i'm

2182
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,679
in a public environment i may want to

2183
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:49,440
have you know a secure connection to the

2184
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,520
access point within which secure tunnel

2185
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,159
i can maybe give an identifier but for

2186
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:55,280
the rest of the world you know the

2187
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,800
observers i'm going to change my mac

2188
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,560
every few minutes who knows

2189
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,400
so from the outside world you know my

2190
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,719
mac is changing but the ap still knows

2191
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:05,520
it's me somehow so knowing that these

2192
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,760
conversations are happening

2193
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,639
in the draft you know we do not make any

2194
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:13,440
assumption in the fact that your mac

2195
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,760
address has to stay stable as long as

2196
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,440
you're connected to an access point we

2197
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,440
don't don't mention this requirement

2198
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,560
anywhere

2199
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,639
and we had a couple of feedback saying

2200
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:24,480
dude you don't know you're not aware of

2201
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:27,280
it 11aq um because you know you cannot

2202
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,719
change your mac there so you know you

2203
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:30,639
are living up in the door to a problem

2204
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:33,360
doesn't exist um and you know of course

2205
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,800
every single time to every single

2206
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,800
contributor responded

2207
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,960
well it turns out we are aware of it but

2208
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,040
we don't know if that's going to hold

2209
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:44,320
true uh for the upcoming years uh and we

2210
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,080
don't make any provision there because

2211
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,480
it's not our problem in marinas it's an

2212
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:51,920
8011 problem so we don't define whether

2213
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,679
the rotation happens within a connection

2214
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:56,239
or not but because we we come back to

2215
01:26:56,239 --> 01:26:58,480
the these comments um i i wanted to

2216
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,480
bring the question to the group and ask

2217
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,960
do you think that leaving this door open

2218
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,040
as we do knowing that things are not

2219
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,520
necessarily carved in stone is okay or

2220
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,600
do you think that we should say well

2221
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,080
hold your horses you're riding here in

2222
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:15,760
you know 2000 um what is that 21

2223
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,560
november uh don't you know be specific

2224
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,800
about what happens is allowed in 2021

2225
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,480
november and if things change in three

2226
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,400
months then you'll change your draft um

2227
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,760
so what is what do you think is the

2228
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,760
right direction keeping the door open as

2229
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,239
we do uh today say not specify here

2230
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:32,239
because that's our mininus job or should

2231
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:34,560
we you know be specific about what is

2232
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,880
today available and you know and to

2233
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,199
change the draft or revise it if if

2234
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:41,759
things change

2235
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,560
thanks uh

2236
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:48,159
let's go with dan first

2237
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:53,520
can you hear me

2238
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,320
now we can hear you okay thanks

2239
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,520
uh

2240
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:58,880
so

2241
01:27:58,880 --> 01:27:59,760
yes

2242
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,840
aq assumes that you've got a single mac

2243
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:04,159
address that you you return to when you

2244
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:06,400
connect back to the ess

2245
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,360
but that's i think going to be addressed

2246
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:12,560
in bi when the

2247
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,239
pmk id uh

2248
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,480
privacy has been been addressed because

2249
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:21,600
that will allow a stay to reuse a pmk id

2250
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,800
identify secure state on the ap

2251
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,080
using a random mac address so from the

2252
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:29,600
point of view of what what madness

2253
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,280
should do i would say nothing we should

2254
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,560
just let

2255
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,080
let bi

2256
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,000
continue doing what

2257
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,280
bias said they're going to be doing

2258
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:43,199
thank you dan so so if i hear you

2259
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:45,840
correctly you're saying we should not be

2260
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,440
specifying any

2261
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,679
known or expected product projected

2262
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:51,360
behavior right we just

2263
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,840
lift things to the group that deal with

2264
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,440
it and not you know make a new

2265
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,040
assumption about what trudeau should not

2266
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,800
happen right

2267
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,560
yes that is

2268
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:03,199
but that's my suggestion but

2269
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:04,000
okay

2270
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,920
thank you thank you very much good idea

2271
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,360
thanks

2272
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,320
thank you

2273
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:11,040
thanks and i i put myself in the queue

2274
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:11,840
uh

2275
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,480
i think uh i agree i think that this is

2276
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:17,920
the real mafido 211 and uh vi

2277
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,600
specifically is going to want to talk

2278
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,960
about this

2279
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,320
pmk id

2280
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:23,600
but

2281
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,360
i guess my take would be that probably

2282
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,760
for for the documentary when when you

2283
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,000
mentioned the draftsuniga the

2284
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,840
uh from the informational point of view

2285
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,239
i think uh it doesn't hurt to say

2286
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:36,239
there are this type of conversations in

2287
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:39,520
uh like next steps or or follow-up uh

2288
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:42,560
section of the draft just so that we we

2289
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,880
we remind people that it's not uh

2290
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,120
uh written in stone and and it's

2291
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:48,719
something that it's never going to

2292
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:51,360
change but rather that it's evolving

2293
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,360
at that point in time the purpose of the

2294
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,600
of the draft being to to say what is

2295
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,320
this current status i think that

2296
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,719
if these conversations are taking place

2297
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:03,120
uh it's fair to at least mention that

2298
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,719
the conversation is taking place and

2299
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:07,600
where

2300
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:09,199
makes sense thank you very much thank

2301
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:11,599
you very much

2302
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,960
thanks

2303
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,880
all right and that's it for this

2304
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,800
presentation so thank you again for

2305
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,040
everybody uh to to everybody who who

2306
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,120
took the care to provide feedback will

2307
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,800
integrate the changes and propose you

2308
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,400
know an updated version of this draft

2309
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:27,280
within the next few weeks

2310
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:30,159
great thank you very much jerome and as

2311
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:33,040
expressed in the in the mailing list

2312
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:35,520
by by some people uh

2313
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:36,960
thanks michael

2314
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,440
uh the idea is to uh

2315
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,520
to adopt this this draft and and we'll

2316
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,000
go to that uh at the end of the meeting

2317
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,360
if that's okay

2318
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,320
uh we'll go now to present the other

2319
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,800
draft that we have

2320
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,960
and then we'll do the call for adoption

2321
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,040
for both drafts at the end

2322
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,920
so amelia

2323
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,520

i expect invisible um uh audible i was

2325
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,760
going to ask if you're the catalyst of

2326
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,520
one could you just play this the slides

2327

2328
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:15,960
thank you

2329
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:18,559
um

2330
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,400
do you want to do it or sorry or do you

2331
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,560
want me to project this

2332
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,880
um go ahead and project i think it will

2333
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,000
be easier to reduce the risk of me

2334
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,080
having software problems

2335
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,000
um so

2336
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,600
this is an updated version of a

2337
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,800
presentation that we already saw in july

2338
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,960
um of this year so

2339
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,480
for those of you who are already in the

2340
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:45,520
july meeting a lot of this will look

2341
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:48,560
familiar and it's a quick run-through of

2342
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:51,600
the draft on mac address randomization

2343
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:55,840
with some updates that next slide please

2344
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,400
um

2345
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:02,800
uh and so the goals of this draft is uh

2346
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,400
simply to document the current state of

2347
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,679
affairs regarding mac address

2348
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:08,400
randomization at the iedf and other sdos

2349
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:11,440
what's been going on so far

2350
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,760
next slide please

2351
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:17,280
um we have a table of contents um

2352
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,560
with the

2353
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,600
uh

2354
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,480
yeah

2355
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,840
that goes over

2356
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,120
all of

2357
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,719
the activities that most of them we've

2358
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:27,360
already heard about today

2359
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:29,040
so i'm not going to

2360
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,320
spend

2361
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:34,480
so much time reiterating um

2362
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,639
what is already been said during

2363
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:38,480
this meeting um

2364
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,480
i'll just let you reflect upon this

2365
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,639
table of contents for a while and then

2366
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:45,120
ask carlos to quickly step ahead to

2367
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,920
slide nine with os current

2368
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,840
practices

2369
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:50,719
um

2370
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:54,480
actually it should be on slide seven um

2371
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,880
because this is the most recent

2372
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,600
um update and so

2373
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:02,639
uh what we've done since july is

2374
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:05,120
basically map out

2375
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:07,360
how mobile operating systems are

2376
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:08,960
currently randomizing their mac

2377
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,440
addresses

2378
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,400
this can be either done by randomizing

2379
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,400
the mac address

2380
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:20,400
between connections to an ssid

2381
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:24,320
or and this is the most common

2382
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:25,199
um

2383
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:26,000
that

2384
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,480
a mac address is kept for the same ssid

2385
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,400
or within the same network

2386
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,560
um

2387
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:34,639
and we've checked whether this happens

2388
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:36,960
on

2389
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,040
for which platforms this happens and how

2390
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,800
different implementers are doing that if

2391
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:44,000
you go to the next slide on slide eight

2392
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,360
you can see what capabilities are

2393
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:48,560
available in linux android 10 windows 10

2394
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,080
ios 14 plus you're invited to review

2395
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:53,540
these slides um

2396
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:54,880
[Music]

2397
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,880
so

2398
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,280
fairly descriptive table already

2399
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:01,040
the draft has also been updated to a

2400
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,239
version

2401
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:04,000
uh one

2402
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
to reflect these uh

2403
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,239
new investigations

2404
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:08,630
um

2405
01:34:08,630 --> 01:34:10,880
[Music]

2406
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,960
and uh

2407
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,320
i think we've also addressed some

2408
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:17,440
comments from jerome hungary so next

2409
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,679
slide please

2410
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:20,050
um

2411
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:21,600
[Music]

2412
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:22,480
and

2413
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,400
next slide please

2414
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,480
if you have any further comments and

2415
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:29,360
reviews please share them with me or

2416
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:33,920
juan carlos or carlos thank you

2417
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,440
carlos

2418
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,678
yes

2419
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:44,840
this

2420
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:47,440
is as a

2421
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,600
chair here so just to complement what

2422
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,840
amelia said regarding the changes we we

2423
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,040
made some

2424
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:57,040
editorial changes uh to uh to basically

2425
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,960
match or better adapt to the to the

2426
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,600
madinah charter that is now approved

2427
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:04,080
we also changed the name of the draft so

2428
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:07,440
it now draft suniga madinas

2429
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:10,000
to although that the other the other

2430
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,159
name was also representative enough but

2431
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:13,440
just to

2432
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:16,000
to follow the typical practices and then

2433
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
regarding the mobile oss

2434
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,040
changes

2435
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,760
let me go back just to that uh

2436
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,360
to that slide we added this which

2437
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:25,040
basically the vbs to

2438
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:26,480
document and is related to the

2439
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:28,560
discussion that we had just had with

2440
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:32,159
jerome on the what the oss are doing

2441
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:34,400
today so this is an attempt to kind of

2442
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,639
characterize what they are doing of

2443
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:38,800
course these are these things are very

2444
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,960
much alive and the the

2445
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,880
practices are changing

2446
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:45,600
but this was an attempt of basically see

2447
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:48,320
what they are doing in terms of if the

2448
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,880
address is uh stable or persistent per

2449
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,280
network per connection if the changes

2450
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,760
daily or not if it depends or allows to

2451
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:58,480
do a configuration different pair ssib

2452
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,639
or not and also

2453
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:03,119
looking at what how they behave in terms

2454
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:04,639
of the mac addresses that they use when

2455
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:05,760
they are

2456
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,280
doing scanning not yet associated to any

2457
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,040
specific network

2458
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,520
we already got some comments from jerome

2459
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,239
uh on things like the table and some uh

2460
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:17,920
corrections so

2461
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,679
please we would like to get as much

2462
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:21,920
feedback as possible not only in the

2463
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,159
actual content that maybe there are some

2464
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:26,960
mistakes we we try to be as rich as

2465
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,480
possible but of course we there may be

2466
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:31,440
some errors but also in the way we could

2467
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:32,239
uh

2468
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:34,880
keep that documentation because it's

2469
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:38,000
since things may change we may want to

2470
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,840
reflect in the document a bit the the

2471
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,520
evolution not only the current state the

2472
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:44,239
current picture at as as the moment of

2473
01:36:44,239 --> 01:36:45,119
the

2474
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:47,199
the document is is released

2475
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:48,800
uh well that was just it's just too

2476
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:53,159
complicated with amelia said thanks

2477
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:59,920
thanks for that carlos indeed i think

2478
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:01,760
again this document being informational

2479
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:02,639
it

2480
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:04,639
provides a good snapshot but also a

2481
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:07,679
historic of how things are evolving

2482
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:08,480
and

2483
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:10,480
as we can see clearly

2484
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:11,280
the

2485
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:12,480
uh

2486
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,960
lack of consistency in the behavior of

2487
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:17,199
different uh implementations it's also

2488
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:20,880
something that we need to be aware

2489
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,400
great so

2490
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:25,520
thank you very much amelia

2491
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,920
i guess we can move now to

2492
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:30,080
the

2493
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,600
yes thanks

2494
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:36,000
the last part

2495
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,520
uh and the idea now is to

2496
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,840
to adopt these two drafts so

2497
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:44,480
let's start with the draft uh

2498
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:46,639
henry medina's framework zero three the

2499
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:49,280
one presented by jerome previously

2500
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,679
again this document has been discussed

2501
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:54,239
at length on the mailing list

2502
01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:55,360
so

2503
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,360
the idea is to adopt it

2504
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:58,880
as a working group

2505
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,560
item

2506
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,360
and uh for that we want to just ask here

2507
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,360
if there are any questions or comments

2508
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,600
regarding adopting this draft of course

2509
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,119
we will be

2510
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:11,600
confirmed on the mailing list but first

2511
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,840
let me ask uh the group are there any

2512
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,440
comments or

2513
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:17,280
anyone speaking in favor or against

2514
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:20,840
adopting this draft

2515
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:35,119
no comments

2516
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,199
we did see some proposals in the mailing

2517
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:38,480
list to

2518
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,080
get it adopted but

2519
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,320
yes

2520
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,719
rich uh

2521
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:46,480
so my only concern

2522
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:48,080
and we can

2523
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,239
address that somehow is you know the

2524
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:52,880
informational slides about well this is

2525
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:53,840
what

2526
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:57,760
android 10 does or what windows 95 did

2527
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:00,400
that stuff tends to get out of date

2528
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:03,040
um it also means we have to be very

2529
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,880
careful about

2530
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:07,280
surveying a large part of the community

2531
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:10,320
like you know why android and not safari

2532
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:11,440
or

2533
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:12,639
books or

2534
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:14,480
you know ios

2535
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:15,760
so i'm just worried about that issue

2536
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,520
which i think the working group can

2537
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:19,040
address because once it's published as

2538
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:21,440
an rfc then it's in stone forever and

2539
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,760
people will not notice

2540
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,679
that the information is now two years

2541
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:27,679
out of date

2542
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:29,600
just to concern not arguing against

2543
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:31,520
adoption

2544
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:33,679
uh thanks um

2545
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:36,159
right now we're we're on on draft

2546
01:39:36,159 --> 01:39:38,639
henry which is the previous draft uh

2547
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:40,159
you i guess you're referring to the to

2548
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:42,239
the second draft but uh

2549
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:44,800
the point is well well taken so we will

2550
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:47,199
address that when we move to the next uh

2551
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:49,040
the next draft uh

2552
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,720
sorry about the confusion

2553
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:52,880
[Music]

2554
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:55,840
bob

2555
01:39:58,040 --> 01:39:59,280
[Music]

2556
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:02,639
and that is these tables which

2557
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:04,639
you don't want them to be locked down in

2558
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:06,159
an rsc

2559
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:09,119
we now have github and github can be

2560
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:10,880
tied to the work group and the rest of

2561
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,239
it you can reference the github in the

2562
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:16,639
document point to where it is and then

2563
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:19,600
maintain these tables as a living thing

2564
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:22,560
instead of just a static in rfc consider

2565
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:25,199
doing that

2566
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:30,560
uh thanks uh bob that was an answer to

2567
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:33,760
to reach uh comment ballot but also

2568
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,600
addressing the the other draft not the

2569
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:36,719
one that is

2570
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:38,159
being displayed right now sorry about

2571
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:39,440
the confusion maybe we should have made

2572
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,760
a call for adoption right after the

2573
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,119
the draft uh

2574
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:44,239
henry

2575
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:45,679
um

2576
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:48,719
but again uh

2577
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,800
we'll go back to to to that uh point

2578
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,880
about the the table on the on the second

2579
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,679
draft now moving back again to the first

2580
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:58,000
draft uh draft henry medina is the one

2581
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,400
presented before by by jerome

2582
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:01,760
uh

2583
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:02,960
if there are

2584
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,199
one last call for for comments

2585
01:41:05,199 --> 01:41:07,119
otherwise i guess we can move to the to

2586
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:11,440
the mailing list the call for adoption

2587
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:17,840
all right so if there are no more

2588
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,920
comments on on draft hearing medina's

2589
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,600
we'll call for adoption on the mailing

2590
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:22,960
list

2591
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:25,520
and we'll see if we can get it adopted

2592
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,800
there

2593
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:30,600
uh next slide please

2594
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:34,560
so this is the second call for adoption

2595
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:37,679
and for draft swimming and latinas uh

2596
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:39,520
and this is the one that uh we've

2597
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,600
already got two comments uh regarding

2598
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,000
the the table showing the discrepancy

2599
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,119
between behaviors and operating systems

2600
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:48,400
when it comes to mac address

2601
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,320
randomization

2602
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,639
being a

2603
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:56,080
co-author of this draft i will move

2604
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:59,440
myself away from the mic and i will let

2605
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:02,320
mature coach uh run this call for

2606
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:03,440
adoption

2607
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:05,280
matthew do you want to open your mic

2608
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:07,199
please yes

2609
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:09,920
okay uh so i'm gonna

2610
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,719
uh and all that from now um

2611
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:16,639
joey you're the next in line

2612
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:19,280
actually i was trying to get it uh

2613
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:21,679
active for the previous draft i'm sorry

2614
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:22,560
all right

2615
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,800
for the delays sorry um i just wanted to

2616
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:27,040
say that i would support adoption of the

2617
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:29,840
henry medina's draft

2618
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,920
just after after making the changes

2619
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:34,000
specifically about the trust and how to

2620
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,960
set the levels of trust

2621
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,480
and yeah that's that's what i wanted to

2622
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:42,040
add thanks

2623
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,799
michael

2624
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:48,800
so um

2625
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:51,840
i will echo what bob said about the

2626
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,520
tables and things like this but i think

2627
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:55,679
that actually the useful thing that this

2628
01:42:55,679 --> 01:42:57,199
document could do

2629
01:42:57,199 --> 01:42:58,960
rather like i think one of the early

2630
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:01,679
behave documents for nat

2631
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:04,080
is to just give names to the different

2632
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:07,520
policies that we have seen over time

2633
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,520
not say who does them at one point in

2634
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:11,360
this document but rather to say these

2635
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:14,480
are the policies that we've seen

2636
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,800
and

2637
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:19,920
that way we can talk intelligently about

2638
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:21,360
you know things even if we just call

2639
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:23,600
them type 1 and type 2 and type seven or

2640
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,360
something like that at least we could

2641
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,760
have a better conversation about um you

2642
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:30,239
know if the devices and it does type one

2643
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:32,320
policy then you expect this kind of

2644
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:33,520
thing to happen

2645
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,600
um and the table

2646
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:37,360
later on could tell us what versions of

2647
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:42,239
what os's did what things in the past

2648
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:45,860
dave

2649
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:47,600
[Music]

2650
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,440
yeah so i'm actually going to say very

2651
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:52,719
similar things to what michael said and

2652
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:55,119
i guess as a past behaved working group

2653
01:43:55,119 --> 01:43:57,520
chair that's probably not surprising um

2654
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:59,840
i think i have no personal opinion as to

2655
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:02,560
whether there is a snapshot of a table

2656
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:05,440
in the document or only on github right

2657
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,760
i'd find either way with that one

2658
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:08,480
but

2659
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:09,920
i think the main value that can be

2660
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:11,840
provided as michael said is if you look

2661
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:14,719
at the table the definition of the rows

2662
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:16,320
right is kind of similar to what michael

2663
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,719
was saying right you can define a set of

2664
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,560
the types of behaviors that you've seen

2665
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:22,320
out there regardless of exactly which

2666
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:23,840
operating systems and stuff they map to

2667
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,199
or which versions of which operating

2668
01:44:25,199 --> 01:44:27,440
systems if you can define the taxonomy

2669
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:29,679
by which uh the

2670
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:31,440
github or whatever the table is whether

2671
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:32,639
it's in the document or github if you

2672
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:34,560
can define the taxonomy of what

2673
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,639
behaviors are that you've seen so far i

2674
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:38,480
think that in and of itself is valuable

2675
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:43,159
to adopt in the working group so thanks

2676
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:53,320
any of the comment questions

2677
01:45:04,239 --> 01:45:05,199
all right

2678
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:06,080
um

2679
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,239
if there is no other

2680
01:45:08,239 --> 01:45:12,400
questions um i suggest we continue the

2681
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:14,639
discussion to the mailing list and there

2682
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:16,480
will be a call for adoption on the

2683
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:19,040

eric

yes

2700
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:53,760
sorry for wearing a mask i'm basically

2701
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:56,000
in my desk home and there's a technician

2702
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,400
nearby so i apologize for the noise it

2703
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:00,719
was unexpected

2704
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:01,920
anyway

2705
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:03,679
i would love let's say for the first

2706
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:06,000
meeting seeing about 60 to 70

2707
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,679
participants in the meeting with many

2708
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:09,280
interactions on the chat

2709
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,199
it's really a proof that this working

2710
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:13,280
group needed to exist

2711
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:15,600
just to clarify i would also like to

2712
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:19,280
thank teams for wba and glenn and ieee

2713
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:22,719
for presenting their sdo point of view

2714
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:24,480
it's always interesting when multiple

2715
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:28,480
sdo works and now removing my ed hat

2716
