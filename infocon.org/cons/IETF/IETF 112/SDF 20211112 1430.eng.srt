00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,119
to the notes for today where michael is

27
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,640

28
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,880
and michael is also acting as jabra

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,320
policies we will not go into detail on

38
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,000
this

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,119
um here is a slightly more expanded part

40
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,880
of the code of conduct that hasn't been

41
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,720
in a discussion lately

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,680
um it's basically about

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,040
you know treating your colleagues with

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,640
respect speak slowly limit use of slang

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,680
dispute ideas by using recent

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,040
arguments

47
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,200
use best engineering judgement find best

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,040
solution for whole internet

49
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,640
and contribute to the ongoing work of

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,280
the group in the iedf and so this is

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
what you need to keep in mind uh when

52
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,360
you participate in this meeting we try

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,038
to be polite to each other

54
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,480
and if you need more information there

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,679
is the rfc up there

56
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,480
this is the agenda for today we've

57
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,400
already done the note well

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,720
for the logistics we have a kodi md

59
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,560
michael is taking notes there was a link

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,040
previously you can find it

61
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,200
there's the meet echo and you you're on

62
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,319
it right now

63
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,400
we don't do blue blue sheets because

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,599
they are automatically generated

65
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,599
we will continue with the working group

66
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,879
status

67
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,680
update um and then continue with the

68
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,519
main meet of the meeting which is the

69
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,000
sdf getting sdf ready for working group

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,599
last call

71
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,239
after that we have a couple of um

72
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,280
new work items or related work

73
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,920
that we will sort of uh be looking at

74
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,599
and we will sort of try to work out how

75
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,159
to fit them into the bigger sdf story on

76
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,840
protocol mappings instances and

77
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,519
relationships

78
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,599
finally we are looking at the asdf

79
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,120
milestones we do have a pretty packed

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,840
agenda so we will be moving along at the

81
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,480
brisk pace

82
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,760
so uh an admin i mentioned all this

83
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,360
already so you don't there's nothing

84
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,720
special here

85
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,280
uh decisions on mailing lists and work

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,480
on github

87
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,400
and we tried to do in addition to these

88
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,480
meetings at the

89
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,319
not the physical ifdfs but the virtual

90
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,799
physical idfs we also do virtual

91
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,640
interims and

92
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,519
we have had a couple so far

93
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,280
this is the status update where we are

94
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,519
right now we were chartered a year ago a

95
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,360
little more than a year ago

96
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,319
and we have had meetings at two itfs we

97
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,959
have had hackathons at these two ldfs

98
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,599
uh lately before this one we had a my

99
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,799
more on inofficial uh or or a simpler

100
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,040
hackathon we still work

101
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,519
that generated two ideas so it's good

102
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,879
stuff anyway

103
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,799
we've had four virtual interims and

104
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,239
we've had a spec that has reached

105
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,480
implementation implementation draft

106
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,000
status

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,920
and this is we're meeting today and

108
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,439
we're planning for another meeting

109
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,760
soonish maybe in january and we'll come

110
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,040
back to that later depending on the

111
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,000
discussion goes today

112
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,918
um

113
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,400
so on a related thing to asdf is of

114
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,400
course the one data model and the the

115
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,919
one data model was the activity that

116
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,400
kicked off this work initially created

117
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,280
in 2018 to harmonize iot data models

118
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,320
across multiple ecosystems such as ocf

119
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,199
and ipso and bluetooth etc

120
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,120
and this group had two

121
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,800
main objectives one was it it came out

122
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
two main objectives came out of this one

123
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,919
was this common format for defining data

124
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,919
and interaction models

125
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,240
and this resulted in sdf which were of

126
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,400
course working in this group here

127
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,280
and the other part is

128
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,360
developing this industry-based standard

129
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,120
best practice

130
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,199
iot device models

131
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,800
and they are

132
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,840
i'm putting them in a 1dm

133
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,440
repository and this was just a report

134
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,240
that this work is ongoing and we have a

135
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,800
review board and that work sort of and

136
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,280
on approving these models is is

137
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,240
happening right now

138
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,360
so

139
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,600
hopefully by next time we meet we can

140
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,639
have actually some adopted models in 1dm

141
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,800
which are of course defined in sdf but

142
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,479
ready for anybody who can translate from

143
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,199
sdf to their ecosystem

144
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,720
so with that i leave over to carsten to

145
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,039
take us through what remains before we

146
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,160
get to working loop lost coal and and

147
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,840
and on

148
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,479
carson please

149
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,080
yeah thank you

150
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,280
um so

151
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,400
there are a few things we have to do to

152
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
become ready for working plus call of

153
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,720
course there is the draft itself

154
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,319
and we also need to do some

155
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,840
administrational

156
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,360
uh things identify a document

157
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,280
shepherd that's usually done by the

158
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,280
working chair so if you want to say

159
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,479
anything

160
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,000
about that please do

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,800
i we have a proposal at least

162
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
for for a case of cornbread to be the

163
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,560
shepherd i just checked with him so i

164
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,000
haven't been able to propagate the

165
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,520
information

166
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,800
but uh

167
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,560
so i think that will that will work out

168
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,160
well he has read this back and so on and

169
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,720
he's happy to take it on

170
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,759
okay

171
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,759
so can you put the name in the notes

172
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,360
please um

173
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,919
so the other thing we need to do is

174
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,199
work on the draft and there are some

175
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,840
nine issues and two pull requests on the

176
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,199
repository at this point

177
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,440
and there are a couple actual change

178
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,720
requests

179
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,360
there is one issue that talks about the

180
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,199
limitation with the formal description

181
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,639
technique we are

182
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,759
using and we we have to diagnose whether

183
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,560
that's really something we need to

184
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,199
work around or we can live with

185
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,360
there are various tasks that need to be

186
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,520
done just editorial tasks

187
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,680
um there is some tools work that needs

188
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,840
to be completed because appendix b is

189
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,479
generated out of appendix a and there

190
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,280
are

191
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,639
limitations

192
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,400
in that tool

193
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,560
and there's also potential future work

194
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,840
that we

195
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,440
will be talking about in the last 20

196
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,759
minutes of this

197
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,840
work group meeting

198
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,479
which we don't have to complete

199
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,000
but we probably should look at it to

200
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,440
make sure we don't

201
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,840
paint ourselves into a corner here by

202
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,840
doing something in the base draft

203
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,400
that makes the future work harder

204
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,960
next slide

205
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,120
so

206
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,319
there are

207
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,240
two change requests so let's talk about

208
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,400
the first one

209
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,360
pull request 45

210
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,919
stupid that ari isn't

211
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,400
here we had a last minute

212
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,199
uh

213
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,919
thing getting in the way

214
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,440
so

215
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,879
we have

216
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,520
much less experience with action and

217
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,560
event

218
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,080
performances

219
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,560
then with properties

220
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,639
affordances

221
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,319
so

222
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,400
each time somebody

223
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,639
touches the the action event

224
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,560
stuff again

225
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,360
then yeah it turns out it's maybe not

226
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,360
not the most

227
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,679
streamlined way to talk about these

228
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,279
affordances

229
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,159
and we we thought we had

230
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,559
fixed this in sdf 1.1

231
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,839
but maybe we we swung the pendulum a

232
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,080
little bit too far

233
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,360
and

234
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,839
we may want to look at that again so

235
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,560
right now in sdf 1.1

236
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,959
we have a single data type definition

237
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,120
for the input and a single definition

238
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,800
for the output

239
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,360
and that that is often a little bit

240
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,240
unwieldy because it's very likely that

241
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,839
your action

242
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,560
will have more than one input

243
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,519
so pull request 45

244
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,640
suggests that maybe we make the the

245
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,000
object

246
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,880
that we would use to carry all these

247
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,640
different parameters

248
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,720
uh implicit again next slide please

249
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,680
um so for the input side it's

250
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,000
quite usual to have multiple parameters

251
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,920
it's much less useful to have multiple

252
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,160
parameters on the output side so doing

253
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,120
this for both or nothing which we

254
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,680
probably want to do for symmetry means

255
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,399
that one of them will be slightly harder

256
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,040
to read than the other but there is no

257
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,440
functional limitation

258
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
uh here

259
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,120
so the the um what are currently

260
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,839
property names will be some other kind

261
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,000
of sdf name for the

262
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,680
uh parameters

263
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,839
um but that's not probably not really a

264
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,360
big uh change

265
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,920
so we had some discussion in the last

266
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,240
few hours about that and we weren't

267
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,399
quite as sure

268
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,040
anymore whether this is actually

269
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,560
needed so

270
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,360
my request would be for for people to

271
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,839
look at the issue in more detail

272
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,880
or if you already have experienced this

273
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,839
uh

274
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,320
a little bit of

275
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,000
inconvenience

276
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,839
maybe you can tell us now

277
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,240
okay i'm not seeing people

278
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,279
line up in the speaker queue

279
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,600
so maybe we can leave this by the way

280
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,200
side and talk about the next change

281
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,880
request

282
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,439
next slide

283
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,000
um

284
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,839
right

285
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,680
now the

286
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,800
structure of an sdf json file is that we

287
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,600
have

288
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,040
altered

289
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,860
levels of

290
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,600
[Music]

291
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,600
sdf

292
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,200
categories concepts

293
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,399
and

294
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,120
specifier defined names

295
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,600
and these specified defined names go

296
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,720
into

297
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,360
a single default namespace that is

298
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,000
defined up there in the namespace

299
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,519
block

300
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,279
and the question is

301
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,839
does it make sense to maybe allow a

302
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,279
single

303
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,560
specification to to make definitions

304
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,200
that turn up in different

305
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,920
name spaces

306
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,600
it would be possible to do something

307
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,440
like that the the problem is that i

308
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,680
haven't seen

309
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,600
a good proposal how we could continue to

310
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
use json pointers in the straightforward

311
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,440
way that we're using them

312
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,079
now once we do that

313
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,680
because the json pointers would actually

314
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,120
have

315
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,160
queries in them with with prefixes that

316
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,320
are defined in the

317
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,760
uh

318
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,560
spec the json pointer points into and

319
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
this is uh

320
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,790
getting a bit ugly

321
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,040
[Music]

322
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,600
so um this is an issue right now it's

323
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,279
not a specific pull request

324
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,240
so if you think that this

325
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,880
issue is important to address

326
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,800
uh then we should have a discussion on

327
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,560
how we could actually

328
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,480
make something work that addresses the

329
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,680
issue

330
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,320
if we don't address it it just means

331
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,760
you have to have

332
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,880
multiple sdf specs

333
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,079
to to export into different namespaces

334
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,880
and that's of course always a little bit

335
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,920
uh

336
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,760
yeah you have to

337
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,000
juggle these

338
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,600
different files if you remember

339
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,360
programming in java

340
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,440
that is sometimes a little bit ugly like

341
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,880
what is that uh why do people need to

342
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,839
have to emit into multiple namespaces

343
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,480
what is this what is the pull on the

344
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,680
other side to doing that

345
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,040
i understand what's difficult for us to

346
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,560
do it but i understand why do people

347
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,079
want to do it

348
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,720
yeah so um

349
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,040
i think one can can come up with a lot

350
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,760
of use cases but they are

351
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,320
not that strong so imagine you are

352
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,160
writing a

353
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,800
translation from an ecosystem

354
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,240
model and want to to

355
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,279
factor out some data type that actually

356
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,959
is interesting enough that you want to

357
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,839
put it into a common library

358
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,920
then you cannot have a single file that

359
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,279
does

360
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,440
these two things

361
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,360
and some people would argue yeah that's

362
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
exactly what we want we want that you

363
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,120
write two files because one goes into

364
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,639
the common library and the other one is

365
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,839
the thing model that you are just

366
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,279
creating

367
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,360
so that's why these use cases are weak

368
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,600
because you can always make the

369
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,120
the argument if you're going into

370
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,800
multiple namespaces then it should be

371
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,720
different

372
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,120
files

373
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,519
ivory is on the side of sdf not on the

374
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,639
side of the

375
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,800
of the output the other side of the

376
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,399
translated tubes what i think you're

377
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,760
saying

378
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,000
yeah so a translator should probably be

379
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,600
able to to

380
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,800
consume

381
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,120
multiple sdf

382
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,240
models

383
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,639
and translate it into something that

384
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,880
that is made might be multiple models or

385
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,680
a single model on the ecosystem side so

386
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,680
it's not necessarily a one-to-one

387
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,399
uh translation and that may be

388
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,120
yeah it may require doing additional

389
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,120
control files that control these um

390
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,690
interrelationships and so on so um

391
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,639
[Music]

392
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,399
yeah i'm having a hard time actually

393
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,160
arguing for this because i'm pretty sure

394
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,120
we don't want to do this but i'm doing

395
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,920
my best to make the argument

396
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,580
uh here

397
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,779
[Music]

398
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,519
unless someone's really speaking up for

399
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,199
this i think we should just let it go

400
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,240
i agree

401
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:29,839
yeah

402
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,000
we need to check with ari as well

403
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,800
or see if he joins later but um unless

404
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,120
he objects i think we should

405
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,680
just skip this okay thanks

406
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,959
please continue the next slide

407
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,560
so there is one

408
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,519
little

409
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,199
ugly thing

410
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,719
if you have an sdf choice

411
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,440
and the

412
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,959
alternatives

413
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,920
are actually quite similar

414
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,120
then

415
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,360
you don't want to repeat all the

416
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,040
properties

417
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,360
that's the wrong word all the qualities

418
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,600
of each choice in in

419
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,199
[Music]

420
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,519
every single alternative but you want to

421
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,120
factor them out

422
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,079
and that should be possible but right

423
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,800
now the the way we are describing this

424
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,759
choice

425
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,320
makes it hard to do that

426
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,920
which is just one instance of a larger

427
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,199
problem which is that we

428
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,600
we are using the grammar to these to

429
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,000
describe the input to the processing

430
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,560
model but the processing model actually

431
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
has several steps

432
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,839
which could be called resolution steps

433
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,160
that generate the thing that

434
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,370
really needs to conform to this grammar

435
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,560
[Music]

436
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,839
uh so that that's a limitation that that

437
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,240
tools will have to struggle with so they

438
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,959
cannot simply validate input they might

439
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,720
have to do resolution first before they

440
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,559
actually know whether everything that's

441
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,160
required

442
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,119
is present in in the document because it

443
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,720
has been pulled in using sdf ref

444
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,599
um

445
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,520
yeah so that's

446
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,799
one area where we might want to try to

447
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,280
have some ideas but unless people have

448
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,039
ideas how to

449
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,799
solve this it probably will stay that

450
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,799
way

451
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,080
this this comes up in in translator

452
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,280
building if you have an

453
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,980
enum or something in in a source

454
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,919
[Music]

455
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,480
ecosystem and you're translating this

456
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,520
and you essentially have to blow up

457
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,919
the attributes that come with this enum

458
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,280
into the branches of the the sdf choice

459
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,010
so it's it's

460
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,559
[Music]

461
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,520
not beautiful but it's also not really

462
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,080
killing us

463
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,400
okay nobody cares about that then let's

464
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,039
go to the next one

465
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,320
yeah there are a number of tasks that

466
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,640
need to be done before we can last call

467
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,240
this like uh

468
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,200
do we use the optional commas in cdl and

469
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,600
do our json text

470
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,720
examples actually all parse

471
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,520
can we add some automated checks and so

472
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,760
on and of course we should try to

473
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,160
collect more editorial

474
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,880
uh reviews by by people who are reading

475
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,520
this for the first time and and may

476
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,280
uh be be having trouble understanding uh

477
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,960
some some of the wording that we're

478
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,000
using

479
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,840
so that's something that has to happen

480
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,480
within the next couple of months to to

481
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,280
make sure that we have a readable

482
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,200
document if we don't do it now then the

483
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,400
isg will force us to do it later and

484
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,280
it takes longer

485
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,520
next slide

486
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
there's also a little bit of tool work

487
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,600
needed

488
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,000
so that there is one um

489
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,760
issue

490
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,280
that describes how to actually make the

491
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,520
the co-occurrence constraints of the

492
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,120
json schema inspired part of the ctdl

493
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,720
a little bit

494
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,840
more tight

495
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,440
but we cannot do this at the moment

496
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,310
because the

497
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,520
[Music]

498
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,840
tool that translates cdl into json

499
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,559
schema org

500
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,960
doesn't support this this kind of

501
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
structure so

502
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,720
we we will need to fix this scenario

503
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,360
or do it by hand but that's really not

504
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,630
something i would want to do

505
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,679
[Music]

506
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,640
way too many way too much

507
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,760
potential for errors

508
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,360
yeah michael asks who could give the

509
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,520
document a read now to get this

510
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,600
editorial stuff

511
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,240
next slide

512
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,080
okay um so there are a little

513
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,720
set of items that are not in the the

514
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,880
next future work block

515
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,360
but that that maybe we should look at do

516
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,320
we want to do this now or

517
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,400
um leave it uh for future work

518
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,640
one is that we have a version field in

519
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,559
the info block

520
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,679
uh we all know that versions are hard

521
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,760
and versions usually

522
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,480
give us much less than they

523
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,159
do but if we have a version of you then

524
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,080
it should have

525
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,520
at least some

526
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,159
reason for existence and right now it's

527
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,000
not really defined

528
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,760
how you would use that there is a

529
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,600
suggestion that

530
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,280
that it starts with an rfc 339 or iso

531
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,919
8601 date

532
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,720
so you can

533
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,000
order

534
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,039
versions lexicographically

535
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,039
but we may want to

536
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,360
make a tighter definition of what the

537
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
version field

538
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,440
would be so that's one thing we want to

539
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,799
look at

540
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,200
and the other thing we may want to look

541
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,559
at is

542
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,080
when we are combining uh multiple sdf

543
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,159
files or more generally if we are

544
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,960
building sdf files out of multiple

545
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,440
ecosystem sources

546
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,280
how do we combine the information in

547
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,400
there so right now there is only one

548
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,120
copyright

549
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,679
entry in in the info block

550
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,000
uh by the way there is no no license

551
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,720
field in the oh there is a license field

552
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,880
in the info block but it's not fully

553
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,960
defined yet

554
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,760
and so on and by the way the the ops a

555
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,520
working group

556
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,600
is working on a similar thing for mud

557
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
files so they also try to get this

558
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,340
metadata

559
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,520
[Music]

560
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,799
more more

561
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,280
precisely defined so you have ownership

562
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,679
and licensing statements in yang so

563
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,080
maybe we also want to coordinate this a

564
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,918
little bit so it works together elliott

565
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,879
eliot

566
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,240
hi uh carson thanks uh just to comment

567
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,840
on that yeah that this is a draft that

568
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,919
you and i are writing um and it's been

569
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,600
accepted as a working group draft over

570
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,679
knobs areawg and the intent at least is

571
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,400
for it not simply to be used as you know

572
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,640
for mud files but rather if you have

573
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,799
stationary or static json

574
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,960
that that you're concerned you know you

575
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,320
need you need to have a licensing

576
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,039
statement you just sort of slap this in

577
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,039
and and it should be general along those

578
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,280
lines so people should review it for

579
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,200
in that context

580
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,000
yeah so we may want to be

581
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,799
compatible with this uh either literally

582
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,640
compatible or at least culturally

583
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,480
compatible so people will be able to

584
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,600
extract

585
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,480
that information in that form

586
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,360
and

587
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,880
that's probably something that that we

588
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,400
want to pay a little bit of attention to

589
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,880
next

590
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,000
breadcrumbs

591
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,039
um

592
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,760
so we have these these processing model

593
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,360
steps where we we put together

594
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,120
specs out of

595
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,320
multiple

596
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,600
sources

597
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,640
and one observation was that

598
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,760
when we do this we lose the information

599
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,279
what sources these actually came from

600
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,679
of course that hurts in the

601
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,520
info block as i already said but of

602
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
course you you also would

603
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,039
uh like to be able to to find out uh

604
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,159
what what kind of

605
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,640
thing is this here what kind of property

606
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
action event is this here did this come

607
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,240
from this or did this come from the

608
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,200
other

609
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,559
um so keeping some some more more

610
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,000
comment

611
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,120
level

612
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,919
uh

613
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,799
information uh there's a pull request

614
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,760
for that

615
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,240
which maybe doesn't quite have the right

616
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,679
shape

617
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,720
yet

618
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,520
and when we later come to mapping files

619
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,360
there's also there's also a

620
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,080
consideration that we may want to keep

621
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,440
information

622
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,159
about where parts of the specification

623
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,600
came from

624
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,520
of course you can just put it into the

625
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,760
comment fields but then you you

626
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,279
will have a hard time

627
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,120
uh tracing it back so having a little

628
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,600
bit more structured representation would

629
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,440
be good

630
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,279
so that's one thing we may want to look

631
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,559
at and number three

632
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,360
uh we may want to write up a little bit

633
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,440
more of our

634
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,600
own

635
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,000
guidelines we used when writing this

636
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,919
spec so when the next version is

637
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,320
generated we remember what those

638
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,840
guidelines were so

639
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,000
for instance there is an old issue that

640
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,480
asks when do we use the term sdf xxx and

641
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,600
when do we just use a naked

642
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,240
xx so why is it unit and not sdf unit

643
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,600
so

644
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,039
more generally we might want to record

645
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,480
invariants that we expect

646
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,200
to be maintained during the evolution

647
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,039
of the document

648
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,080
so if you you

649
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,360
say that again can you give me an exact

650
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,600
example of an invariant here

651
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,840
yeah for instance that we have this

652
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,480
alter alternation between user defined

653
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,120
names and and sdf defined

654
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,640
uh names

655
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,880
which we don't in the info block which

656
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,679
has an exception to that but everywhere

657
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:00,960
else we do

658
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,159
and um

659
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,640
this this is essentially um

660
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,039
an artifact of of

661
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,760
the the fact that jason has limited

662
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,360
expressibility

663
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,440
um so

664
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,880
in the programming language when you

665
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,799
declare something you give the type and

666
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,640
and the the name

667
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,039
but when you need two different levels

668
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,559
of of json to do that and things like

669
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,960
that we probably want to

670
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,039
explain and maybe also explain why in

671
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,799
the info block we have managed to keep

672
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,279
that in variant

673
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,000
yeah so um let's look at timelines and

674
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,039
and i brought some rose-colored glasses

675
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:53,559
for you to look at those timelines

676
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,720
everything i have talked about here we

677
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,679
can do this here

678
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,960
and if this turns into substantive

679
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,480
changes then we probably want to have

680
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,159
another implementation graph which would

681
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,000
be sdf 1.2

682
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,320
so people can actually

683
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,279
touch their tools and converters

684
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,200
and so on to make sure

685
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,240
they actually work with the next version

686
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,640
we don't make substantive changes then

687
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,520
we can continue calling this sdf 1.1 and

688
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,760
don't have a transition in the tool

689
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,600
space

690
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,559
and

691
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,480
if we have the implementation draft this

692
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,799
year we probably will have a few units

693
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,440
to fix and then we should be able to do

694
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,720
a work group last call in mid-january

695
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,559
and should be able to process the

696
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,399
working group call

697
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,959
comments

698
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,960
up to well early february or something

699
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,480
and if shepard and ad are fast we could

700
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,120
actually have an iitf last fall during

701
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,960
february

702
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,279
so if we manage to

703
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,760
run this without

704
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,919
larger surprises

705
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,080
we might have the telechat date in in

706
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,600
march

707
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,120
so this is what i want to achieve here

708
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,399
and

709
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,080
we will have to see whether we we can

710
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,240
make it do but

711
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,960
i think we should not take

712
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,679
um yeah and authors are fast francesca

713
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:22,720
indeed

714
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,960
um

715
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,200
we should

716
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,240
think about whether we take up and any

717
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,080
significant changes that would

718
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,000
jeopardize this timeline here

719
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,159
so that's okay

720
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,880
so thank you kirsten i mean this sounds

721
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,320
great

722
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,640
uh sir was there anyone in the queue no

723
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,120
uh this sounds really great uh thank you

724
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,799
for making all this progress um

725
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,559
do you think that because we had these

726
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,120
the first ones on this pr45 and the

727
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,200
namespace issue

728
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,240
i guess we can resolve them within

729
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,919
that shouldn't be a show stopper that

730
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,440
needs to be resolved somehow but they

731
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,880
are they are not really show stoppers

732
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,159
right

733
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,559
no we should reserve them with a within

734
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,640
the next six weeks

735
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,780
yeah and uh

736
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,600
[Music]

737
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,679
so we have some time for thinking and

738
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,600
writing

739
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,879
so i don't see a problem there

740
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,159
okay great

741
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,320
any comments from the rest of the group

742
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,360
great um out of this do you think we

743
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,840
should have

744
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,200
um um

745
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,320
uh

746
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,799
interim

747
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,120
should we try to plan an interim uh uh

748
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,039
to follow this time plan han here i

749
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,520
guess we need to have an interim

750
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
in the capital

751
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,399
early next year or something to

752
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,320
to to fix everything or or what do you

753
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,000
think

754
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,240
well there are several decision points

755
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,520
here

756
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,440
whether we have a decision point in

757
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,600
december i don't know yet because i

758
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,000
don't know whether we do an sdf 1.2 but

759
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,440
if we actually do

760
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,720
then actually we should have an

761
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,799
interrupt in december

762
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,080
and

763
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,919
then the actual working group last call

764
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,320
and yet at the end of that we probably

765
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,399
want to have an interim to process those

766
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,799
comments

767
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,399
so that would be late in january

768
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,080
um and

769
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,679
yeah then we have to react to the

770
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,640
last call comments to the ad

771
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,880
comments or to the shepherd report as

772
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,280
well

773
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,279
[Music]

774
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,200
so that's a bit harder to plan right now

775
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,600
but it might even be useful to have

776
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,440
another one in february so this would

777
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,039
mean that we have

778
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,600
about one per month

779
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,080
of these

780
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,799
okay okay

781
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,559
we don't have to i mean we can schedule

782
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,880
them now and if we decide

783
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,120
uh we we got by without them we can just

784
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,799
cancel them yeah

785
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,799
so let's let's figure out how to scale

786
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,399
them afterwards i think we can do that

787
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,640
with a doodle or something

788
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,519
great

789
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,200
um

790
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,960
no comforter comments on this or

791
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,440
questions

792
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,440
i hope everybody will read the

793
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,120
specification and figure out lots of

794
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,159
questions so we can stretch them quickly

795
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,760
great let's move on then um uh

796
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,120
i think we're actually ahead of schedule

797
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,240
here for a couple of minutes so that's

798
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,919
really good

799
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,919
um

800
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,760
so we we talked before about sort of

801
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,519
things that is

802
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,240
related to the basic sdf spec but it's

803
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,720
sort of extending it slightly

804
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,120
so a couple of topics has come up and

805
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,200
and this is the first one carson go

806
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,799
ahead

807
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,679
yeah so early in the development of sdf

808
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,159
we found out that

809
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,840
there is some

810
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,559
ecosystem specific information that

811
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,120
the ecosystems want to put into the sdf

812
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,399
model which

813
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,080
makes it hard to actually have

814
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,240
harmonized models

815
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,960
because each time an ecosystem starts to

816
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,039
use a harmonized model we would have to

817
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,640
add information

818
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,960
uh to to that

819
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,760
so

820
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,080
we thought that maybe it would be a good

821
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,240
thing to have a way

822
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,960
to do what the the

823
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,760
xml or html community does with sci

824
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,039
files

825
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,180
which are separate

826
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,960
[Music]

827
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,000
data that actually hook into the main

828
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,399
document in the html document or the xml

829
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,000
document in this case

830
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,799
and provide additional information

831
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,120
and we have discussed these for a while

832
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,960
and and have been thinking about

833
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,200
applying css concepts or something like

834
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,320
that to it

835
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,440
but actually it turns out that the the

836
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,360
what we need

837
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,519
seems to be much simpler

838
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,559
and

839
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,240
i have tried to write this up in a first

840
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,679
draft

841
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,840
before this meeting

842
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,240
so essentially the the processing model

843
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,799
here is that you can take a slim

844
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,399
harmonized model

845
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,760
plus

846
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,880
one or more mapping files and generate a

847
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,200
fat model

848
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,840
that has new qualities in them and that

849
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,440
that's really probably the part that

850
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,960
requires the

851
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,000
largest amount of thinking

852
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,679
so it's uh structurally still in sdf

853
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:54,640
spec

854
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
but it's not what you actually would

855
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,960
would harmonize in an organization like

856
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,640
1dm uh it just has information for from

857
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,399
one or more ecosystems

858
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,720
added to the base

859
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,440
harmonized specification

860
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,199
so a mapping file essentially would

861
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,040
start with the same info block and the

862
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,918
same namespace management

863
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,960
namespaces and default namespace

864
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,760
sections that you have in a normal sdf

865
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,719
spec

866
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,359
but the rest would just be a sequence of

867
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,480
pairs

868
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,560
or a map actually in the json object

869
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,040
that maps a joys adjacent pointer into

870
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,879
the sdf spec

871
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,239
to new qualities that would be added at

872
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,520
this point

873
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,839
um in in the spec

874
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,918
so it's like a set of editing

875
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,280
instructions

876
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,839
um except that the amount of editing you

877
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,918
can do is is limited

878
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,760
uh there

879
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,560
and that that's all pretty

880
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,800
obvious i mean this

881
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,680
should

882
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,720
work

883
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,480
very very easily

884
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,960
um there's just one problem these

885
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,240
qualities

886
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,680
may not be part of the sdf

887
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,800
language

888
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,880
so we want to have qualities in there

889
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,440
that are specific to ecosystems and next

890
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,560
slide

891
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,119
so here's an example where where we have

892
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,720
an ipso

893
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,880
mapping for for an sdf specification

894
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,440
and if so has these these object and

895
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,200
resource ids

896
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,480
um so

897
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,800
that's something that is really specific

898
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,880
to to ips so oma lightweight mtm

899
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,720
um so um it should really be the purview

900
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,440
of of those ecosystems to define these

901
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,359
additional qualities it should not be

902
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,160
something that they have to run to to

903
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,760
the asdf working group or

904
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,200
fill in a registry

905
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,400
with stuff each time

906
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
so apart from that

907
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,760
this looks

908
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,920
workable well it's a bit a little bit of

909
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,839
a pose

910
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,000
but maybe we can fix some of this

911
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,640
verbosity in the sdf compact

912
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,839
uh work so i'm optimistic that this is

913
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,680
possible

914
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,839
so next slide

915
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,920
we did the same thing for the web of

916
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,160
things

917
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,400
thing models

918
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,680
we didn't do it for the thing

919
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,160
descriptions obviously because that has

920
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,040
instance information which is a separate

921
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,520
item on our list today

922
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,400
and uh yeah we immediately fell into the

923
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,599
trap here

924
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,800
of using the wrong namespace because

925
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,400
the namespace

926
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,960
really should be the namespace of of the

927
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,960
model that we are uh

928
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,720
augmenting

929
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,240
and uh the the namespace that is listed

930
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,720
here is actually the one in which the

931
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,359
terms titles and descriptions are

932
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,760
defined because what already uses the

933
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,760
namespace system

934
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,760
so these are the qualities that we are

935
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,800
adding so web of things gives us kind of

936
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,720
a

937
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,079
direction in which we want to go here

938
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,240
so maybe we need to have

939
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,640
two different namespaces here one for

940
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,640
the qualities and

941
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,800
one for

942
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,760
the

943
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,599
pointers into the the spec

944
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,040
michael you were

945
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,079
at your microphone on

946
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,280
michael costner

947
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,399
okay

948
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,000
yeah so uh but my my diagnosis at the

949
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,400
moment is we haven't painted ourselves

950
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,560
in a corner yet

951
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,440
we we can make these mapping files work

952
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,800
and they can be

953
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,160
simple

954
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,760
um and uh the next step will be using

955
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,320
them in more

956
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,599
converters

957
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,839
so the yank converter for instance

958
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,839
currently dumps a lot of ecosystem

959
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,480
specific stuff into description

960
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,640
qualities

961
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,560
where it will be hard to

962
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,400
pass out again

963
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,280
and

964
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,040
it would be much better if it actually

965
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,880
generated a mapping

966
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,680
file

967
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,000
instead to keep this

968
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,760
gang-specific information

969
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,359
okay i think that's what i had

970
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,880
thank you kirsten so you mean that the

971
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,320
mapping files

972
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,000
in your experimentation without the

973
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,560
proposal is not breaking anything with

974
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,160
the main sdf spec

975
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,880
well

976
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,960
the the one thing where they touch the

977
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,119
main thing where they touch is

978
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,920
in the area of qualities

979
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,560
how do we maintain this quality space

980
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,359
and similar to

981
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,440
units where we have sdf defined values

982
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,560
and

983
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,960
other values we might want to do the

984
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,880
same thing for quality

985
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,720
names

986
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,400
so that that actually

987
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,160
changes the the data model of sdf

988
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,240
somewhat

989
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,839
but in in a limited way i think

990
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
it's

991
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,520
yeah

992
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,079
it still seems like i mean

993
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,040
if there is a bet to area

994
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,640
we need this kind of sort of semantic

995
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,240
information that's good to

996
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,920
keep in a in a consistent way

997
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,760
so maybe we should explore if there is a

998
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,560
way as you said to

999
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,200
to add it or change it yeah

1000
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,839
but okay um

1001
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,040
there is nothing here at least that

1002
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,960
prevents us from moving on with sdf

1003
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,079
specification asses

1004
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,640
yeah

1005
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,400
okay good

1006
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,520
any comments or questions

1007
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,440
i guess people are burnt out after a

1008
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,480
full week

1009
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,640
um

1010
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,400
then we move on

1011
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,440
uh who wants to speak to our islands

1012
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,760
um

1013
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,160
yeah we had a bitter problem because ari

1014
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,079
was supposed to present this and he had

1015
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,240
to drop at the last minute for from

1016
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,359
other

1017
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,839
non-work stuff i think uh so um

1018
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,599
um

1019
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,960
well let's see um i can maybe it's

1020
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,079
do you want to talk to it kirsten or

1021
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,319
i can well i can try

1022
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,800
yeah go ahead

1023
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,599
so

1024
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,599
given that that the

1025
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,839
world we are coming from here is is the

1026
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,200
hyper media

1027
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,000
world where we are describing things in

1028
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,910
in term terms of uh

1029
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,280
[Music]

1030
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,440
resources and links

1031
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
it's probably a good idea to think about

1032
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,520
how links would improve our situation in

1033
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,040
sdf

1034
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,240
and

1035
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,880
yeah looking at the the way we are using

1036
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,839
links we already have them in in sdf ref

1037
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,839
and so on but maybe we should have a

1038
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,760
little bit of a wider

1039
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,000
uh look at this and there are some of

1040
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,599
course some implicit links the

1041
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,839
parent-child relationship within the

1042
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,480
tree structure of the sdf

1043
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,000
specification that's obviously a form of

1044
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,280
link

1045
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,800
we can make explicit links in terms of

1046
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,680
cross references using sdf ref

1047
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,839
but these are very specific things

1048
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,480
because they mean we we do

1049
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,160
wholesale inclusion of of the target

1050
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,640
um of of the link

1051
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,520
um yeah so yeah next slide

1052
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,720
so

1053
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,880
maybe we want to

1054
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,000
be able to describe

1055
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,020
the fact that

1056
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,420
[Music]

1057
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,119
i'm always wanted wanting to say things

1058
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,000
but this is not the right word so so um

1059
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,839
concepts are linked in more interesting

1060
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,800
uh ways than just inclusion

1061
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,839
um and uh for instance the

1062
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,680
if we have a heater

1063
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,480
uh there's maybe a boiler somewhere that

1064
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,160
we we want to

1065
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,480
that has a temperature that we want to

1066
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,520
read of that boiler or if there is a

1067
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,079
switch a light switch then probably

1068
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,400
there is a light somewhere

1069
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,720
so these are

1070
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,400
definitions

1071
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,400
that describe

1072
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,359
relationships between instances

1073
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,240
but then these relationships in turn

1074
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,280
have

1075
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,640
properties

1076
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,440
that we may want to see at the glass

1077
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,560
level

1078
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,720
because a heater that that is meant to

1079
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,590
heat a boiler if you put that in into a

1080
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,440
[Music]

1081
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,240
pot for for cooking something that that

1082
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,400
might not work too well so you may want

1083
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,520
to put

1084
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,359
the information that this heater is

1085
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,520
actually supposed to have a link to a

1086
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,800
boiler

1087
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,400
into the definition

1088
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,200
so we we have links at the instance

1089
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,079
level that we want to describe

1090
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,240
at the class level but we also have

1091
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,200
links at the class level

1092
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,480
so

1093
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,040
we have to be really careful

1094
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,079
about

1095
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,560
what kind of link we are really talking

1096
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,720
about

1097
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,680
and

1098
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,440
when we have a link then of course you

1099
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,480
want to have a link relations

1100
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,839
with that

1101
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:02,079
that describe what this link is about

1102
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:02,800
and

1103
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,880
in the web world we have a link

1104
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,800
relations

1105
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,040
registry

1106
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,760
and that's essentially the predicate of

1107
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,640
an ontology if you look more closely

1108
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,599
at it and you may want to put in other

1109
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,079
information like cardinality

1110
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:21,200
and so on

1111
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,440
and what fits into the target position

1112
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,000
for the link and so on

1113
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,760
so let's look at the example on the next

1114
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,079
slide

1115
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,280
so

1116
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,800
here we have a robot arm

1117
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,200
that um

1118
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,960
is somehow highly related to some other

1119
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,839
uh robot arm so these arms

1120
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,599
are not just

1121
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,560
there

1122
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,280
and

1123
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,680
like shipping ships in the night

1124
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,400
but they need to know about each other

1125
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,920
um or at least that

1126
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,160
in this example arm a needs to know

1127
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,520
about arm b

1128
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,760
um so you want to be able to say that

1129
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,400
there is a relation here

1130
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,560
um to something that is of

1131
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,680
uh

1132
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,359
sdf type

1133
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:13,599
sdf thing robot arms sdf object rb

1134
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,079
so this is an example

1135
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,680
maybe mapping this to to sdf qualities

1136
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,720
isn't quite done right yet but it might

1137
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,280
might demonstrate what we mean here next

1138
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,599
slide

1139
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,319
so the the instance relations for

1140
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,079
instance might be a light switch

1141
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,520
controls a particular light

1142
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,960
and

1143
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,240
that relation is something like like a

1144
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,160
property

1145
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,480
in in some way but it's also an

1146
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,400
affordance you would exercise in a

1147
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,880
different way than a normal property so

1148
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,920
if you

1149
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,400
uh know the light switch is on or off

1150
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,599
that that's

1151
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,400
of a different quality

1152
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,359
um then um you know

1153
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,599
knowing what light that light switch

1154
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,520
actually is

1155
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,880
controlling

1156
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,520
so some of this is runtime information

1157
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,760
or instance information some of it is

1158
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,440
definition

1159
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,720
information

1160
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,760
and we we want to be able to describe

1161
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,440
these links

1162
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,000
and the the reason why this is all a

1163
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,599
little bit

1164
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,240
oppressing is that

1165
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,240
in lightweight m2m there are object

1166
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,079
links

1167
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,760
and these are runtime

1168
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,000
links and of course you want to be able

1169
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
to describe them

1170
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,040
in

1171
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,480
an sdf model next

1172
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:44,560
slide so we might have a property

1173
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,839
which is

1174
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,240
which light is being controlled by this

1175
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,400
light switch and it's of type

1176
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,440
link

1177
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,040
or we may want to

1178
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,960
model this as a new kind of affordance

1179
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,119
but in the end this this will look very

1180
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,720
similar to the previous

1181
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,200
example

1182
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,400
so next slide

1183
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,160
when we talk about instance information

1184
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,599
and i have to do a little bit of karaoke

1185
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,599
right now because i'm not entirely sure

1186
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,880
i understand what arya is talking about

1187
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,599
he sees two different approaches between

1188
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,839
himself and michael next slide

1189
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,160
so there are instance definitions

1190
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,280
uh which describe a specific

1191
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,599
object so

1192
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,280
for instance a web of things thing

1193
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,720
description is an instance different

1194
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,880
definition it's not a class definition

1195
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,000
sdf is about class definitions

1196
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,160
so in a thing description they didn't

1197
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,000
have to

1198
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,200
do the the intellectual work of

1199
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,960
separating

1200
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,280
out

1201
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,599
qualities that describe a specific

1202
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:02,160
instance and qualities that are

1203
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,680
similar enough between all these

1204
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,240
instances that you might want to put it

1205
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,839
into a

1206
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,000
class

1207
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
um

1208
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,160
yeah so um

1209
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,880
class kind type in since

1210
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,359
uh next slide um

1211
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,280
we we need to

1212
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,079
work

1213
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:22,880
uh

1214
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,200
on on the words we're using for for this

1215
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,119
there's only a limited number of english

1216
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,640
words and

1217
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,720
many of them have connotations or

1218
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,319
previous uses

1219
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:35,680
that make them difficult to use

1220
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,400
so if we have an sdf model which is a

1221
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,400
class

1222
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,200
do we maybe want to have a separate

1223
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,599
instance definition

1224
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,520
which somehow relates to this sdf model

1225
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,599
by the way this could look a lot like

1226
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,200
the mapping file

1227
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,839
i talked about again by adding qualities

1228
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:56,559
to

1229
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,359
the existing

1230
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,240
tree structure of the model

1231
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,319
so we could have

1232
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,440
the ability to give identities

1233
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,000
identifiers whatever

1234
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,319
two instances

1235
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,960
we could describe the the purpose of

1236
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,559
life relations between the instances

1237
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,640
um yeah i don't understand the last

1238
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,079
bullet uh

1239
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,079
of course you want to be able to to put

1240
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,160
all the qualities that are in what thing

1241
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,240
description into this instance

1242
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,359
definition

1243
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,240
it would just save us a lot of work

1244
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,660
because we can just use the the

1245
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,280
[Music]

1246
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,440
structures they already have

1247
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,040
defined

1248
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,160
so last slide in this deck instance sdf

1249
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,400
just a quick comment on yeah quick quick

1250
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,319
comment on this last line there i think

1251
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,000
the idea here was to have these

1252
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,559
instances or whatever we call them as

1253
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,880
not as which is a runtime instances that

1254
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,440
have a particular state

1255
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,040
so the instance r is talking mostly

1256
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,800
about here is this sort of instance

1257
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,280
without the current state

1258
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,640
yeah

1259
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,800
yeah it's not the actual

1260
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,559
digital twin it it's the definition

1261
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,000
of a specific

1262
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,359
happening

1263
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:16,720
so

1264
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,480
good

1265
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,680
yeah next slide yeah i'm trying to

1266
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,040
take her yeah

1267
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,359
okay

1268
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:26,559
so

1269
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,599
this looks almost the same like what we

1270
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,119
already had but

1271
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,880
the point is here now we have a specific

1272
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,680
uh

1273
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,000
name or id

1274
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,520
for the thing

1275
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,680
for the instance

1276
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,920
so the instance is is not an instance of

1277
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,319
a specific state of the thing which is

1278
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,160
yet another

1279
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,920
way of of

1280
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,800
going down one one turtle

1281
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,040
but it's it's the description of the

1282
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,200
instance so it's on the same level as

1283
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,920
what uh thing description

1284
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,440
and we would have the vocabulary here to

1285
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,839
do this

1286
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,440
okay i hope i haven't done this too much

1287
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,880
this service and the next one

1288
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,720
is the alternative view is michael's

1289
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,799
view so michael please go ahead

1290
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,880
so just right back on that last slide um

1291
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,960
is a good segue

1292
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,599
where he says uh instance of

1293
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,400
i think what the main difference between

1294
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,559
what ari would

1295
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,040
would was proposing and what i'm

1296
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,200
proposing and different approaches that

1297
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,880
not so different

1298
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,559
but when he says instance of i would

1299
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,119
just use sdf ref there because we're

1300
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,880
really bringing in that definition and

1301
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,359
we're using it to customize it so um

1302
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,520
next slide please okay so what i really

1303
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,359
see is that what we have are layered

1304
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,119
constraints on definitions you start

1305
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,200
with a base definition you refine it and

1306
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,200
compose it with others and you get

1307
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,119
reusability at all the levels and it's

1308
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,520
it's not clear whether it at any time

1309
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,079
really becomes an instance until it has

1310
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:06,960
a

1311
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,800
you know a protocol binding but in

1312
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,280
between there and to address what carson

1313
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,880
was saying what you need with relations

1314
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,319
and all and this is more than just

1315
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:16,079
breadcrumbs but what

1316
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:17,680
what seems to make sense is when you

1317
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,319
have reusable objects

1318
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:23,119
you could take all the trouble to

1319
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,440
go and classify them and name them and

1320
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,640
everything but really what you want to

1321
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,480
do is build an application graph out of

1322
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,760
reusable objects so you have an on off

1323
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,280
object but you want to use it for

1324
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,960
different things in its context and this

1325
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,960
context is going to be set by a graph

1326
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,800
that has other objects that relate to it

1327
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,559
in specific ways

1328
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,480
so you can either as carson said make a

1329
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,640
thing and make everything sub parts of

1330
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,240
the thing or do something that's a

1331
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,720
little more

1332
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,559
level and not so hierarchical and we

1333
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,599
find that

1334
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:52,960
very often we need to do the

1335
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,200
hierarchical thing and can't just make

1336
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,720
it all level

1337
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,160
because also we have to describe

1338
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,319
communication between things and and how

1339
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:01,680
they're connected not so much

1340
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,520
communication always in the digital form

1341
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,880
but how they're connected in the

1342
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,880
application graph so

1343
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,520
uh objects are connected and related

1344
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,760
and so this is a way to basically make

1345
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,160
your application graph portable and

1346
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,880
retargetable so i could cast it on to

1347
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,359
retarget it onto oma lightweight m2m

1348
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:22,319
objects just by filling in the object

1349
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:26,079
links to to at runtimes or at generation

1350
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:27,920
time when i generate the actual runtime

1351
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,760
thing and put protocol bindings in at

1352
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,440
that time i would generate the actual

1353
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,680
links and assign the namespace ids

1354
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,280
if i needed to if they weren't already

1355
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,079
done

1356
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,440
and then

1357
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,440
do the on the air schemas and protocol

1358
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,839
binding so i i don't see it any time it

1359
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:45,599
really becomes an instance until you

1360
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,640
actually

1361
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,200
give it a network address and and

1362
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,599
actually embody a state to it

1363
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,440
until then you're describing things that

1364
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,359
get closer to instances and it's more

1365
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:57,440
like layered constraints next slide

1366
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,760
please

1367
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:04,319
i'll just see questions at the end

1368
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:08,000
so um i wanted to also talk about

1369
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,920
a little bit about the language specific

1370
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,960
features that we're talking about and um

1371
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,480
what we only need to do is more than

1372
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,319
just breadcrumbs there are places where

1373
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,640
we need to use the

1374
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,760
json pointer to an sdf definition

1375
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,760
in specific ways that aren't just

1376
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,280
expanding it like sdf ref does

1377
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,400
but rather to use it in relations and in

1378
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,160
the composition that i was just talking

1379
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,359
about

1380
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:37,359
to build application graphs so

1381
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,839
really sdf is the best thing you know

1382
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,599
the dependency here on our our first

1383
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,119
release would be do we really want to

1384
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,440
keep calling it sdf ref because sdf ref

1385
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,359
from doesn't really

1386
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:49,760
capture the meaning in my opinion and we

1387
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,680
really need to think about whether we

1388
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,160
want to say sdf expand or something like

1389
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,359
that and you know we have this

1390
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,440
discussion and you know maybe it's too

1391
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,480
late and we can't really rename sdf ref

1392
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,920
but really if there is a last

1393
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,520
opportunity

1394
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,880
it's now and the window is going to

1395
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,200
close with 1.2 so

1396
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,720
it's kind of too bad we already use it

1397
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,960
so much but actually i think it might

1398
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,599
make sense to use sdf ref for the thing

1399
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:16,319
that

1400
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:17,280
is

1401
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,839
does not do expansion and invent a new

1402
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:21,599
term for the one that does but we need

1403
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,760
more discussion on this

1404
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,559
next slide please

1405
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,960
okay another feature the semantic links

1406
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,880
is i see them they're semantic links

1407
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,119
they're subject predicate object triples

1408
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,040
and you know their web links work that

1409
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,240
way too

1410
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,400
so subject is though always pretty much

1411
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,920
the present definition we don't

1412
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,520
necessarily need a context override or

1413
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,440
quads or anything like that but what we

1414
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,480
do need

1415
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,799
is the predicates and then the objects

1416
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:51,359
that can be an sdf pointer which is one

1417
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,040
behavior to

1418
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,200
semantically define the relationship one

1419
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,280
sdf object to another and sometimes if

1420
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,079
you're

1421
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,240
for example lightweight m2m

1422
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,319
you just need to constrain what kind of

1423
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,799
objects you can point to when you uh

1424
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,240
when you build your

1425
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,920
um

1426
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,599
instance graph

1427
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,520
your implementation

1428
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,680
so a lot of it is is uh

1429
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,000
using these references in links but but

1430
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,520
wanting to be able to describe it with a

1431
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,200
predicate that says you know

1432
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,920
target type or something like that right

1433
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,079
so also they can be external references

1434
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,799
though that are just any old uri so we

1435
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,640
want to be able to integrate with rdf

1436
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,720
using this pattern as well

1437
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,759
uh next slide please

1438
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,040
i think this is the last part i'm afraid

1439
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,440
we're kind of running out of time here

1440
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,839
i know i think this is the last one um

1441
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:46,480
okay so protocol binding yeah this is

1442
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,599
just okay carson already covered this

1443
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,480
so this is basically um but i wanted to

1444
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,240
say one thing is that i did an

1445
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,280
experiment where i i used the web of

1446
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,960
things protocol binding vocabulary

1447
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,520
as a sdf extension

1448
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,760
using the vocabulary extension technique

1449
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,760
similar to what almost identical to what

1450
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,319
carson showed earlier and then used that

1451
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:14,880
to generate tds and that was i found

1452
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,599
that to use it as an annotation on sdf

1453
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,359
and then use it in the generations to be

1454
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,200
very good workflow i think that's the

1455
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,880
last slide can you see if there's one

1456
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,680
more no that's the last one i'm done

1457
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,760
then i'm done okay

1458
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,200
thank you very much

1459
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,279
any super quick questions of this

1460
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,079
i just wanted to say let's have an

1461
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,480
interim where we go into any detail but

1462
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,119
yes quick questions carson

1463
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,079
yeah

1464
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:42,960
i think

1465
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,880
i look at these lines and we're not sure

1466
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,720
whether we were talking about the same

1467
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,359
thing but i'm now convinced that we have

1468
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,760
a pretty pretty close direction

1469
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,280
common direction maybe with the

1470
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,359
exception of whether we want to reuse

1471
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:57,760
that jump sdf ref

1472
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,559
which

1473
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,000
we kind of

1474
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,480
inherited from jason schema.org

1475
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,480
and renamed slightly but we should have

1476
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,480
renamed it more radically

1477
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,640
but apart from that i think we have very

1478
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,520
similar ideas and i think that the what

1479
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,359
thing description is is really a nice

1480
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:14,480
benchmark

1481
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,839
uh that we can use here because it is at

1482
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:20,319
the instance level and we can

1483
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:23,119
make sure that that the the levels of

1484
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,599
turtles we we built here

1485
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:28,319
actually is able to reach down to that

1486
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,160
thing description so let's have that

1487
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,559
interim

1488
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:35,200
okay thank you and um

1489
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,040
that was the last of our presentations i

1490
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,680
think that actually segues quite nicely

1491
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,040
to your

1492
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,160
setting up the next interims uh michael

1493
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,720
michael rich or something

1494
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,640
i gave you two seconds

1495
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,680
into the channel uh into the jabber and

1496
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,880
into the minutes uh a doodle poll for uh

1497
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,160
virtual interims in december january and

1498
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,520
february

1499
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,400
um

1500
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,880
so we'll pick one not not uh sorry we're

1501
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,799
gonna pick three values from that that

1502
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:06,880
there are several weeks and i believe if

1503
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,119
i'm not mistaken i have picked the hour

1504
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,599
before the one dm meeting which i

1505
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,680
recognize is early for michael koster

1506
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,920
and the hour afterwards

1507
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,720
um which is now getting into late in

1508
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,000
europe um on the monday or the tuesday

1509
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,240
of several weeks in each month so please

1510
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,400
pick uh them appropriately assuming that

1511
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,640
we will pick uh three

1512
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,200
uh values in there and uh it sounds like

1513
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,280
we really want a december meeting a

1514
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,960
virtual interim

1515
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,680
um and that we possibly might cancel or

1516
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,079
skip january depending on how well we're

1517
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,079
doing with shepherding and other things

1518
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,760
but that we absolutely want a february

1519
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,319
virtual interim to deal with any issues

1520
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:48,319
arising from a possible working group

1521
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:50,559
last call that might have occurred after

1522
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:51,440
the

1523
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,119
occurred in january

1524
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,880
um

1525
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,920
and

1526
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,079
uh we had previously done 90-minute

1527
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,599
meetings i think we should try to stick

1528
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,359
to more frequent 60 minutes um and get

1529
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:05,920
right into things

1530
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,359
yes but

1531
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:09,599
and yeah go ahead with the quite the

1532
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,359
milestone review part from the last

1533
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,920
three minutes or one minute we have left

1534
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,040
yeah i lost well two seconds right um

1535
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:17,920
just

1536
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,880
a quick thing here uh milestone review

1537
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,960
we are um

1538
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,040
developing sdf according to milestone we

1539
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,400
are slightly we're supposed to be

1540
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,960
sending it on on in september

1541
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,799
we are on track but with a slight delay

1542
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:32,000
of course

1543
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,920
and during this work well identified

1544
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,520
additional interesting work like the one

1545
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,599
we just discussed on on protocol

1546
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:38,920
mappings and

1547
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,440
relationships and instances

1548
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,960
and we need to figure out whether that

1549
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,680
fits within the big document a simple

1550
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,160
extension so that or whether we actually

1551
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,319
need to have more complicated extensions

1552
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:51,920
uh which would

1553
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,240
then sort of be beyond the scope of of

1554
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,680
the asdf group uh but if that happens we

1555
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,520
will start looking at the sort of need

1556
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,799
to recharter

1557
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,240
and of course we would also like to be

1558
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,240
around uh long enough to that we could

1559
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:04,960
have

1560
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,359
at least one face-to-face meeting during

1561
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:10,440
the lifetime

1562
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,839
having never seen anybody right

1563
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:15,200
that would be there that would be a

1564
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,680
first right but yeah thank you thank you
