1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,759
uh i have a m1 mac mini

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,240
super happy with it it's

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,880
it goes faster than my octa-core intel

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,280
laptop but i'm shocked at how fast it

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,600
goes um yeah

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,680
anyway i upgraded the latest

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,640
yeah

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,640
that's good to hear that my my wife got

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,480
it we haven't gotten it yet but we

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,920
ordered a 10 core uh mac pro 14 inch

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,640
for her she has like a she has like a

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,719
nine-year-old laptop

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,760
so there's a column in there

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,200
there was a column in the new york times

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
yesterday about how uh how great that

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,719
processor is like really the new york

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,239
times is like

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,800
having fanboy articles about cpus okay

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,399
i think it might be bleed over because

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,000
there i think there is a fanboy at new

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,520
york times on apple so

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,000
uh anything to say anything good i guess

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,039
but yeah

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,559
all right well we're at seven so you

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,320
should probably stop chatting about

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,199
laptops right and i see uh ying's ends

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,640

jen's online too she's been for a while

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,320

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,040
okay yeah um okay

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,040
yep

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,280

buenos dias for those of you who are

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,680

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,360
pining for madrid

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,119
uh and happy veterans day

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,000
this is the note well i know you've seen

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,840
it a lot in the other ones

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,400
the crux of it is uh

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,560
you need to

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,320
comply with all these

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,759
ietf rules including uh

43
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,840
declaration of any ipr you know about

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,960
related

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,759
to work in the ietf

46
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,000
and your attendance of the meeting

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,479
constitutes participation

48
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,079
the other one people have asked to call

49
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,799
out is the kona code of conduct i don't

50
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,799
think we've had too much problems with

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,880
that out of the uh

52
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,280
out of our working group uh we haven't

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,399
had

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,240
but um that's also where we're go we're

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,759
uh

56
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,160
obliged to treat everybody with respect

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,680
we have a few rfcs

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,400
the

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,000
the 9088 9089 are kind of germane to one

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,319
that's being proposed later in the

61
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,520
session so that's interesting

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,440
these are just waiting on a decision on

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,400
whether to wait for the bfd yang biz

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,080
that's nine rfc 91 27 there's a long

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
conversation going on the yang doctors

66
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,239
but they should publish

67
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,840
oh i would hope in the next couple

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,319
months even if we wait for the bfd yang

69
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,440
biz because it's uh it's a very short uh

70
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,239
very small change to the i don't know uh

71
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,080
ac i'm not sure if we have anybody

72
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,360
that's uh

73
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,120
vision impaired but

74
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,239
that's uh

75
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,440
what you were just talking about are

76
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,440
young data models for ospf and the young

77
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,599
data model for isis

78
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,800
oh right right right okay sorry yes data

79
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,760
models the base the base models the 100

80
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,840
plus page uh

81
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
documents on which all the other gaming

82
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,760
documents are are augment

83
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,640
this one's pretty much done the in the

84
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,400
encoding isis encodings for srv6

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,879
we're waiting on flex algorithm and a

86
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,399
spring document on oem

87
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
i'm not going to say anything about the

88
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,440
only one i'm going to say something

89
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,159
about is the flex algorithm

90
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,239
we had some changes to that we had an

91
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,080
errata for the

92
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,760
extended attributes isis and ospf drafts

93
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,640
that's 89 20 and 89 19 those rfcs

94
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,480
and um

95
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,319
now that it's finally through the second

96
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,720
working group last call it's waiting on

97
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,280
john to review

98
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,920
chris the reverse metric it's in i is it

99
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,760
still in ietf last call that kind of

100
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
completed without any

101
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,720
uh i know i think i got a

102
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,560
i think john might have sent me some

103
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,159
review comments so i filled him out and

104
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,799
i think we just pushed forward on that

105
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,680
okay good is that the case john i sent

106
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,000
you review comments you um

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,680
you took care of them

108
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,639
then i went to uh ietf last call

109
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,360
uh the ietf last call is probably

110
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,120
finished by now but i have that on my

111
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,360
list of things to check up on but it's

112
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,040
uh

113
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,680
presumably um if the last call hadn't

114
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,880
finished already

115
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,160
it'll be finished by the end of this

116
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,680
week and we can kick it on to the next

117
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,800
step

118
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,800
great

119
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,560
we got these two sr yang models ospf sr

120
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,840
and isis these are augmentations to the

121
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,840
base i don't put i'm not i wouldn't put

122
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,919
too high a priority on these until we

123
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,919
get the base done i mean we can like we

124
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,080
can start definitely start the process

125
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,240
though

126
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
the distinction of these drafts the last

127
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,440
drafts

128
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,840
that don't have lsr last working group

129
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,479
graphs that don't have lsr in the title

130
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,560
from when we merged the working groups

131
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,919
about five years ago

132
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,560
i'm not going to say anything

133
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,440
we're gonna cover what what's that chris

134
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,080
it was five years ago that's wow uh

135
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,520
something like anyway

136
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,680
yeah

137
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,520
we're gonna cover uh flood reduction

138
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,120
today

139
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,160
i won't say anything

140
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,560
bfd strict mode that's been

141
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,080
implemented it's pretty simple draft i

142
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,520
think we could we could go through this

143
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,560
one actually pretty quickly

144
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,120
and

145
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,199
this is one we hope to get done because

146
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,280
we have the isi sitting waiting uh

147
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,080
waiting for miss refs refs so we'd

148
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,759
really like to get the ospf v3

149
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,639
extensions for srv6 done

150
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,319
the offers told me they're going to have

151
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,319
a update soon

152
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,000
i'm not going to say anything much about

153
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,600
any of these

154
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,919
we have a lot of working group documents

155
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,520
so we have

156
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,360
but we should really focus on that

157
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,720
rather than taking on new work

158
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,440
uh

159
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,120
we have a

160
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,400
only one i'm going to say anything about

161
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,319
is the flexible bandwidth delay and

162
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,800
constraints there was a

163
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,759
there was a discussion on the asla that

164
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,400
never completed and today i mean

165
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,720
that the generic metric

166
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,039
uh we didn't really get through that

167
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,960
discussion on the list

168
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,280
but there's a now there's a new proposal

169
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,560
for asla bit hopefully we can discuss

170
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,199
whether that can resolve the controversy

171
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,720
with the generic metric

172
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,120
and

173
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,160
okay we have these two documents the

174
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,520
prefix unreachable announcement and

175
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,800
passive interface that's going to be

176
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,720
covered today as well

177
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,880
and so is the flooding draft

178
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,840
and

179
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,800
um

180
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,199
i don't have anything to say about these

181
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,840
documents

182
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,520
okay

183
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
anything yeah chris on any of the work

184
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
we need to do or anything i think one

185
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,039
thing i would like to say is i think we

186
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,960
should focus on getting since we have

187
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,479
all these working group documents is

188
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,479
getting some of these done

189
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,560
as opposed to getting new taking on new

190
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,240
work

191
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,759
yeah so uh

192
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,199
let's flip back can you flip back to the

193
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,360
existing working group documents

194
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,039
certainly

195
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,680
um page one i guess one of three

196
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,199
yeah so i'm curious um

197
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,120
you know we have all these experimental

198
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,240
ones

199
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,240
do any of the authors

200
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,960
uh of any of these have to can they

201
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,840
report like has it been deployed

202
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,440
is anyone using them are they being

203
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,000
experimented with

204
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,639
um i guess the question would go out to

205
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,120
wemo tony

206
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,520
um

207
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,199
what was the other one i guess the other

208
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,080
one was flood uh reflector which

209
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,520
presented today but yes can be presented

210
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,440
that one has been implemented in

211
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,159
discussions i did her expense review on

212
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,360
that one

213
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,460
is tony lee here

214
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,399
[Music]

215
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,360
no

216
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,799
okay shoot

217
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,838
is wemo here

218
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,080
no

219
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,519
okay well we're not gonna hear anything

220
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,240
about those then ah okay

221
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,600
yeah so uh i guess then the uh

222
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,120
i wonder if there's anything else we

223
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,839
could say

224
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,040
no

225
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,519
to see if we could push some of these

226
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,480
through

227
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,320
i mean are they are any of these blocked

228
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,480
on us

229
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,680
does anybody know uh if any of these are

230
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,440
uh blocked on us these working group

231
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,040
documents

232
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
if you want to say hey look pay

233
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,320
attention to mine you guys need to do

234
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,399
this

235
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,320
let me look at let me look at

236
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,959
anybody else ask for uh

237
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,120
the reverse metric

238
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,640
uh they've asked for uh

239
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,839
i mean they've said it's ready for

240
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,440
working group last call you know it's

241
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,800
just uh

242
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,240
the oas ospf corollary to the existing

243
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,880
ice isis rfc

244
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,120
uh

245
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,600
yeah okay let's do that done

246
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,640
anybody

247
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,240
not none of the other ones that really

248
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,120
they really asked uh for working for a

249
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,560
glass call

250
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,640
and there hasn't been much discussion on

251
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,600
on on the list on as we get further on

252
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,519
yep okay then i don't have anything else

253
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,880
so let's see i will so it's flood

254
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,959
reflection if you stop

255
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,600
i stop sharing flat

256
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,240
slides tony tony p

257
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,040
can you find that little document icon

258
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,240
oh no

259
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,079
there's a flooding speed first sorry i'm

260
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,959
sorry okay is it lesser bruno you are

261
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,600
you presenting less or bruno

262
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,160
presenting

263
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,640
your slides

264
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,839
yeah can you hear me

265
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,480
yes yeah i'll be presenting uh

266
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,480
yes if you click on the little document

267
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,079
i clicked on the little document

268
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,399
i don't see anything that i don't see

269
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,920
anything that allows me to select

270
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,079
i stopped sharing so you should be able

271
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,480
to it doesn't let me

272
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,399
i'll share my screen and i'll i'll show

273
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,560
you what it looks like just in case

274
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,760
um let's see so

275
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,200
it's

276
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,600
right here this guy is that the one you

277
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,720
clicked on

278
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,480
yes

279
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,320
oh man

280
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,279
okay well oh it says all the slots

281
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,800
immediate oh

282
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,480
okay so maybe it pops something up on

283
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,519
your screen but you can't see it

284
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,920
um

285
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,320
that makes it difficult oh i had to grip

286
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,480
i found

287
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,839
automatically had access to share

288
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,279
can you click the green thing it's

289
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,320
saying already granted

290
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,359
on him and q

291
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,320
oh i have to quit the screen share okay

292
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,040
now try again

293
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,160
all right

294
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,519
it's roll based access control

295
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,480
yeah

296
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,720
uh my audio i'm getting is fuzzy is

297
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,040
anybody else getting that i mean i might

298
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,839
re reset my audio

299
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,920
that sounds fine to me chris

300
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,720
okay i'll reset that go ahead les

301
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,000
all right

302
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,800
um okay so this is an update

303
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,680
on

304
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,399
fast flooding

305
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,959
we've now produced a merged draft there

306
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,519
were formerly two drafts

307
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,560
and so we have lots of authors

308
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,800
i hope we'll be able to keep that many

309
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,040
authors going forward since everybody's

310
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,760
contributed

311
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,160
so you're telling me i can move the

312
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,120
slides by

313
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,680
doing what

314
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,200
click and arrow

315
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,040
your arrow keys oh i see

316
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,720
i see i see i have the numbers okay

317
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,639
so in september uh the authors of these

318
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,639
two drafts which we've been talking

319
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,639
about for some time now

320
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,440
agreed to produce a combined draft

321
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,680
that was i believe just before the

322
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,519
interim meeting that we had on this

323
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,839
topic

324
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,560
we have

325
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,279
we had consensus on

326
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,279
there are many congestion control

327
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,360
algorithms that are possible

328
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,519
because they're implemented on the dx

329
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,959
side

330
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,638
so it's not necessary for

331
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,079
oh

332
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,959
it's bigger now cool

333
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,639
it's not necessary

334
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,639
that every node implement the same

335
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,240
congestion control algorithm

336
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,399
there is also a flow control aspect

337
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,959
depending upon what approach you take

338
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,199
and for flow control we do need

339
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,760
some tlvs

340
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,639
for

341
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,839
that have to be supported for

342
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,560
interoperability

343
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,320
and we've been debating back and forth

344
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,519
for some time about which approach

345
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,880
is better

346
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,000
and we've basically decided we don't

347
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,920
have to make that choice at this point

348
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,760
what we want to do is

349
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,600
to support

350
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,560
experimental work going forward in terms

351
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,600
of

352
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,040
how the algorithms are working and

353
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,360
that's what we've been talking about

354
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,320
i think the last couple of idfs

355
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,839
and so the best way forward is to

356
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,760
produce a combined draft that provides

357
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,240
the tools so

358
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,760
implementers can

359
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,880
do what they think is best and we'll see

360
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,360
how the

361
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,199
you know what what what what the

362
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,360
performance of the algorithms turns out

363
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,680
to be and whether we can settle on one

364
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,639
or whether we'll just simply allow for

365
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,760
multiple in the future

366
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,720
so this is not a technical presentation

367
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,240
this is

368
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,839
basically just a

369
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,199
a quick overview of the combined draft

370
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,360
content

371
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,320
and i've done this basically by picking

372
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,839
the

373
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,680
key sections in the document and

374
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,600
describing the content that's in these

375
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,440
sections

376
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,519
so we have a section an introductory

377
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,800
section and

378
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,639
the discussion of historical behavior

379
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,320
historically we've

380
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,040
flooded at 33 lsps per second or

381
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,519
thereabouts

382
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,760
and this talks about the goals of faster

383
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,959
flooding

384
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,560
which is something that

385
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,440
we

386
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,759
we all pretty much agreed upon

387
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,600
so we took some text from both of the

388
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,759
drafts

389
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,480
as this was again a point of consensus

390
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,160
there really weren't any significant

391
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,399
issues in

392
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,680
putting this text together

393
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,279
section 4 discusses a new flooding

394
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,680
parameters tlv

395
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,560
which

396
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,519
now contains six candidate sub tlvs

397
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,560
the first two already were present in

398
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,880
draft ukraine

399
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,440
although we've renamed them a bit and

400
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,920
we introduced four new ones

401
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,199
which

402
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,720
were related to

403
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,839
uh

404
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,480
things that the you know one or

405
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,480
or the other algorithm

406
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,839
was making use of

407
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,560
section 5 talks about some

408
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,360
performance improvements that are needed

409
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
on the receiver

410
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,600
particularly

411
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,040
acknowledging

412
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,560
lsps

413
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,320
more quickly than

414
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,160
implementations may have

415
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,639
historically have been doing

416
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,759
and

417
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,000
perhaps prioritizing

418
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,079
the reception of

419
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,320
snps on receive

420
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,639
to assist in

421
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,240
providing faster acknowledgements

422
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,480
section 6

423
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,959
contains the description of the two

424
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,079
algorithms that have been discussed

425
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,520
separately in the in the different

426
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,240
documents in the past

427
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,400
so section 6.2

428
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,199
is the algorithm from draft ukraine um

429
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,919
the description has been updated

430
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,119
uh

431
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,720
6.3 is the algorithm from draft ginsburg

432
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,600
that description has also been updated

433
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,400
but they're they're fundamentally

434
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,240
you know the the same two algorithms

435
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,760
that were previously in separate

436
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,760
documents

437
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,200
and we added

438
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,240
an appendix to track changes

439
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,840
and another appendix to track open

440
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,520
issues at the present time there are no

441
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,720
open issues we managed to resolve

442
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,320
all of the open issues that we had

443
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,600
during the

444
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,760
discussion of putting together the

445
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,160
combined draft

446
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
but we'll use that to track issues in

447
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,640
the future

448
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,080
and

449
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,840
now we'd like to request working group

450
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,160
adoption this has been discussed uh

451
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,799
probably for a couple years now

452
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,440
um and we'd like to to move forward with

453
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,960
with the work

454
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,840
and

455
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,039
you know we will

456
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,840
you know the respective teams are still

457
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,360
uh doing

458
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,000
implementation and testing and there'll

459
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,679
be further reports and update to the

460
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,520
draft in the future

461
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,760
i think the most important point here is

462
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,440
if we can get quick working group

463
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,559
adoption

464
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,080
then we can get

465
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,480
an early allocation for the tlv code

466
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,440
point

467
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,520
which we need

468
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,520
to move forward with the work

469
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,080
that's it

470
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,080
i guess

471
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,960
something happened to the audio

472
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,559
you see we started to hear your voice

473
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,120
and then it cut off after i guess

474
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,880
okay okay yeah uh i think we're gonna

475
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,960
we're definitely gonna do given the

476
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,320
interest and the

477
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,240
you know the the number of meetings

478
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,039
we've had on this this has been probably

479
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,840
the most discussed topic on uh working

480
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,360
group list for a long time we're going

481
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,840
to do working group adoption

482
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,919
immediately the one question is whether

483
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:34,880
we do

484
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,320
standard tracker

485
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,600
experimental i think

486
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,160
we'll we'll we'll uh we'll

487
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,919
include that in adoption

488
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,600
we're kind of running short in time we

489
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,840
didn't

490
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,559
we didn't

491
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,520
allocate that much time for this but i

492
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,840
mean but we'll do that shortly after the

493
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,960
itf

494
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,840
the adoption call

495
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,960
but anyway good work i mean to everybody

496
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,240
on the design

497
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,720
on on both of the drafts and

498
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,960
uh the discussion and i i

499
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,600
i read it looks ready for adoption

500
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,280
i i'll probably have some more comments

501
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,918
but purely editorial

502
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,559
i don't see anybody else in the queue i

503
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,960
guess we can go on to the next

504
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,280
presentation tony you want to put yours

505
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,000
load your slides hit the or less can you

506
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,480
stop sharing and tony you want to share

507
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,879
yeah let's try this experiment

508
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:46,840
all

509
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,799
right

510
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,480
pushing something

511
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,159
um

512
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,760
okay do it do it again i think i

513
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,720
let's see

514
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,960
well look it looks even uh

515
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,280
i granted him i had to reboot my machine

516
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,480
apparently

517
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,250
okay

518
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,120
[Music]

519
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,960
yeah look at this

520
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,320
something works

521
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,679
um

522
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,480
yes so pdf you don't really see the

523
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,919
title doesn't matter

524
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,559
anyway it's the update on what's going

525
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,880
on with the flat reflection draft uh

526
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,840
version four

527
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,840
okay

528
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,640
uh so yeah four came out that was based

529
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,480
on some discussions and implementation

530
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,720
deployment experience uh things

531
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,559
especially to ac who really find

532
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,640
competitive stuff i don't think how much

533
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,880
was on the list how much was actually

534
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,120
authors they see

535
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,039
so you know multiple sections have been

536
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,840
changed clarified added so substantially

537
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,960
nothing changed but a lot of

538
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,720
clarification has been put into the

539
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,960
document

540
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,360
more detailed changes so glossary always

541
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,799
a nice thing

542
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,799
and then um

543
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,600
we broke out and clarified the section

544
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,919
about the two deployment modes which you

545
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,840
know we call no tunnel deployment so

546
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,520
basically no shortcuts

547
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,240
and l1 tunnel deployment so basically

548
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,159
you shortcut the thing

549
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,240
with full or partial mesh of l1

550
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,400
shortcuts and you use

551
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,960
basically the tunnels as next tops

552
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,840
um

553
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,400
what we also throw in based on

554
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,919
already you know discussion about some

555
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,039
future stuff and implementation um

556
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,000
experience we threw in the tunnel type

557
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
discovery because so far there was only

558
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,159
discovery

559
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,039
uh

560
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,520
of whether you know where the end points

561
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,440
are and who is doing what role but there

562
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,200
was no description what kind of tunnel

563
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,880
can you set up if you want to set up

564
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,360
automatic tunnel and thankfully now we

565
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,320
have the rfc 9012 which deals in extent

566
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,880
with extensive inexpensive detail with

567
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,120
the subject uh so the uh acceptable

568
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
tunnel end points including the caps and

569
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,039
all the other you know just that you

570
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,720
need to get it done

571
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,320
are being

572
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,520
announced

573
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,400
and a flag basically shows up where the

574
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,880
the end point is uh flood reflector

575
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,799
adjacency or an l1 shortcut end point um

576
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,320
and of course you know you can run the

577
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,480
stuff just fine with statically

578
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,240
configured tunnels or any you know

579
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,640
tunnel solution that that you prefer to

580
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,360
you know this auto discovered stuff

581
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,000
all right um

582
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,520
even more detail

583
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,480
um that's mostly implementation um and

584
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,080
deployment feedback

585
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,520
uh

586
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,720
the master of multiplicities of tlvs has

587
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,760
been moved mostly to shoot and the

588
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,760
violation should be locked and clarified

589
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,600
and only the first you know instance

590
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,120
should be used i think it was based

591
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,279
maybe even on aces comments

592
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,120
the other interesting thing is that we

593
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,960
added the sub tlbs uh for discovery of

594
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,760
uh

595
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,600
the different roles and the tunneling

596
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,400
points we uh moved that

597
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,919
not only in l1 but also into l2 as uh

598
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:04,960
adva

599
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,400
advertisement as the scope of

600
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,760
advertisement

601
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,039
um

602
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,799
that's simply based on the observation

603
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,440
that some people desire to run it with

604
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,080
underneath not having isis l1 but

605
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,080
possibly something else so the

606
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,960
advertisement cannot fly in uh l1 they

607
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,720
should fly in l2

608
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,400
um

609
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,480
then um

610
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,640
isis metric on all flood reflector

611
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,799
adjacency should be uniform that's

612
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,880
basically from deployment

613
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,279
they don't have to be but it will save

614
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,360
you potential a lot of trouble if you

615
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,640
keep you know the flood reflector

616
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,440
adjacency is uniform in terms of the

617
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,279
metric distances

618
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,080
um

619
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,720
then again deployment and implementation

620
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,520
it wasn't entirely clear that within an

621
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,480
area

622
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,400
isis area the cluster id should be

623
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,159
uniform

624
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,360
um

625
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,520
that does not prevent you technically to

626
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,240
run multiple cluster in an area

627
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,200
um

628
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,360
but it still prevents i mean it was

629
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,960
pretty clear in the draft but on the

630
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,559
implementation experience you know we

631
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,880
pointed that stuff we made it even more

632
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,200
clear that a single client has to use

633
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,520
the same cluster id so

634
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,039
the only way he can interact with

635
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,840
another cluster would be for a normal

636
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,679
l2 adjacency with another client in

637
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,400
another cluster

638
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
and we clarified also that the cluster

639
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,720
id is used to actually check adjacency

640
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,880
formation uh if you decide to be you

641
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,840
know a client or a reflector

642
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,159
um

643
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,880
right so um

644
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,640
old ants so yes this is implemented and

645
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,679
in deployment um what we see is that the

646
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,000
numbers in terms of additional

647
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,799
scalability you can get with it are

648
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,720
pretty much what we expected based on

649
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,480
kind of simulation theoretical work

650
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
thinking through the stuff before

651
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,360
implementation

652
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,640
and we also see that

653
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,200
it does not require forklift of the

654
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,520
network but you can actually move over

655
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,080
without losing capacity so basically one

656
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,880
node at a time if you do it correctly

657
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,640
um

658
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,400
technically speaking or in terms of

659
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,080
substance there were no significant

660
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,919
changes right except all this

661
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,600
clarification work that i uh pointed out

662
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,760
and i think again that this is ready for

663
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,559
last call uh i do not think we'll have

664
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,400
any substantial

665
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,240
additions or changes um

666
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,559
and currently ongoing work which is

667
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,440
already spinning out of it is the bgpls

668
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,320
which is of course the next thing um

669
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,799
that is needed that has been introduced

670
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,000
in idr uh this meeting jordan is doing

671
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,679
most of this work there

672
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,039
and

673
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,480
we're also starting on auto flood

674
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,360
reflection um which is the same thing is

675
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,000
auto evpn in rift which basically means

676
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,799
that

677
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,360
you can bootstrap uh routers without any

678
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,159
configuration whatsoever and you end up

679
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,320
if you build uh something also variation

680
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,000
of the claw network you

681
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,559
end up with a fully configured claw uh

682
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,799
plus uh the flood reflection already

683
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,799
automatically being configured on top of

684
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,679
it

685
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,320
um that's the last one that i have i

686
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,600
think yes

687
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,520
so from my side

688
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,279
or from the other side the outstanding

689
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,960
request is to go with this thing for a

690
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,120
last call and see whether more things

691
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,159
pop up

692
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,000
if anybody has implementation wants to

693
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,399
interrupt and so one and so on as usual

694
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,960
uh pretty welcome implementation is

695
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,360
relatively simple

696
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,960
uh from our experience um so

697
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,159
no highly encouraged

698
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,960
thanks i'm done

699
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,039
um

700
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,399
so with a

701
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,080
contributor hat on at the chair hat uh

702
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,840
i reread the draft yesterday and had a

703
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,000
couple of uh thoughts

704
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,640
have you considered um

705
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,240
you know uh one of the obvious ways to

706
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,120
deploy it is with the with the um

707
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,240
tunnels uh between the l1 l2s

708
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,520
for forwarding

709
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
um

710
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,000
have you considered like just

711
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,080
they automatically working you know like

712
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,080
they're auto setup not even signaled at

713
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,000
all but you know just because of the

714
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,360
fact that they're

715
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,200
once they join up with the reflector

716
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,279
then they just

717
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,200
you know they can program themselves to

718
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,640
accept

719
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,799
um encapsulated traffic from the other

720
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,080
clients

721
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,159
yeah right so that's what the discovery

722
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,880
pld is there for

723
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,960
okay so i didn't when i read you know i

724
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,039
just read it i didn't get that you know

725
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,559
there wasn't anything sort of saying it

726
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,320
you don't have to signal this i thought

727
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,720
it was talking about signaling it but

728
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,240
um well depend what we think uh

729
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,200
uh of signaling but basically what

730
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,320
happens is you send these discovery sub

731
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,399
tlds which tell the others what the

732
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,520
roles are

733
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,159
and you can optionally and

734
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,200
add to that sub sub plds which describes

735
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,520
the tunnel end point and say look this

736
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,960
is the tunnel end point for the front

737
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,080
reflector adjacency or for a shortcut

738
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,000
and then there is basically a simple

739
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,760
explanation what's the tie breaking who

740
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,720
is initiating right and based on that

741
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
the tunnels can be automatically set up

742
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,799
but something has to set up the tunnels

743
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,720
unless you support it you know

744
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,399
aesthetically pre-provision tunnels

745
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,960
which we also support and i don't see

746
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,520
much more to be done there

747
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,880
no that i mean that's what i was

748
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,600
thinking though is that not even

749
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,120
like if if you knew who the other

750
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,200
clients were you could automatically as

751
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,279
as a receiver right you could you could

752
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,960
set up

753
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,480
yeah but that's what's happening right

754
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,200
so in l1 you will see all the other guys

755
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,120
and they will show up as clients in the

756
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,120
same cluster id and they will show up

757
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,799
the shortcut endpoint so you cannot

758
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,039
build up those tunnels to them

759
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,480
that's what i'm getting at is that you

760
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,840
don't even need to signal it you could

761
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,679
just say because i'm part of this thing

762
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,279
i've got it configured to auto tunnel

763
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,279
right and so i'll just accept packets

764
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,039
and encapsulate yeah but you have to

765
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,960
know what type of tunnel

766
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
is supported and what is the end point

767
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,320
address of the other guy right and

768
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,000
that's exactly right

769
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,720
right

770
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
so that's what i was getting at is that

771
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,600
that up front um rather than signaling

772
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,840
tunnels just saying what type of tunnel

773
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,360
and then everyone just does it anyway

774
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,880
it's just that this was a thought about

775
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,720
it well so see the tunnel saying you

776
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,440
know uh if you talk to four customers

777
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
what tunnel they prefer they got fi you

778
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,919
get five to six answers

779
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,679
right so that's

780
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,520
that that was exactly the discussion we

781
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,200
were having and we tried to steer them

782
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,760
towards you know gre and you know every

783
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,880
tunnel has it worked and silicon support

784
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,000
problems and frankly

785
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,720
the most advanced customers they they

786
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,559
end up preferring the no tunnel option

787
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,240
and that's why we worked on that stuff

788
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,000
most extensively so

789
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,080
we suggested the whole thing a while ago

790
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,159
and the most of these to get people

791
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,039
actually reject the tunnel uh

792
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,640
uh option

793
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,320
for you know a lot of reasons which are

794
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,399
often non-obvious right operational

795
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,480
silicon reasons and so on

796
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,399
so i have just a follow-up question on

797
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,320
the tunnels you know uh you in the draft

798
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,399
i think you might have added the ttz

799
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,519
comparison it did get me thinking

800
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,760
you know the ttc gives you a full mesh

801
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,919
of adjacencies and and you're cutting

802
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,080
down you know that's the main advantage

803
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,039
here is the

804
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,679
adjacency um the reflector keeps your

805
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,279
adjacency hub and smooth yeah yeah

806
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,600
did they get away i don't remember and

807
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,679
so i'm asking you about their draft but

808
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,240
do they require tunnels between their l1

809
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,960
l2 between their ttz edge

810
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,640
or how did they solve that forwarding

811
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,039
problem did they do the problem they

812
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,600
have underneath the full full mesh of

813
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,559
tunnels

814
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,960
which this block has as well right it's

815
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,279
just hidden that's that's the difference

816
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,039
right this draft basically hides the

817
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,399
full nash by

818
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,120
no showing that whatever a double star

819
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,519
and that's architecturally really you

820
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,279
know the only difference in the rest is

821
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,440
kind of you know mechanics and little

822
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,399
smart you know curriculus and so on

823
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,679
um

824
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,159
what is of course drastically different

825
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,880
is the no tunnel option right but this

826
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,440
is far more sophisticated to deploy i

827
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,600
mean this is a much sharper knife i'll

828
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,519
bite

829
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,320
no uh

830
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,559
um

831
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,679
how should i put it um

832
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,519
it's it's very

833
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,080
appealing right because you get rid of

834
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,919
all the time stuff and you get very good

835
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,600
you know properties in terms of

836
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,440
scalability but you have to know what

837
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,960
you're doing when you start to flood all

838
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,000
the l2 into l1 and l1 you know out in

839
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,600
terms of this

840
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,960
yes

841
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,840
yes

842
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,880
let me uh wemos he's not in the queue

843
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,960
but he's put in the chat ttz does not

844
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,679
use tunnels

845
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,399
yeah can i can i speak it for

846
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,000
400 seconds

847
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,480
yeah for ospf tdz

848
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,600
for the tdz ages fully connection

849
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,440
uh they they don't use

850
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,840
tunnels they use the shortest path

851
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,399
because uh

852
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,879
that's a

853
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,919
forwarding from one age to another age

854
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,000
to this age the justice is that because

855
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,080
that's because you that's because you so

856
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,919
you advertise all the outside

857
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,080
reachability into the ttz then

858
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,240
so you don't use tunnels but you do have

859
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,720
to advertise all in this case in the

860
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,240
context here it would be you'd be

861
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,120
advertising all the l2 into the l1

862
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,399
okay

863
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,480
yeah okay cool thanks i don't want to

864
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
take up any more time um we do have a

865
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,320
lot of slop we have like 20 minutes of

866
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,159
slop but you know

867
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,799
yeah yeah i mean i uh remember the ttc

868
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,320
differently but it's a while since i

869
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,000
read it you know when there were initial

870
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,679
discussion eight years ago when i was in

871
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,440
new mexico about you know why the whole

872
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,960
thing would loop and then the full mesh

873
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,839
came up and so on um yeah

874
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,679
but you know this this thing was

875
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,560
specifically built to scale up l2 right

876
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,639
so we couldn't yeah no not all the stuff

877
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,079
into l2

878
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,560
and then the l1 does underneath what l1

879
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,560
needs to do yes

880
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,079
all right so

881
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,000
i hope it was enlightening to a point i

882
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,639
think the drop is now very very detailed

883
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,599
um

884
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,119
if somebody were to attempt an

885
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,760
implementation

886
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,440
yeah yeah us this is ac speaking as a

887
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,000
working group chair i i we went through

888
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,480
some iterations and we handled all the

889
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,760
things that

890
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,560
myself and other people had uh said

891
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,239
needed to be clarified and i think it's

892
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,879
ready too i'd like some of the longtime

893
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,799
isis developers like

894
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,800
uh stefano

895
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,079
uh

896
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,240
strata less

897
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,160
uh

898
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,040
uh ahmed and uh some of the others i'd

899
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,800
like would be good if you would uh

900
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,599
review it as well oh bruno and bruno

901
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,119
yeah why don't we go hunt down hank

902
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,960
schmidt where is he

903
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,440
yeah yeah cisco becca being a lie hurt

904
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,680
yeah

905
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,760
no no uh nokia i think oh true true yeah

906
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,760
yeah

907
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,640
it sounds like we'll do we'll put a

908
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,960
working class call out then on the list

909
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,800
yes

910
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,280
cool excellent thanks

911
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,839
thanks

912
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,399
schrada's next right

913
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,200
yes

914
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,520
can you load your slides

915
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,680
okay good

916
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,200
we just aren't used to hitting the green

917
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,320
button i think

918
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,119
yeah

919
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,520
i did it

920
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,160
are you

921
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,000
you you're muted you have to click the

922
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,160
little mic icon

923
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,839
there

924
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,839
yeah can you hear me now

925
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,520
now we can yeah

926
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,720
okay

927
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,640
so i'll be presenting the application

928
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,040
specific link attributes uh

929
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,680
any application bit on behalf of my

930
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,399
co-authors

931
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,760
uh so we look at what problem we are

932
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,599
trying to solve with this

933
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,680
we will look into some of the details of

934
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,000
protocol extensions and how is the

935
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,680
backward compatibility handled

936
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,560
so um

937
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,640
the problem statement is that

938
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,640
network operators may want certain link

939
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,800
attributes to be used by all current and

940
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,880
future applications

941
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,160
so and we have many examples of

942
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,920
you know such attributes and how the

943
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,760
network evolved over many years

944
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,359
so uh and we um we have made asla

945
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,920
mandatory for some applications uh such

946
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,920
as uh flexalgo

947
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,320
so asla allows for an attribute

948
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,640
advertisement where link attributes

949
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
applicable to one applications or some

950
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,800
applications or all the applications

951
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,560
currently defined

952
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,079
but there's a limited provision to

953
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,079
advertise attributes that are applicable

954
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,839
to any application which are currently

955
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,440
defined or going to be defined in

956
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,319
future um

957
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,000
ah so the

958
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,240
reason why we call it limited

959
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,160
support is because

960
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,520
um rfc 8919 and 8920 they do not allow

961
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,680
application to use attributes from zero

962
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,640
length so there is a zero length sabm

963
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,599
ah

964
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,800
if you

965
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,880
advertise attributes under that zero

966
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,680
length sapm then any other

967
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,880
then

968
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,320
any application can use it unless

969
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,640
any the application has

970
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,200
any other attribute advertised with an

971
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,040
application bits it

972
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,839
so during a discussion in the mailing

973
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,440
list

974
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,760
there were opinions that more granular

975
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,320
control over attribute advertisement for

976
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,160
any application versus application

977
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,400
specific is useful like some micro

978
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,680
attributes

979
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,839
operators want to design it in an

980
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,440
application independent way so that

981
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,240
those attributes are always available

982
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,079
for any application that are currently

983
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,640
defined or in defined in future

984
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,799
and some specific applications may be

985
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,720
designed to be used in an application

986
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,599
specific way so this we are trying to

987
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,119
solve this problem where uh

988
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,079
you know this can be um

989
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,400
this control can be provided in asla

990
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,400
so the details of protocol extension so

991
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,680
the the

992
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,359
so any any bit is a standard bitmask

993
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,839
and it's a bit number four

994
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,000
uh so that implies that any application

995
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,599
so any attribute

996
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,240
advertised under this

997
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,160
can be used by

998
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,040
any application

999
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,200
so how to achieve backward compatibility

1000
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,720
so

1001
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,640
obviously a node that does not

1002
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,839
understand a bit it cannot process

1003
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:04,880
the

1004
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,599
attributes under

1005
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,800
under the

1006
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,440
advertisement which has an abe asla tlb

1007
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,359
which has an a bit set so it ignores

1008
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,200
that

1009
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,640
uh and processing of the other bits

1010
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,960
that remains as per uh eight nine one

1011
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,880
nine and eight nine two zero and this

1012
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,440
draft mandates that if same attribute is

1013
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,920
advertised under asla with a bit and

1014
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,359
there is an advertisement under asla

1015
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,599
with specific application bit set

1016
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,079
the one which which is application must

1017
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,240
use the one which which has the

1018
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,240
application bit set i know that takes

1019
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,599
the precedence

1020
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,880
so this is in order to

1021
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,440
avoid

1022
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,599
so let's say some nodes are upgraded

1023
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,920
they suddenly start advertising uh

1024
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,240
attributes with a bit set

1025
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,599
um and

1026
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,599
the older nodes they will pick up

1027
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,200
attributes under the application

1028
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,960
specific

1029
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,800
so that's the reason even the ones which

1030
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,119
understand the a bit will have to pick

1031
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,240
the

1032
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,640
attributes which are under a bits under

1033
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,680
the application bit set

1034
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,440
so until all nodes are upgraded to

1035
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,160
support a bit obviously the nodes won't

1036
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,280
be able to use the attributes which are

1037
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,040
advertised under 8-bit and hence

1038
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,599
the upgraded nodes also would have to

1039
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,440
advertise in in

1040
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,160
the attributes

1041
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,480
under a bit as well as under

1042
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,800
application specific bit set

1043
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,440
and the processing of the scbm with zero

1044
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
length continues to follow eight nine

1045
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,280
one nine and eight nine two zero no no

1046
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,440
nothing is this trap doesn't modify any

1047
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,000
of those procedures

1048
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,240
yeah request

1049
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,800
further review and comments on the draft

1050
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,520
and

1051
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,079
one and also request working group

1052
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,000
adoption and one more thing i want to

1053
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,160
clarify based on the

1054
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,119
uh

1055
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,920
on ac's comment uh in the beginning of

1056
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,920
the meeting today so this is quite

1057
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,480
independent from generic metrics so this

1058
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,839
is just trying to

1059
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,040
provide for for network operators who

1060
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,920
want to design certain attributes

1061
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,480
in an application independent manner and

1062
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,560
advertise them this is just giving that

1063
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,200
that of possibility uh

1064
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,800
so that those attributes can be

1065
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,720
advertised in an application independent

1066
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,680
way inside asla

1067
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,560
ah yeah that's the clarification

1068
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,599
any questions comments

1069
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,440
okay yeah i i realized that this didn't

1070
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,160
get us off the hook for the uh

1071
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,480
for the discussion of the continued

1072
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,520
discussion of the generic metric uh

1073
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,560
the one question i have

1074
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,839
if you have the a bit set

1075
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,440
and other bits

1076
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,760
you're you're going to use the whatever

1077
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,800
is advertised in that attribute

1078
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,280
in in either case

1079
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,240
so what's the advantage over the a bit

1080
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,560
over the zero length

1081
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,079
uh

1082
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,119
uh

1083
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,599
bit mask i mean you know the application

1084
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,520
i forget the acronyms for them what's

1085
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,920
the advantage that i couldn't i couldn't

1086
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,960
see that

1087
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,920
yeah so the difference is that um

1088
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,440
so let's say if you

1089
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,319
the

1090
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,480
you if you have designed one attribute

1091
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,720
let's say admin group in an application

1092
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,560
independent way

1093
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,119
so in in your network right so red color

1094
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,680
means one gig link and that means

1095
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,599
this red color is any application can

1096
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,319
use this red color this admin group so

1097
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,000
admin group is an attribute which is

1098
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,720
designed in the network to to be used by

1099
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,640
any application so now you can advertise

1100
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,800
it under a bit

1101
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,440
and there are some other applications uh

1102
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,839
some other attributes that you want to

1103
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,480
design it in an application specific way

1104
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,960
for example you want there is some let's

1105
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,440
say some bandwidth related attribute

1106
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,599
that that you want to design it and

1107
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,240
advertise it in uh in an application

1108
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,040
specific way so so different for srt

1109
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,040
different for flex and go and so on so

1110
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,079
you can

1111
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,520
you can do that i mean you can

1112
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,920
advertise that one under the bandwidth

1113
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,040
one under

1114
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,599
the application specific bit set

1115
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:34,839
and the

1116
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,760
uh the

1117
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,480
admin group under a bit set

1118
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,160
so whereas if you advertise um

1119
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,880
the admin group under sabm

1120
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,480
with all sabm with length zero

1121
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,319
and then for let's say for flex algo and

1122
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,800
srt you have advertised bandwidth now

1123
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,880
you cannot use the admin group

1124
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,119
for

1125
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,280
for srt and flex algo because they have

1126
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,240
the

1127
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,800
application bit set so basically it's

1128
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,920
giving you

1129
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,119
an

1130
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,119
opportunity to

1131
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,359
advertise attributes in an application

1132
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,240
independently on a per attribute basis

1133
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,079
so so to

1134
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,319
long story short because this is related

1135
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,760
to my question sorry to jump in front of

1136
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,960
you last but

1137
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,720
my question is the same except different

1138
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,040
which is i understand why you did this

1139
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,240
because

1140
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,240
the zero length can't be used the minute

1141
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,480
you use a non-zero length that's what

1142
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,520
you're saying

1143
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,359
yeah like so one attribute uses zero

1144
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,200
length everything's golden you do

1145
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,160
another attribute with a specific and

1146
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,680
then all of a sudden you have to stop

1147
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,760
listening to that zero length to me that

1148
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,520
seems like a fault in the original

1149
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,880
design

1150
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,280
like why don't we just fix that

1151
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,960
like why do why is it even that way and

1152
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,560
maybe less can answer that question

1153
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,240
yeah i will let less answer that

1154
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,200
question maybe i can follow

1155
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,399
is it my turn now chris

1156
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,160
yes

1157
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,200
yes

1158
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,160
okay

1159
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,119
so

1160
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,720
um

1161
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,560
we've had extensive discussion about the

1162
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,599
technical issues uh on the list

1163
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,760
um you know including the the points

1164
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,000
that uh you know ac and chris are are

1165
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,359
asking about

1166
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,839
um i don't want to go into that here

1167
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,240
um i don't think we have the time to go

1168
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,720
back and forth

1169
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,760
my

1170
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,079
the point i want to make is is kind of a

1171
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,319
much larger point

1172
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:35,040
the

1173
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,440
the function of the itf and the function

1174
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,880
of our working group is to produce

1175
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,960
a standard that supports

1176
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,720
interoperability

1177
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,760
we have done that with the assa rfcs

1178
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,960
8919 8920

1179
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,720
the authors of this document

1180
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,200
have decided that a certain portion

1181
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,319
of uh you know the way to support all

1182
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,160
applications or any application if you

1183
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,440
will

1184
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,599
is not to their liking

1185
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,160
and so they've proposed an alternate

1186
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,160
form of advertising this

1187
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,560
the two definitions the definition the

1188
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,480
zero length definition that exists in

1189
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,400
the asla rfcs

1190
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,839
and uh the a bit that's defined here

1191
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,839
are not compatible

1192
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:28,160
despite what what strata has presented

1193
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,880
in a real deployment

1194
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,440
all of the nodes that are operating in

1195
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,559
the network

1196
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,040
have to advertise things the same way in

1197
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,359
order to understand each other or they

1198
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,800
have to advertise things both ways

1199
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,440
in order to make sure that

1200
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,760
you know if a node's supporting one

1201
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,680
strategy versus another

1202
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,160
that everything is understood

1203
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,960
this now puts us in the position

1204
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,359
of instead of having a standard which

1205
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,160
everybody can

1206
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,000
use to support interoperability

1207
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,359
we now have

1208
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,680
multiple published solutions

1209
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,680
uh you know some of which are favored by

1210
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,359
one set of people and some of which are

1211
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,440
favored by another set of people

1212
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,559
this

1213
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,720
introduces a lot of interoperability

1214
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,680
issues

1215
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,400
it requires vendors to do multiple

1216
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,839
implementations

1217
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,680
of the same functionality not because

1218
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,240
one of the solutions is deficient but

1219
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,720
simply because some folks have decided

1220
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,640
we prefer to do it this way

1221
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,160
and and uh this to me does not serve the

1222
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,359
industry

1223
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,200
yeah okay this might be getting a little

1224
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,000
bit

1225
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,599
yeah yeah it's a this philosophy okay

1226
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,280
it's requesting working group adoption

1227
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,359
right i mean we haven't published two

1228
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,000
competing standards

1229
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,040
this right so your point is fine right

1230
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,040
but it but we're not like breaking the

1231
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,960
internet right they they've what you're

1232
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,400
saying is they're proposing a solution

1233
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,559
and it's not compatible that definitely

1234
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,559
should that should go into what the

1235
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,079
working group

1236
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,000
does right i mean no we don't want to

1237
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,079
publish two doc two things that compete

1238
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,000
with each other or cause problems so

1239
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,520
that's a great point but you know let's

1240
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,280
not take that too far

1241
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,040
because this is just a

1242
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,640
draft right

1243
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,280
so that's a reason not to go with it in

1244
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,640
your opinion

1245
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,760
correct right

1246
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,960
okay great

1247
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,079
um

1248
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,000
so we're out of time on this the

1249
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,599
question that i was asking i guess

1250
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,319
you're saying go read the list on me um

1251
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:31,359
is

1252
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,440
why the zero length can't be fixed it

1253
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,200
sounds a little broken but i'll we can

1254
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,480
do that on the list since we're out of

1255
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,599
time

1256
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,280
um

1257
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,520
and yeah sure and with this just just

1258
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,920
one comment with respect to leicester's

1259
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,200
uh

1260
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,720
observation

1261
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,680
um so i i think it's not right that you

1262
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,920
know this the two solutions are not

1263
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,280
interoperable

1264
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,280
how they can interrupt has been

1265
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,760
discussed just now in the previous slide

1266
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,359
i mean it's not clear we can discuss

1267
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,760
again uh but i do think that uh this

1268
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,640
very much interrupts with

1269
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,040
whatever has been deployed in 89 19 and

1270
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,359
89. you know it just gives another

1271
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,319
option

1272
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:13,040
let's do it on the list because i mean

1273
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,559
showing something doesn't interop is

1274
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,119
pretty easy right i mean and we can all

1275
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,280
technically look at that and look at the

1276
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,200
example i mean you usually can show an

1277
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,960
example right so if less is right you'll

1278
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,440
throw an example out and we'll go yep

1279
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,040
les is right and if les can't come up

1280
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,040
with an example then you're right

1281
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,520
that's easy enough right

1282
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,200
yeah yeah the the one thing so we can

1283
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,200
take it to the list yeah we'll take its

1284
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,280
list it stuck out in my mind it said

1285
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,400
when

1286
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,640
everybody has upgraded and there was no

1287
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,480
nothing in the protocol to do that it

1288
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,559
seemed like it was an operational

1289
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,720
uh interoperability and not a protocol

1290
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,000
interoperability but anyway

1291
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,839
okay

1292
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:56,480
uh who's up next all right

1293
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,400
and passive

1294
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,640
okay so

1295
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,280
we need to drop i think i can just

1296
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,200
knock this down

1297
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,280
eisen okay

1298
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,480
so you

1299
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,800
hit your little document icon you did

1300
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,520
and i hit your green and you get it

1301
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,520
okay

1302
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,240
so make sure you hit your mic

1303
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,399
little mic icon so we can hear you

1304
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,000
there you go

1305
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,720
oh you're sharing your screen no no no

1306
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,118
don't do that

1307
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,880
don't do that click the click the little

1308
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,200
document right next to the monitor

1309
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,000
between the hand and the monitor there's

1310
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,720
a little document icon i just

1311
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,839
click that

1312
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,839
we can't hear you either

1313
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:13,520
yeah and i can't hear you talking yet so

1314
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,960
that might also be another problem

1315
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,440
okay that doesn't look like the icon but

1316
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,680
okay

1317
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,839
yeah that's not the right thing

1318
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,680
click next to it do you see the little

1319
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,960
document

1320
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,800
okay nevermind the second one

1321
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,880
it's okay i guess you can share your

1322
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,559
screen but we can't hear you so

1323
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,559
um

1324
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,280
can you uh talk

1325
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,040
you have to click the mic icon

1326
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,800
yeah you have to click the mic you're

1327
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,400
muted

1328
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,359
okay say something

1329
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,599
hello

1330
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,599
yes now we can hear you

1331
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,240
oh so

1332
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,720
i try to share a screen but it did not

1333
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,319
work

1334
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,079
we don't we don't do the screen you

1335
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,520
click the document

1336
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,520
see right now i see the monitor up there

1337
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,200
you see oh not the screen but the

1338
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,640
document okay

1339
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,440
yeah just go ahead and present

1340
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,200
okay or don't

1341
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,879
yeah it's gonna say you're oh okay

1342
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,960
you have to stop doing the screen i'll

1343
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,680
do that for you hang on yeah and then

1344
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,960
that one works

1345
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,119
there we go

1346
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,839
okay

1347
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,880
okay

1348
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,720
oh okay

1349
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,680
hello

1350
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,399
it worked now

1351
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,920
yes

1352
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,400
yes like under 12 minutes we're starting

1353
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,000
running

1354
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,319
so let let me start the the instruction

1355
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:10,800
i i i've gotten two two documents the

1356
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,119
first thing is a political arrangement

1357
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,880
anonymous mechanism

1358
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,400
i think this has been discussed

1359
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,400
intensely on the main list

1360
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,839
uh so i think uh uh

1361
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:28,079
we're all familiar with the scenario so

1362
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,359
uh i just

1363
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:33,119
described the solution directly the

1364
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,520
pm solution there are

1365
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,440
the the main the main step is

1366
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,640
is open receiving the node link failure

1367
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,920
information

1368
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,760
which is perfectly either in the range

1369
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,559
of the androidized summary of this the

1370
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,319
abr or

1371
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,880
element or

1372
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,760
with a failure prefix associated but the

1373
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,640
set is originator information for now

1374
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,799
and we use the

1375
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:10,799
ipv4 and ipv6 software u is and ospf

1376
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:11,920
so

1377
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,880
such

1378
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,200
summary message will be flooded across

1379
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,520
across the boundary a normal old tfo and

1380
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,559
isa procedure

1381
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:25,440
so

1382
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,640
we

1383
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,680
for no disappear scenario so one node

1384
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,720
really within one area receives a such

1385
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,079
message from all of its abrs it will

1386
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,319
trigger the switch over of the control

1387
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,400
plane for the already service such as

1388
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,319
btp or gtr tunnel autonomous service

1389
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:45,520
that is

1390
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,599
on top of it

1391
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,040
for link

1392
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,119
failure or

1393
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:53,440
only some of the apr

1394
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,000
can reach the prefix that is we call the

1395
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,480
network of partitional scenario

1396
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,160
so

1397
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,760
then we are only some of the avr can't

1398
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,920
reach the failure prefix

1399
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,799
the abr that can reach the prefix

1400
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,760
uh will under advertise the specific

1401
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,680
load to this

1402
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:17,040
qm prefix so this procedure is the same

1403
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,000
as the river

1404
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,160
and

1405
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,520
avr

1406
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,480
will only send out the such message

1407
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,960
about all the internal routers for the

1408
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,520
search mechanism

1409
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,040
and avr can also control want to send

1410
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,920
out such message based on sl-like

1411
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,920
configuration to say

1412
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,200
it is

1413
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,160
one

1414
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,119
some link or some link failure but it is

1415
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,160
not

1416
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,240
um within the

1417
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,280
uh

1418
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,079
interesting prefix so the apr

1419
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:53,520
should not

1420
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,799
uh send out some message so it keeps

1421
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,960
people the

1422
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,960
the the

1423
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:06,000
original performance of the idp

1424
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,240
and

1425
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,959
to achieve

1426
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,400
the avr knows know the capability of the

1427
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,839
os internet internal cap internal

1428
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:20,000
capability to support the

1429
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,280
uh pa mode so we head back for the

1430
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,839
capability on augment from the previous

1431
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:28,000
versa

1432
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,640
so then no medium area should all

1433
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,280
support such mechanism

1434
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,599
to install the act correctly based on

1435
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:38,559
the such information we also under

1436
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,920
another consideration for ospf a2 h3 and

1437
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,559
iso

1438
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:47,119
and

1439
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:48,400
there is a

1440
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,760
similar propeller by unless and peter

1441
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,040
for the

1442
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,280
even the notification solution

1443
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,079
we have discussed uh this solution

1444
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,480
online or offline and

1445
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,520
uh here

1446
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,000
just our um

1447
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,440
conclusion for

1448
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,079
this even the notification solution

1449
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:10,480
proper proper one general even a

1450
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,520
notification container varying eyes

1451
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,760
to deliver the positive or negative

1452
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,720
pulse event based on the flooding scope

1453
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:23,200
lsp also 1750

1454
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,480
currently uh it is on focus only on the

1455
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,520
same use case as a pm chapter

1456
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,960
and based on the discussion we think

1457
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,960
for 4 pm

1458
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,720
and

1459
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,200
for the current use case both solution

1460
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,839
can achieve the same result

1461
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:42,559
and

1462
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,480
about 40 am the existing led pdf format

1463
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,839
and procedure can be

1464
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:51,040
utilized and

1465
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,160
the solution is the same same procedure

1466
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,640
for ospf and iss

1467
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,559
and we think it is

1468
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:00,319
easy to implement

1469
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:04,640
deploy and debug in the protagon network

1470
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,440
and

1471
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,040
there we also

1472
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,040
can

1473
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,960
consider some misbehavior for the

1474
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,000
unspotted node by the way we have simply

1475
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,680
the such behavior can be controlled

1476
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,140
you know kind of considering in

1477
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,079
[Music]

1478
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,680
in department

1479
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,400
and for even the notification solution

1480
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,280
we think it is almost the same

1481
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,440
procedure as qm

1482
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,400
the difference lies mainly how to encode

1483
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,640
such a such message

1484
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,760
and

1485
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,359
for we think for general solution

1486
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:44,240
such general some even notifications

1487
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,799
it should be compared with other

1488
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:49,280
existing solutions for the positional

1489
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,480
requirement because it is not able to

1490
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,960
solve only the principling reachable

1491
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,480
announcement

1492
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,400
and i may think

1493
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,040
because the currently there is only

1494
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,280
one use case for such a

1495
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,760
certain mechanism we think it is a

1496
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,480
mature to introduce regional parts

1497
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,000
mechanical within idp and currently

1498
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:12,960
and

1499
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,559
for spf uh there is another solution

1500
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,480
proposed by m

1501
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,040
about 10 years ago

1502
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,400
and

1503
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,000
we also need to consider how to

1504
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
implement such evil notification in ospf

1505
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,400
and uis

1506
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,559
so

1507
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,079
for example we think this is a topic

1508
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:39,680
that held

1509
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,599
enough interest on the list and

1510
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:46,000
we think it is

1511
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,359
it is the time to for adopting call for

1512
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:50,640
this software

1513
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,079
okay let's

1514
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,400
first discuss this after and after the

1515
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,680
question i will

1516
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,879
introduce the next one

1517
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,280
yeah so

1518
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,760
go ahead guys

1519
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:06,240
uh so i will

1520
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:06,960
okay

1521
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,559
no less than the q just let less good

1522
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,160
okay the comment i want to make i think

1523
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,000
the discussion on the list has

1524
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,839
highlighted the fact

1525
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,880
that there's an open question as to

1526
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,119
independent of whether we use the prefix

1527
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:22,480
unreachable draft or the event

1528
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,359
notification draft as to whether this

1529
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:28,079
problem should be solved by the igps

1530
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,640
or whether it should be solved by bgp or

1531
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,079
some other way

1532
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:34,160
and i think the logical way to proceed

1533
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,319
on this is to get consensus of the

1534
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:38,880
working group as to whether an igp

1535
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,119
solution is desired

1536
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:42,319
first

1537
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,640
then after we reach consensus on that

1538
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,480
then we can start talking about which

1539
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,079
approach

1540
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,160
is the better approach you know which

1541
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,640
one should be adopted

1542
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,920
yeah so uh chair hat on um they've been

1543
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,839
asking for adoption for a while um

1544
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,079
the event thing is new i agree with what

1545
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:03,920
you just said less in a perfect world

1546
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,480
that would be the case but then again

1547
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,559
asking for adoption is one way to answer

1548
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,079
that question

1549
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:11,839
it may be not the perfect way to answer

1550
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:13,119
that question

1551
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:15,039
but um

1552
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,559
it is one way

1553
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:20,880
and uh i mean i i agree without my chair

1554
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,200
hat on i'm not sure we need this

1555
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,000
right

1556
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,280
uh but

1557
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,599
it's not for me to say by fiat

1558
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:28,799
um

1559
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:31,119
we uh ac did put something out on the

1560
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,319
list to try to engage people again and i

1561
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:37,280
don't think a lot uh got said

1562
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,960
yeah i

1563
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,640
go ahead okay

1564
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,280
go ahead finish chris uh no that that

1565
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,000
was all he's gonna say um it is eijon

1566
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,920
has another presentation he only has got

1567
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,720
three minutes left i want to seriously

1568
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,160
share the document but cannot

1569
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,000
you you've got to share the same thing

1570
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:56,880
again

1571
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,720
yeah yeah just just what he's bringing

1572
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,799
that up i didn't i i didn't see much

1573
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:02,960
support other than the offers and i saw

1574
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,920
one non-offer supporting uh the other

1575
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,839
the event notification

1576
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:10,000
so

1577
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,680
you know i think it's fair uh you know

1578
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,599
everyone has a right to ask for an

1579
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:17,200
adoption and right you know i i don't

1580
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,640
know so if

1581
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,160
and everyone has a right to say we

1582
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,599
shouldn't adopt this and these are the

1583
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,960
reasons

1584
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,079
um

1585
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:25,760
we've sort of let it been letting it

1586
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,520
percolate to try to get people to

1587
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:31,039
express opinions and without seeing a

1588
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:33,359
lot of negative opinions it's it's hard

1589
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:37,200
not to just grant the adoption call

1590
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,839
tony do you have a quick thing to say

1591
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:42,240
yeah i think so um

1592
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,480
i think this is all trash can in the igp

1593
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,640
i mean nothing new has been done forever

1594
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,200
because hey that's not everybody can get

1595
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,160
everywhere uh one possible solution is

1596
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,000
to uh

1597
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,480
ban or encourage maybe everyone with

1598
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,480
this kind of suggestions to go towards

1599
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,559
the service instant stuff or whatever we

1600
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:02,720
call it which i think is a good idea

1601
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,960
just run apart on igp at much lower

1602
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,799
priority and don't trash the main thing

1603
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:09,039
that holds the whole thing together

1604
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:11,760
that sounds like a great comment um

1605
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,319
for the adoption call

1606
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:16,960
or or for have coming out before but

1607
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:17,839
yeah

1608
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:18,799
yeah

1609
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:21,039
and as a as a working good member i i

1610
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:23,760
agree with you

1611
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,079
okay we gotta move he's got a minute and

1612
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:28,079
a half we got a four minutes of slop

1613
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:31,119

we can't hear you

1621

lower right is clicked

01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:58,000
serving the 5g edge computing services

1670
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,480

1671
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,480

peter for helping us um offline to shape

1674
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:11,039

1675
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,079
shorter and to the point and many thanks

1676
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:15,760
to other people on the mailing list

1677
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,680
discussion to help shaping this

1678
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,359
draft

1679
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:22,720
okay

1680
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,119
so a little bit background

1681
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:26,480
um

1682
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,720
so this is for the edge computing

1683
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,319
environment where

1684
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:33,680
um the servers are very close to the

1685
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:37,119
proximity of the

1686
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:40,720
5g size like upf and the

1687
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,200
psa package session anchors

1688
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,000
and for the mission sensitive

1689
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,960
applications it is very common to have

1690
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,680
multiple servers um for the same

1691
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:54,480
application all close together

1692
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,480
there are many use cases being discussed

1693
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,280
in 3gpp for this kind of

1694
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,160
applications and this kind of deployment

1695
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,799
and so for the itp domain you may have a

1696
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:07,839
small set of um

1697
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,400
routers and then the e-waste router will

1698
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,079
have the

1699
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:13,119
server's

1700
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:15,599
edge server edge computing server

1701
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:18,158
directly attached to the routers so this

1702
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:20,719
is the basic background

1703
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:22,880
so

1704
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,560
very frequently

1705
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,600
and it has been used um the many

1706
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,319
benefits of using anycast

1707
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,719
basically is to leverage the network

1708
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:33,839
condition

1709
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:36,238
to distribute the packets

1710
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:37,600
so that

1711
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,479
if there's changes in the ue behavior

1712
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:42,719
like for example um

1713
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,799
lots of users

1714
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:48,560
move to one location for like concert or

1715
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,040
conference call or gathering

1716
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,479
and the

1717
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:55,600
servers nearby the cell tower may be

1718
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,319
overbooked uh over utilized

1719
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:02,238
and at this point that like the network

1720
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:05,839
routing distance to the others may be

1721
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:09,198
very very small difference so

1722
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:11,600
compare with the utilization of the

1723
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,960
server so that the network itself if any

1724
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,319
cases used can automatically migrate the

1725
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:21,759
traffic to the location where

1726
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:22,719
there are

1727
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:25,359
less utilized servers available compute

1728
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:26,560
available

1729
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,880
and also it is make it possible to

1730
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,600
eliminate the single point of failure

1731
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,198
like a dns resolver or the

1732
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:37,920
load balancer like typically today we

1733
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,120
have their net application layer

1734
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,238
load balancer which has many servers

1735
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:45,679
attached behind

1736
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:47,520
but to a network there's only one

1737
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,839
address where we see the network

1738
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:51,279
load balancer

1739
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:53,839
but if the condition network condition

1740
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:56,640
to the load balancer has some issues

1741
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,400
then impact the

1742
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,600
the performance so using any task can

1743
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,480
without can eliminate that issues

1744
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,520
also

1745
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,239
many clients may use

1746
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:09,440
stealth

1747
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,239
ip addresses they may only retrieve the

1748
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:14,480
ip address once a while so

1749
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,800
when they move from one cell tower to

1750
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,120
another cell tower they may still have

1751
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,480
the old ip address

1752
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:26,159
and this is um become more acute in a 5g

1753
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:28,400
environment because in 4g you don't have

1754
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:32,719
that much issue 4g maybe the entire city

1755
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:34,239
only has one

1756
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,560
packet gateway so everybody traffic

1757
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,719
doesn't matter where you move to um

1758
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:41,760
unless you drive very far away

1759
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,920
your traffic all entered into the same

1760
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,560
ingress router to the iq network

1761
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,520
or the same packet gateway but in 5g

1762
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,800
environment there will be many many

1763
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,600
those user plan functions and packet

1764
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,560
anchor

1765
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,920
points so that when user move the the

1766
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,920
traffic move and their

1767
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,080
associate

1768
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,560
the local network um

1769
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,800
local network routers they were going

1770
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,600
through the different ingress routers

1771
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,960
so

1772
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,120
so that's basically the benefit using

1773
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,400
any cast

1774
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,760
and

1775
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,520
and then this right this particular

1776
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,199
contribution of the draft is to

1777
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,920
bring up another layer of

1778
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,360
matrix in compute the past shortest path

1779
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,320
uh since those um

1780
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,559
those

1781
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:42,000
servers um

1782
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,480
they are attached to the the egress

1783
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,840
routers and uh um like for example the

1784
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,080
site can have different

1785
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,320
value or preference and they may have

1786
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,520
different capacity and so we want to

1787
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,640
bring this

1788
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,199
information into the

1789
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:00,400
igp's

1790
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,960
constraint past compute

1791
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,400
okay

1792
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,800
so the overview

1793
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,480
of the solutions pretty simple um so one

1794
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,960
thing is the the egress router need to

1795
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,080
advertise the site cost of the

1796
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:19,120
in the id prefix reachability tlb to

1797
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,760
indicate the the value the cost value to

1798
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,400
reach specific prefix

1799
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,239
and and

1800
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,080
bear in mind that

1801
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,600
not everybody not every service in this

1802
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,520
ldl required is preferred or specialized

1803
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,640
compass compute only a small set of

1804
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,840
prefix like for example uh if you use

1805
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,880
this um aws wavelength zoom right if you

1806
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:45,760
want

1807
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:50,320
a low latency service um as a as a

1808
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:53,040
client they have to register their uh

1809
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,800
service with the

1810
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:59,040
provider so the provider is aware of a

1811
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,719
small set of

1812
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:04,719
services or ip addresses in our contacts

1813
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,199
that require the special treatment

1814
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:08,800
so

1815
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,239
so this this is um and then um we're

1816
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:14,640
using using the flat algorithm there's a

1817
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,840
new flag set to indicate that for this

1818
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,480
specific prefix that you need to

1819
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,920
consider the site cost to balance the um

1820
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,520
the actual cost to the specific prefix

1821
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,400
so that's the basic overview of this

1822
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,360
um

1823
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,560
and then

1824
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,080
for the um flex algorithm definition of

1825
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:39,440
flags of tlv we introduce a new flag to

1826
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,520
indicate that um

1827
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,400
this

1828
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,040
side cost matrix has to be need to be

1829
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:49,760
included to deliver uh to derive the

1830
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,440
constrained path

1831
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:54,080
to the prefix so that's just a new flag

1832
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,760
need to be introduced

1833
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:56,560
um

1834
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,280
once this new flags to be introduced and

1835
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,640
then the as the egress node it can

1836
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:06,080
advertise the um the cost the aggregate

1837
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,920
costs um which include the uh like a low

1838
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,040
back a load index may the egress node

1839
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,000
may measure the the package to the node

1840
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,400
or from the node from the prefix to the

1841
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,679
prefix and also including the site

1842
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:24,800
preference and other

1843
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,679
other parameters they compute aggregate

1844
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:28,560
cost

1845
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,560
and this cost can be

1846
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,000
advertised

1847
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,040
so

1848
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:36,560
in ospf v2

1849
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:40,159
we can add a new subtlb to be added into

1850
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:42,800
the extended prefix tlb to indicate the

1851
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,239
cost

1852
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:48,080
in ospf 3 v3

1853
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,840
that

1854
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,840
a same new

1855
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,320
sub tlb can be

1856
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:58,000
appended to the extended um

1857
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,520
prefix um lsa which is describing 80s

1858
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,199
let's get let's get to people i think

1859
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,560
you're at the end let's get to the

1860
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:07,760
people in the queue um no okay

1861
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:08,679
yeah

1862
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:12,719
okay so here's your feedback

1863
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,120
yeah linda thank you for the

1864
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,760
presentation uh and describing the use

1865
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:20,640
case

1866
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,440
so from if i understood correctly what

1867
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,679
you're trying to do is to

1868
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:28,080
you have multiple application servers

1869
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,560
they are represented using any

1870
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,040
single anycast address and you really

1871
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,280
want to load balance the traffic

1872
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,800
onto these

1873
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,640
application servers

1874
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:42,560
so to me it looks like it's a problem of

1875
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,640
load balancing onto the servers and

1876
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,360
probably what i feel is metric probably

1877
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,960
is not the right way because the moment

1878
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,960
you change the metric based on load or

1879
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:55,440
preference or whatever your traffic gets

1880
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,440
skewed towards that metric and then you

1881
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,679
have an oscillation right and you have

1882
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:00,640
more

1883
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:01,520
uh

1884
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,199
ues connecting to this particular

1885
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,360
servers because this metric

1886
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,040
looks better

1887
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,199
so because you're describing this as a

1888
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:11,600
load balancing problem what i think

1889
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,320
you really want to do is to

1890
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,880
use the factors that you have described

1891
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:20,400
like the load the preference and the

1892
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:25,440
site cost etc to compute the balance uh

1893
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,199
and low and use it as a load balancing

1894
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:29,520
mechanism basically unequal load

1895
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:34,920
balancing on ecmp any cost prefix

1896
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,800
so linda wants to use the network

1897
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,640
function the routing function to do the

1898
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,000
load balancing how do you do that

1899
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,199
without using a metric

1900
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,239
yeah so that makes me think this pro i

1901
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:48,960
mean

1902
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,880
you can do it with the pizza

1903
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,440
you're right i mean the hysteresis here

1904
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,679
are very important right

1905
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,840
because

1906
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,760
if you add one client to the thing and

1907
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,280
then the metric changes and then you're

1908
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,040
bouncing back and forth between the two

1909
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,199
sites right for each client that gets

1910
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:07,040
added so you have to put some kind of

1911
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,360
hysteresis on this so that that doesn't

1912
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,840
happen but eventually that is what you

1913
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,199
want to happen right that's load

1914
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:15,360
balancing you know going back and forth

1915
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,120
between the two you just maybe don't

1916
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,280
want to happen on a per client you know

1917
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,760
per one use

1918
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,560
um exactly so to me it appears that it's

1919
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,719
a load balancing problem and you know

1920
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:28,960
changing metric doesn't really isn't

1921
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:32,080
really going to solve the problem so

1922
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,000
i think there are there are

1923
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,920
other ways of doing it

1924
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:36,960
uh

1925
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,280
and even igp right the load balancing is

1926
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,639
generally done on next top

1927
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,960
equal next stops though you can do load

1928
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,719
balancing you can do unequal load

1929
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:49,040
balancing as well but on an anycast

1930
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:52,880
prefix that is multiple idea i mean this

1931
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,800
she's come up with a novel idea right

1932
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,600
it's it's moving a load balancer using

1933
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,520
harnessing the route function for for

1934
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,600
load balancing so you it's hard to come

1935
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,719
up with counter examples if it's novel

1936
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:06,960
can i jump to my comments will be

1937
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,120
related to this discussion yeah we're

1938
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,040
actually out of time so everyone else go

1939
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,840
fast i guess

1940
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,080
thank you very much and we can continue

1941
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:20,080
on discussion on the mailing list

1942
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,640
i mean two quick comments linda the

1943
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,120
first one is it looks like as the draft

1944
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,600
evolved you forgot to remove sections

1945
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,679
eight and nine the one on the link

1946
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:32,560
metric and the one on the stub

1947
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:33,440
uh

1948
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,920
stub link that gives a nod to the stub

1949
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,760
link draft which is also

1950
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,120
i think you want to remove those two

1951
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,640
sections can you

1952
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,400
you look at that yes

1953
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,320
yes yes

1954
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,560
a few sections um because just last few

1955
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,440
days discussion with peter and

1956
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,440
i shrink the slides but i haven't got a

1957
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,960
chance to

1958
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,199
okay update the draft and the other one

1959
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,600
is if you're not using the raw metrics

1960
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,840
if you're just using a an aggregated

1961
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,400
metric you can do this today with i mean

1962
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,560
irrespective of all the problems with

1963
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,600
load balancing using routing that

1964
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,480
right and chris were discussing uh you

1965
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,480
could do it just with base ospf just

1966
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,400
make the mix the anycast address an

1967
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,800
external route and use the type 2 metric

1968
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:17,840
that's your

1969
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,760
for the external metric that's your type

1970
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,960
2 metric there and it all works anyway

1971
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,159
but if you're going to use the raw

1972
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,000
metrics and have constraints on those

1973
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,920
that would be more of a more of a

1974
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,760
discussion

1975
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,000
we got to move to jing it's where we're

1976
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,199
100

1977
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:36,239
we're 100 on a slop at this point so uh

1978
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:38,560
next presentation thank you

1979
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,480
linda and we'll take the rest of the

1980
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,520
list

1981
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,840
okay

1982
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:49,280
zing well you're ready here we go

1983
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,840
perfect

1984
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,560
i'm gonna bring it down to eight minutes

1985
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,239
if you could try to pull it in that way

1986
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:59,839
we can have time for discussion

1987
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,719
hello everyone

1988
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,280
i am

1989
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:10,560
from huawei my topic is igp extension

1990
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,600
for past mtu nasa

1991
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:19,170
[Applause]

1992
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,800
we know that i start leveraged source

1993
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,679
routine mechanism and the process and

1994
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:29,600
prs labels are as a value side in the

1995
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,440
package header

1996
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,639
however

1997
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:35,920
the current mechanism in isa do not have

1998
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,760
the specific path

1999
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,560
contractor signaling so that the past

2000
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:44,159
mto information cannot be abandoned

2001
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:48,239
in advance therefore it cannot be

2002
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:50,719
ensure that the packet size is less than

2003
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:52,400
the past mto

2004
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,280
this draft pro was the

2005
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,800
necessary size and ospf attention for

2006
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,920
advertising the link mto

2007
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,280
particularly we define new link mtu

2008
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:08,239
subtree for both the access and

2009
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,159
ospf protocols

2010
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:13,280
with the igp funding process in the

2011
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,719
distributed

2012
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:15,920
signaling

2013
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,719
of the pdp transmission to the

2014
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:21,600
controller the ingress node of the

2015
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,639
controller is able to compute the pass

2016
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:29,560
mtu for the sr policy

2017
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,360
for the sis attention we defined

2018
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,239
we defined a new sub tree called link

2019
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:43,840
mtu subtree to carry the mto of the

2020
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,920
interface associated

2021
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,360
the link

2022
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:51,120
the link mto is advertised as an

2023
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,600
optional subtitles of the

2024
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,560
six

2025
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,800
rider the ties

2026
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,239
the less of the types failed the less

2027
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:02,480
fair the last failed and the value

2028
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,920
failed are one better one byte and two

2029
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,920
bets respectively

2030
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,840
the type values need to be determined

2031
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:20,049
[Music]

2032
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:26,239
for the ospf attention we define

2033
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:28,080
new subtlety

2034
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:31,920
called link mto sub trav4 ospf v2 and

2035
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,679
ospf raceway to carry the mto of the

2036
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:38,080
interface or search associated with the

2037
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:41,040
linker for osps v2

2038
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,000
the link mto is advertised as an

2039
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,600
optional subtly of the ospf way to

2040
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,280
attain the link to awa in the ospf way

2041
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,360
to attain the link

2042
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,760
opaquer lsa

2043
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,040
for ospf raceway the link mto is

2044
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,920
advertised as an optional subtle way of

2045
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,199
the

2046
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:09,760
link to in the ospf wave 3 e-rotor rsa

2047
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:13,040
the last of the type field the the last

2048
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,440
failed and the value failed

2049
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,440
are all two batters

2050
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:22,000
the test values for ospf v2 and ospf v3

2051
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,400
can be different and need to be

2052
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,840
determined after sub

2053
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,120
submitting

2054
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:40,560
this draft we received some feedbacks

2055
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,639
thanks for these feedbacks

2056
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:45,120
according to this feedback first the

2057
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:48,400
title idp attention for

2058
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,360
link mto may be more

2059
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,840
appropriate

2060
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,960
second the ospf tr way need to be

2061
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,239
bounded to four batters and such a two

2062
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:03,679
better the failed is funded before the

2063
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:09,280
mto value failed as a follow informator

2064
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,440
okay that's all

2065
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:18,159
yeah

2066
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:20,719
for your listening any question

2067
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:22,960
uh i um it looks like there's a couple

2068
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,040
people in the line i would just uh throw

2069
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,560
out the comment that after reading it i

2070
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,920
think your tie break should just be

2071
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:29,679
lowest time to you and forget all that

2072
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:32,880
stuff about encoding ids and all that

2073
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,920
um go ahead jeff

2074
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,639
okay seno

2075
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,320
some questions we have three minutes

2076
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,400
still jeff jeff has you're sorry i was

2077
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,520
fighting with my microphone yeah okay

2078
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,159
uh so my criticism is not specifically

2079
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:54,000
targeting you know how do we carry this

2080
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,560
inside of the protocol mechanism uh my

2081
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,719
comment to you is that

2082
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,880
the general issue that we seem to run

2083
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,880
into in the real world is that we can't

2084
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,400
believe what the protocols are telling

2085
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,560
us in a lot of cases so i know that you

2086
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,199
want to carry this stuff in the idp to

2087
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:11,440
signal you know to some front end here's

2088
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,840
what my path should actually be

2089
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:14,960
whether you believe it or not it's

2090
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:17,600
actually far more tricky because

2091
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,600
having the the graph of the individual

2092
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,600
mtus for the links will give you roughly

2093
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,080
the same type of information

2094
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,159
my suggestion to you is you know please

2095
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:27,679
take a look at the contents of the very

2096
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:29,440
simple bfd draft

2097
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,360
that's exposed here it could be carried

2098
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,360
in things like sbfd

2099
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,880
the general problem that you're going to

2100
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,719
have is

2101
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:40,080
you're told the path mtu is x but some

2102
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,840
component link that may be part of that

2103
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,760
path part of a backup link part of a

2104
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,080
fast reroute scenario

2105
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,080
pick any number of scenarios

2106
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,920
the path m2 is not going to be you know

2107
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,600
what you actually are told that it is

2108
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,840
and it's important to not trust that

2109
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,800
that's my comment thank you

2110
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:09,760
yeah

2111
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:10,719
um

2112
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:11,840
so

2113
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,960
i share jeff's concerns um

2114
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,080
i have a

2115
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:19,600
limited enthusiasm for this draft but

2116
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,920
uh in rig my comment is in regards to

2117
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,719
isis if the working group decides to

2118
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:26,560
move forward with this draft

2119
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,120
there are already uh two code points

2120
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,600
that potentially can be used to

2121
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,040
advertise this

2122
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,719
uh one of them

2123
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:36,719
particularly the per link advertisement

2124
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:38,719
was defined by trill

2125
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:41,040
it would require a bit of adaptation to

2126
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,480
be used

2127
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,480
in this context but i think it's quite

2128
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,000
feasible so i'd like us not to allocate

2129
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,080
yet another code point if we decide to

2130
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,960
move forward with this for isis

2131
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:55,040
thanks

2132
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:58,639
thanks les uh easy

2133
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,320
yeah yeah we've got

2134
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,159
my comment speaking of working

2135
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:04,800
member is we've got a a long without

2136
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,360
this for decades it seems like just a

2137
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,679
protocol you know bringing this in

2138
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:10,960
because it's

2139
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,960
it can be done i don't know i looked at

2140
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,040
the use case of sr

2141
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:17,679
and what i would typically do

2142
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:20,000
is you definitely you don't

2143
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,040
you know if you want to generate mtu's

2144
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:25,760
uh i would just take the lowest one in

2145
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:26,880
the

2146
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,120
in the whole domain and use that as my

2147
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,040
sending them to you so i could make sure

2148
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:34,320
that any opposed labels

2149
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,600
i think that's what they're that's what

2150
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,960
they're kind of doing

2151
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,480
they're kind of doing okay but then you

2152
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:39,920
don't then you know then you need it

2153
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,639
then you just use a capability and do it

2154
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:44,719
do it on a

2155
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:47,440
do it on a node basis instead of a link

2156
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:48,719
basis that would be a different way to

2157
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:49,760
do it

2158
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,639
yeah

2159
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:52,239
the other okay well these are good these

2160
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:54,480
are good list comments um

2161
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:55,840
i'll throw i'll throw out there that you

2162
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,320
know we we're tunneling like crazy but

2163
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:01,520
in the last you know five years or so so

2164
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,960
we that that's getting worse it's

2165
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,040
getting worse and worse but yeah anyway

2166
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,480
these are good let's have the discussion

2167
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:09,040
on the list it's a new draft

2168
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,880
thanks zing um

2169
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,800
all right we might be back on time

2170
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,840
almost um

2171
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:21,920
maybe not

2172
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,520
it's my turn

2173
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:25,280
hello please

2174
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,360

can you see my

2179
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,520
slides yes

2180
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,960
i'm gonna cut you down to eight minutes

2181
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,880
as well just to make sure we get in

2182
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,800
questions

2183
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,320
okay

2184
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,719
uh hello everyone uh it's xiaomi

2185
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:54,080
speaking

2186
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:57,520
this presentation is on signaling flow

2187
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:00,480
id label capabilities and the flow id

2188
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:03,600
readable label depth using igp and the

2189
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,840
bgpls

2190
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,760
this is the first time i present this

2191
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,760
individual draft

2192
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:14,280
the latest version is zero one

2193
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,239
okay

2194
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:28,400
this is a short shaft the intention of

2195
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,440
this draft is to define a mechanism to

2196
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:34,239
signal the falc and the

2197
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:36,080
frld

2198
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,960
using igp and btp os

2199
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:43,280
here flc stands for flow id label

2200
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,760
capability which is the ability to

2201
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,560
process flow id labels

2202
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,960
here frld stands for

2203
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:54,719
flow id readable labeled depths

2204
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:56,960
which is the capability of reading the

2205
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:00,320
maximum amperas label stack depth

2206
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,600
and

2207
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,760
performing flow id label based

2208
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,639
performance measurement

2209
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:07,440
we

2210
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,880
already have

2211
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,400
obviously a

2212
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:14,400
1988 that defines the mechanism to

2213
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,639
signal entropy label capability and

2214
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:17,760
entropy

2215
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,360
uh readable label depth using iss and

2216
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,360
vgpos

2217
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,480
and we also already have obviously a

2218
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:27,920
at

2219
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,320
9080

2220
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:32,960
89 that defines mechanism to signal

2221
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:35,920
entropy level capability and entropy

2222
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:37,840
readable label depths

2223
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:41,679
using ospf and bgpls

2224
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:44,000
this chapter is written

2225
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,840
modeling after

2226
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:49,239
the two offices

2227
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:57,840
this chapter results from an nps working

2228
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,400
group document that's called the

2229
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:05,120
draft ietf nps inband pm encapsulation

2230
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:07,840
in that document flow id label and its

2231
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:10,960
usage are defined

2232
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:14,560
this figure gives an example format of

2233
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,639
nps data package

2234
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:19,679
that includes flow id label

2235
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:22,960
in this example variety label is present

2236
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,000
twice

2237
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
within the label stack

2238
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,560
and each flow id label follows a

2239
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,080
composite

2240
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,719
special purpose label

2241
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:34,880
cspl

2242
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:38,000
each cspl is composed of two

2243
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,719
labels they are extension table label

2244
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:41,760
and

2245
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:45,360
flow id label indicator

2246
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,280
considering the size of the whole label

2247
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:48,719
stack

2248
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:51,760
in later revision of this

2249
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:52,960
nps

2250
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,080
document

2251
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:57,440
the cspm may be changed to a

2252
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:58,960
bspl

2253
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:01,920
base special purpose label

2254
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:05,840
or bspl plus bitmap

2255
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,120
anyway

2256
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:09,679
that potential change won't affect the

2257
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:13,840
availability of this dropped

2258
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:19,840
this slide demonstrates how to advertise

2259
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,600
falc by

2260
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:22,800
iss

2261
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:25,760
a one bit falc flag

2262
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:28,159
is borrowed from the prefix attribute

2263
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:29,360
flags

2264
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,760
that's defining rfc

2265
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:34,480
7794

2266
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:37,360
the borrowed flc flag is bit

2267
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:38,880
number four

2268
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:42,639
which is next to the elc flag

2269
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:48,120
uh defined in section three of c uh 1988

2270
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:50,320
are you going to comment now chris on

2271
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:53,120
that on this

2272
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,600
i was just getting in the cube

2273
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,920
okay

2274
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:00,480
um because you only have three minutes

2275
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:01,520
left i don't think you have to

2276
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,320
necessarily go through every

2277
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,800
um encapsulation here

2278
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:11,440
okay maybe just stick to the main points

2279
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,480
okay i see

2280
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:15,520
i can

2281
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,440
skip all the

2282
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,960
encapsulation

2283
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,239
i mean just talk about what you're

2284
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:22,880
advertising um you know i think it's

2285
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,159
important to point out that you're

2286
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:26,480
advertising it per prefix because that's

2287
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:29,120
going to come up

2288
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:30,639
yeah

2289
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:32,719
so

2290
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:34,800
this job to just

2291
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,400
model after

2292
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,000
rc uh

2293
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,440
1988 and 1989

2294
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,440
to advertise the

2295
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,920
flow id label capability

2296
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,520
and

2297
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,440
variety

2298
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,560
rather readable

2299
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,560
level level depth

2300
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,360
using rgb and pgpos

2301
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:58,960
so that's the intention

2302
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,679
that's the point

2303
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:05,040
yeah um

2304
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,280
okay so

2305
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:10,480
is that your last slide i thought

2306
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,800
i could go to my last slide

2307
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:16,400
yeah wait a minute yeah

2308
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:19,679
um so this is this is pretty new um my

2309
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:23,600
al my comments are quick uh you you

2310
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,760
i don't know why you did prefix you say

2311
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,679
it's useful but whatever we can talk

2312
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:29,600
about that on the list but you you also

2313
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,440
say that every interface has to support

2314
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,639
it so

2315
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:34,719
it's almost like when you propose to

2316
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:36,560
like somebody

2317
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:37,920
i'm gonna sell you a car for a billion

2318
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,199
dollars and then they say that's

2319
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:41,360
ridiculous i'll give you 500. i wonder

2320
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:42,719
if you're trying to like

2321
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:44,320
get it in there

2322
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:47,280
by doing that anyway i my my main

2323
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,440
comment is if this doesn't have to do

2324
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:50,800
with routing

2325
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:53,679
um the stroke is not clear to me sorry

2326
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:54,800
chris

2327
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,840
is not clear to me

2328
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,600
okay yeah never mind the first comment

2329
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,360
the second comment is if it doesn't have

2330
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:02,800
to do with routing it shouldn't be in

2331
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:06,320
the igp so unless the flc

2332
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:09,280
is affecting forwarding

2333
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,280
it's it's a management thing and it

2334
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,040
should be somewhere else is my my

2335
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:16,159
opinion as a working group contributor

2336
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:18,239
but you know just like ifit came into

2337
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:20,400
the working group and they wanted to do

2338
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,679
things that didn't have to do with

2339
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:22,719
forwarding

2340
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:24,480
they wanted to signal capabilities that

2341
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,239
didn't have to do with forwarding i

2342
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:28,719
think that violates what an ig igp

2343
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:31,040
should be advertising right

2344
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,040
that's my opinion working group chair uh

2345
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:35,040
not as a working choice i understand

2346
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,040
yeah i understand your point

2347
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,760
okay uh falc is used for

2348
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,840
performance performance

2349
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,520
it's not uh

2350
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:46,960
for direct forwarding all right right

2351
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,400
yeah that's what i read but i want to

2352
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,719
let other people talk uh ac or

2353
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:52,159
ac

2354
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:54,320
yeah mine's real quick i'm gonna try and

2355
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:57,280
state your first comment more simply

2356
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:00,320
rfc 9088 and

2357
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,159
908.9

2358
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:06,480
advertise uh this mpls capab these mpos

2359
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:10,159
capabilities on a link and node level

2360
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:12,880
yet you put it at the prefix level

2361
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,080
i don't know why you put it at the

2362
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,840
prefix level it seems like this should

2363
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:16,719
be

2364
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:19,760
have a similar form and structure to

2365
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:23,119
those two rfcs as opposed to

2366
01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:26,639
advertising things on a prefix

2367
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,920
and we can talk about the list

2368
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,159
yes i i can check it check that

2369
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:34,080
thank you thank you

2370
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,400
okay

2371
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,600
less so first yeah so

2372
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:42,560
first off i agree with chris's comment

2373
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:44,880
uh about this not necessarily being

2374
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,800
appropriate for the igp

2375
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,840
um i think the mystery about why

2376
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:52,080
uh you've chosen

2377
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:55,040
prefix reachability is you've been

2378
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:59,440
misled by the entropy drafts because we

2379
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,440
had a special case there where we wanted

2380
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:04,320
to advertise entropy capability out of

2381
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:07,280
the area and so we needed to use a

2382
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,360
prefix reachability advertisement to do

2383
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,920
it but it's really a node property and

2384
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:13,600
what you're talking about here is also a

2385
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,600
known property so if we were to

2386
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,679
advertise it it should go into router

2387
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:19,360
capabilities

2388
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:22,320
but again i i i agree with chris's

2389
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:24,239
comment that this may not be appropriate

2390
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:25,679
for the igp

2391
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:27,920
thanks okay thank you thank you very

2392
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,520
much

2393
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:31,760
all right thanks y'all uh

2394
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:34,159
we gotta move on so up next is uh the

2395
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:37,599
anacost property run

2396
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:43,719
wow ready to go bang

2397
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:02,119
wonder why this one's taking longer

2398
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:17,159
very very quiet

2399
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:20,159
yeah probably too quiet

2400
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:22,239
can you

2401
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:25,199
get closer to the mic

2402
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:28,480
turn up here yes okay yeah

2403
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,400
yeah much better

2404
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:33,520
okay hi everybody i'm from dt today i

2405
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:36,639
would like to talk about uh updates to

2406
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:37,840
unicast

2407
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,119
property advertisement for spf on behalf

2408
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:42,800
of co-author

2409
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:43,920
next oh sorry

2410
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:47,020
[Music]

2411
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,199
sorry i can't

2412
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:52,960
i can't control

2413
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,520
my slide

2414
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:58,800
arrow key on your keyboard oh oh

2415
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,800
oh yeah yeah okay

2416
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:05,040
i found the bot okay um yes this is the

2417
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:09,040
moto business um both both smps prefix

2418
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:12,960
seed and ipv4 ip and ipv6 prefix may be

2419
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:14,080
configured

2420
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:17,679
as any cost and as such the same value

2421
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:20,719
can be otherwise advertised by multiple

2422
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:21,760
daughters

2423
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:24,239
so it is very useful for other daughters

2424
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:26,880
to know that advertisement is for

2425
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,440
unicast identifiers

2426
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,320
fc uh

2427
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:34,800
7684 defines ospf v2

2428
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,320
uh opic

2429
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:39,440
ios a based on tr way that can be used

2430
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:42,080
to associate additional attributes with

2431
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:44,400
prefix or links

2432
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,119
eight bit field of the ospf with two

2433
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:50,320
extended prefix try as used to

2434
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,080
advertise

2435
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,560
additional attributes associated with

2436
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:57,760
the prefix but the definition of any

2437
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:01,119
class flight to identifier to prefix as

2438
01:40:01,119 --> 01:40:05,040
any cost has not yet been defined

2439
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:08,719
and however three bits have been defined

2440
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:09,760
um

2441
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:14,400
for fc 8362 extends the ios a format by

2442
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:17,920
encoding the existing ospf v3 i always

2443
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,800
say information uh in tla

2444
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:25,280
and for allah and allowing advertisement

2445
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,119
of additional information with

2446
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:28,800
additional tr way

2447
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,719
um its prefix is advertised along with

2448
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:36,320
an eight eight bit field of capability

2449
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:39,199
by using the prefix options but the

2450
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:41,600
definition of any cost of like to

2451
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,360
identify the prefix as any cost has not

2452
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,679
yet been defined

2453
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:50,320
and however only the final bit in the

2454
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:54,080
prefix options is not used

2455
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:56,880
so this document updates

2456
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:59,080
updates fc

2457
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:03,400
7684 and fc8362

2458
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:07,920
and we introduce a wire a wire a viable

2459
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:10,800
lens prefix attribute tr way for both

2460
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:13,840
ospf v2 and v3

2461
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:16,239
that can be reused in multiple of

2462
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:20,639
different rsa as as sub-tree and we also

2463
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:23,440
introduce a new flag a

2464
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:26,639
unicast flag in the prefix attribute sub

2465
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:29,040
tree to advertise

2466
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,119
uh the unicast

2467
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:32,719
property

2468
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:33,440
and

2469
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,920
this flat is for

2470
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:37,440
the

2471
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:40,639
wearable lens prefix attribute subtle

2472
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:41,840
way

2473
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:44,800
so in so in the case of ospf we need to

2474
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,199
the prefix attribute sub tov is a

2475
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:51,280
subtlety of the ospf v2 extended prefix

2476
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:53,760
tray as defined in rfc

2477
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,600
7684

2478
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:57,440
and in the case of

2479
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:00,000
ospf which three the prefix attribute

2480
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,600
subtree is a subtlety of the intra air

2481
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:07,760
prefix tray inter error prefix cova and

2482
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:11,040
external prefix tailway for the next

2483
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:13,760
slide is is fold

2484
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:16,080

2486
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:18,880
um

2487
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:21,920
for osp for the ospf way to uh the

2488
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,639
following uh the following flag please

2489
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:26,719
say that the first figure

2490
01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:28,400
has been defined

2491
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:31,679
and the first eight bit as reserved for

2492
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:35,199
the previously uh defined uspf v2

2493
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:38,239

2494
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:42,159

2495
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:44,239
for the a under un

2496

nine zero eight

2500
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:58,320
nine and in this document we defined a

2501
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,639
new flag ac flag

2502
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:03,199
as the new flight is used to advertise

2503
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:05,119
unicast property

2504
01:43:05,119 --> 01:43:05,920
uh

2505
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:09,119
in the case of ospi v3

2506
01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:13,440
please see the figure 2 and

2507
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:16,320
also the first 8-bit as result for the

2508
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:20,080
pro previously defined uspf v3 prefix

2509
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:23,040
options and the ac

2510
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:26,000
like is used to advertise undercast

2511
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,280
properties

2512
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:28,639
um

2513
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:30,400
so uh

2514
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:33,040
so we have defined uh

2515
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:36,560
the following processes use processing

2516
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:39,520
rules for easy flights the first is when

2517
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:42,400
the prefix is configured as uncast the

2518
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:45,280
ac flag should be cited

2519
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:47,760
otherwise this flag must be clear and

2520
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:50,480
the second is if both in flight and ac

2521
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:52,719
flight assigned the receiving daughters

2522
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:55,600
i must ignore the end flag and the

2523
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:58,159
second the third is ac flag must be

2524
01:43:58,159 --> 01:44:00,800
preserved when the prefix is

2525
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,960
properly propagated

2526
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:06,080
between areas and the last is the same

2527
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:08,560
prefix can be advertised by multiple

2528
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:12,239
daughters and that if any uh at least

2529
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:14,960
one of them sets the easy flag in its

2530
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:17,679
advertisement the prefix should be

2531
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:20,400
considered as any cost

2532
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,960
in the last last slide

2533
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:25,520
the last slide is for

2534
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:28,000
the procession rules

2535
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,080
about the prefix attribute sub tray uh

2536
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:35,040
the first is if there is a device uh in

2537
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,880
this network that don't support

2538
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:39,760
extensive of the prefix triple sub troa

2539
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:42,480
then the device that supports the prefix

2540
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:45,040
triple sub toa should advertise the

2541
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:47,760
field of the capability of the prefix by

2542
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:51,119
using prefix obstacles or previous flags

2543
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:53,520
and the prefix attribute sub tree

2544
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:55,760
otherwise only use the prefix attribute

2545
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,920
subtle way to advertise the field of

2546
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:01,040
capital capability of the prefix

2547
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:04,159
and the the second is pre prefixes and

2548
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:05,920
our test along with the field of

2549
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,520
capability by using the prefix or

2550
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:09,760
tributary array then the field of

2551
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:11,760
capability of the uh prefix in the

2552
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,920
prefix or triple sub two we

2553
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:17,199
sell preview and as well as the prefix

2554
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:19,679
sweeping sub troa is used to advertise

2555
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:22,000
the field of capability and the device

2556
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,159
supports the prefix attributes of troa

2557
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:25,840
then the field of capability in the

2558
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,400
prefix or treatment supply

2559
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:31,600
should be prevailed and the last if

2560
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:35,760
if is if prefixes is advertised along

2561
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:37,760
with the field of capability by using

2562
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,400
only the prefix substance or prefix

2563
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:41,360
flags

2564
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:42,960
then the field of capability in the

2565
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:46,560
prefix offices of prefix apply flags

2566
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:49,840
sharper will approve yes this is our

2567
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:52,239
priorities that's all thank you and

2568
01:45:52,239 --> 01:45:55,440
request request review and feedback from

2569
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:59,080
a working group

2570
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,920
i guess i'm at the top of the queue ac

2571
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:08,000
linda i'm speaking as member

2572
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,280
uh

2573
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,119
the first question is what is the use

2574
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:12,880
case for any castle i thought the whole

2575
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:14,080
idea was

2576
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:14,960
the

2577
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:18,159
is is that it was um

2578
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:20,000
that it was transparent

2579
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,600
the routers didn't know that it was in

2580
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,600
it the prefix of any cast

2581
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,520
and the second comment i have you say

2582
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:27,199
that you would not have to use the

2583
01:46:27,199 --> 01:46:29,199
former if you use this variable length

2584
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:30,639
advertisement you wouldn't have to use

2585
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:33,600
the former that's not the case because

2586
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,679
you still have to you still should set

2587
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:37,760
it for the existing flags for backward

2588
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:41,440
compatibility because uh

2589
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:43,440
the uh

2590
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:45,440
it's part of the prefix

2591
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:48,400
in both cases and both for both uh

2592
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:51,199
7684

2593
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:52,960
and

2594
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:57,520
the ospf b31 8362 or whatever it is the

2595
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:00,000
the the the prefix options in the case

2596
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,800
of ospf b3 and the and the flags field

2597
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,480
in the case of ospf

2598
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:08,159
uh v2 extended prefix is part of the

2599
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:09,840
same field that has the address so you

2600
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,679
really have to see so you can't you

2601
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:13,360
can't not use it

2602
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,119
yeah so

2603
01:47:15,119 --> 01:47:17,280
my comment is actually the same i think

2604
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:19,119
this maybe we need to go over this on

2605
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:20,639
the list but

2606
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:23,840
when i i when i read the um

2607
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,239
you know the sort of transition that

2608
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:28,560
that last slide talked about uh to me it

2609
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,080
sounded wrong

2610
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:31,920
at least when i read the document it was

2611
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:34,239
like it preferring like the new

2612
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:37,040
advertisement over the old one

2613
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:39,280
is is almost always wrong right because

2614
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:40,400
the the

2615
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,239
non-implementers or people who don't

2616
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:43,679
understand it are picking something

2617
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:45,760
different but i could have misread it

2618
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,040
either case i think that needs some

2619
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:49,199
review on the list i think i think and

2620
01:47:49,199 --> 01:47:51,119
and and it actually said you could admit

2621
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:53,520
it you can't admit it because the flag

2622
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:54,639
is there you might as well set it

2623
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:55,920
correctly

2624
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:59,119
yeah and and have that in the draft

2625
01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:01,440
yeah unless yeah okay so anyway but more

2626
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:04,159
on the list on that i think

2627
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:06,239
okay okay thank you

2628
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:07,520
thank you

2629
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:08,400
oh and

2630
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:10,320
and more on exactly what the use case is

2631
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,320
for having other routers know this is an

2632
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:15,280
anycast address

2633
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:19,040
okay answer that

2634
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:26,800
all right you're up and you're ready

2635
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,480
here's the slides

2636
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:32,440
i shouldn't be in the queue

2637
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:41,840
all right

2638
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:45,080
you're up

2639
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:53,679
hello

2640
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:56,000
yes we can hear you

2641
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,840
yeah okay

2642
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,600
okay

2643
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:02,400
thanks for giving me the opportunity

2644
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,719
my topic is easy

2645
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:10,840
easy extensions for link bit error ratio

2646
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,639
as we know in certain networks

2647
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:19,840
the network performance criteria are

2648
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:22,800
becoming as critical as other

2649
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,560
metrics to deadplane selection

2650
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:29,920
and this draft describes the extensions

2651
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:30,639
to

2652
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:33,199
easy's traffic and nearing metric

2653
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:35,119
extensions

2654
01:49:35,119 --> 01:49:38,800
this job provides the necessary easy

2655
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:42,080
extensions about the link beta error

2656
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:44,960
ratio that may need to be need to be

2657
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:49,199
used to describe network performance

2658
01:49:49,199 --> 01:49:52,800
as other is these t metric extensions

2659
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:56,639
for example the directional loss and the

2660
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:59,520
u-directional link delay

2661
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:02,159
the u-directional link beta ratio is

2662
01:50:02,159 --> 01:50:04,639
also meant to be used as part of the

2663
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:07,199
operation of the routine protocol

2664
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:09,679
to enhance cspf

2665
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:13,119
or for other uses such as

2666
01:50:13,119 --> 01:50:15,440
supplementing the data

2667
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:18,880
used by the controller to compute the

2668
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:22,360
police path

2669
01:50:24,239 --> 01:50:27,520
as shown in in this diagram

2670
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,679
the number first

2671
01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:32,560
path is the normal igp path

2672
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:35,280
which has the shortest metric

2673
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:38,400
and we may notify the link bit error

2674
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:41,679
ratio of every link by the router

2675
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:44,159
to the controller

2676
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:46,080
using bprs

2677
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:49,119
and the controller will calculate a

2678
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:52,320
policy path which has the lower link

2679
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:55,840
beta ratio as shown by

2680
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:57,360
number two parts

2681
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:59,040
so that

2682
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:01,360
different service may use different

2683
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:03,679
parts

2684
01:51:05,199 --> 01:51:08,000
on this slide

2685
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,960
as should on this slide we define the

2686
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:12,480
udirectional

2687
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:16,159
link capital ratio sub tle to carry the

2688
01:51:16,159 --> 01:51:19,119
link better edge of the interface

2689
01:51:19,119 --> 01:51:22,639
associated with the link

2690
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:25,520
the link bit error ratio must be the

2691
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:29,199
packet bit error from the local level to

2692
01:51:29,199 --> 01:51:32,400
the remote level

2693
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:35,520
and this sub-tree

2694
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:38,880
is advertised as an optional sub-theory

2695
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:42,960
of neighbor tlv in rsp

2696
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:46,480
the format is shown here it is similar

2697
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:49,840
to u-directional link losslab theory

2698
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:52,400
the type is to be defined

2699
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:56,639
the length is a constant value four

2700
01:51:56,639 --> 01:52:00,159
and we define one byte flags and only

2701
01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:01,199
use

2702
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:03,760
one bit here we call

2703
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:07,040
a normal speed and a bit

2704
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:10,480
the 8-bit is set when the measured value

2705
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:13,040
exceeds this configured

2706
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:17,199
max maximum threshold and will clear

2707
01:52:17,199 --> 01:52:20,239
when the value falls below is configured

2708
01:52:20,239 --> 01:52:23,440
reuse threshold

2709
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:30,880
and we use three bytes to carry link

2710
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:33,119
detail ratio

2711
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:37,440
so we have a basic unit as shown here

2712
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:39,199
and

2713
01:52:39,199 --> 01:52:41,760
so that the maximum value we can

2714
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:45,679
advertise is almost 50 percent

2715
01:52:45,679 --> 01:52:49,199
here we have to assu assume we assume

2716
01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:51,199
that

2717
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:53,360
recession is more important on high

2718
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:54,960
speed links

2719
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,840
than the ability to advertise a greater

2720
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:59,679
value than this

2721
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:00,639
and

2722
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:01,840
the

2723
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:05,920
thickness the high speed links with over

2724
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:11,320
50 percent bit error are unusable

2725
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:14,800
yeah

2726
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:18,000
thank you thank you everyone

2727
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:21,440
and i hope

2728
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:24,320
to get comments for from my list

2729
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:27,559
thank you

2730
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,880
any questions

2731
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,840
yeah

2732
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:33,440
i have a question

2733
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,040
what bit error rate

2734
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:39,599
is this is this um prefect or postfaq

2735
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:41,840
is it is it before correction or after

2736
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:44,400
correction

2737
01:53:46,239 --> 01:53:48,480
uh

2738
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:54,080
i think it is before correction

2739
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:55,040
right

2740
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:58,320
so this is hard i i mean i know what

2741
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:00,560
you're going for here is basically link

2742
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:02,400
quality a different measurement link

2743
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:03,679
quality

2744
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:05,040
um

2745
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:07,440
my experience uh

2746
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:10,639
the operator i've worked for was

2747
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:13,040
uh deutsche telekom right so it was way

2748
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:14,400
up high

2749
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,000
in the pecking order

2750
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,119
and

2751
01:54:17,119 --> 01:54:19,920
we worked on a new new network and for

2752
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:20,639
us

2753
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:23,280
any post fec bit error rate meant you

2754
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:25,119
took the thing out of service

2755
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:26,960
it was no percentage

2756
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:29,760
any prefect bit error rate unless it was

2757
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:31,599
immediately spiking

2758
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:34,400
just meant the thing was working right

2759
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,320
i mean if if you have a if you have a

2760
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:38,800
zero bit error rate post fact

2761
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:40,719
you have no packet loss due to bit

2762
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:42,639
errors

2763
01:54:42,639 --> 01:54:44,239
right and if you have

2764
01:54:44,239 --> 01:54:46,960
if you have if you do have a post effect

2765
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:48,400
bit error rate that at least the

2766
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:50,800
operator i work for you just stop using

2767
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,719
that link all together

2768
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:54,480
now there on all the routers there's

2769
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,400
there's you know alarms and different

2770
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:58,639
things that can watch this stuff

2771
01:54:58,639 --> 01:55:01,360
i'm just not sure uh how useful this is

2772
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:03,920
i'm interested in hearing from other

2773
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:06,000
people and other

2774
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,080
specifically you know either other

2775
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:10,400
operators at the you know sort of

2776
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,800
all free but also you know maybe does

2777
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:15,360
this have some kind of application in

2778
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:19,679
lossier networks i i don't know but um

2779
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:21,599
i i'm worried that

2780
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:24,400
this is too too fine of a grain to be

2781
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:27,759
looking at on the routing level

2782
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,920
yeah i'll just i'll just come in there

2783
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:34,080
speaking as working group member i see

2784
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:36,000
the encoding looks fine i mean it's

2785
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,639
similar to the other uh

2786
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:42,320
extended uh te metrics that we

2787
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:45,199
spent a lot of time on years ago but i'm

2788
01:55:45,199 --> 01:55:48,000
wondering what bit error rate

2789
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,679
offers you over and above packet loss

2790
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:53,360
they seem like they're

2791
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:54,880
you know

2792
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:58,480
basically uh both

2793
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:00,719
at a high level metrics of you know the

2794
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:02,080
link quality

2795
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:03,760
and really it seems like that what's

2796
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:05,760
delivered the packet loss

2797
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:08,239
is a more important metric than the the

2798
01:56:08,239 --> 01:56:10,560
lower level at the you know at layer one

2799
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:12,880
the bit error rate the physical layer so

2800
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:15,119
i

2801
01:56:15,119 --> 01:56:17,920
i i don't really see the need

2802
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:20,960
the advantage of it

2803
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:23,360
and would like to hear from other

2804
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:26,000
operators

2805
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:28,239
yeah randy agreed with me in the chat

2806
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:30,400
that um you know if you if you see post

2807
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:31,920
fact bit errors you just take it out of

2808
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,280
service

2809
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:35,040
yeah so just this is all just echoing

2810
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:36,719
the same thing right then ac is saying

2811
01:56:36,719 --> 01:56:38,639
the same thing uh we'll take it to the

2812
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:39,679
list but

2813
01:56:39,679 --> 01:56:42,639
this may not be that useful

2814
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:45,040
we'll see

2815
01:56:45,679 --> 01:56:48,960
too much information right

2816
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:52,719
so the question now is do we want to try

2817
01:56:52,719 --> 01:56:54,840
and load

2818
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:57,199
itunes uh

2819
01:56:57,199 --> 01:56:59,199
stub link or

2820
01:56:59,199 --> 01:57:01,679
advertisement presentation quickly

2821
01:57:01,679 --> 01:57:04,080
or not

2822
01:57:05,199 --> 01:57:06,960
yeah i i don't know

2823
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:08,880
we only have two minutes but uh yeah why

2824
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,639
not let's do it

2825
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:13,040
okay

2826
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:18,239
my dog's waiting for me to take her for

2827
01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:22,280
a walk because you're in the background

2828
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:27,360
i can't see the screen

2829
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:29,280
yes yes

2830
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:32,560
no no but i kind of

2831
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:34,560
oh okay

2832
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:37,800
i'll stop

2833
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:39,360
okay

2834
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:41,760
yeah so uh let's uh

2835
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,840
so this is the advertise of the stop

2836
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:45,440
link attribute

2837
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:46,560
so

2838
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:49,679
uh so there are many players and many

2839
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:52,000
situations and the sub interface

2840
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,320
interface are used commonly in network

2841
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:56,960
but currently there is no suitable place

2842
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:59,040
to advertise the staff interface and

2843
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:02,239
their associated attributes

2844
01:58:02,239 --> 01:58:05,119
and we we also investigated agreed

2845
01:58:05,119 --> 01:58:08,080
possible solution and

2846
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:10,480
there is no country there is no ceiling

2847
01:58:10,480 --> 01:58:13,440
place so we think it is necessary to

2848
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:16,400
extend the oil pfo and the ice protocol

2849
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:18,800
to transfer the stabling and release the

2850
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:21,440
attributes

2851
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:25,119
and the updated uh content for the

2852
01:58:25,119 --> 01:58:27,360
current contract is

2853
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:28,560
uh

2854
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:31,360
based on the discuss on the main list we

2855
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:34,960
found that the interest

2856
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:37,199
in ospf and the interest digitality

2857
01:58:37,199 --> 01:58:40,400
kelvin isis is a suitable place to

2858
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:42,880
contain such information so we define

2859
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:45,840
the uh sublingually or

2860
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:48,800
or under sub the subtle way to carry the

2861
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:50,639
associated attitude

2862
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:54,080
within osp and i iss

2863
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:57,280
and we also define the link type for the

2864
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:59,840
sub sub link because there are various

2865
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:02,639
types of stub link so we can we need to

2866
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:04,320
further

2867
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:06,239
distinguish them

2868
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:09,520
and the other existing subtlety for the

2869
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:13,199
link attribute can be reused

2870
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:18,400
and we also uh con discuss the

2871
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:20,480
other theory that is the

2872
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:23,520
there is a legacy already defined in rc

2873
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:27,920
36 30 and 30 uh and they we also

2874
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:31,360
investigate the american this theory can

2875
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:34,400
be can be used or not and we think

2876
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:37,760
the such the length of the arena should

2877
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:39,840
be

2878
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:43,119
mainly used for the link within the itv

2879
01:59:43,119 --> 01:59:46,159
protocol but the sub link is not in the

2880
01:59:46,159 --> 01:59:47,920
id protocol and

2881
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:51,280
and the if we use such a sub here the

2882
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:52,719
limit type

2883
01:59:52,719 --> 01:59:54,239
regions uh

2884
01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:56,800
within such a circular way so the should

2885
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:59,440
also philosophy should be extended

2886
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:00,239
and

2887
02:00:00,239 --> 02:00:02,560
there is no sub theory to describe the

2888
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,440
prefix that associated with the studying

2889
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:06,719
so

2890
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:09,760
based on this consideration we think

2891
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:12,719
it is fine to define my new

2892
02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:14,960
neutral similar theory

2893
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:17,599
to container information for the sub

2894
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:19,920
link

2895
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,880
okay this is the the update the content

2896
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:24,960
and the update of results

2897
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:27,520
i think it's also discussed on the

2898
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:30,480
mainly uh intensely and mainly

2899
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:32,080
we also ask for the

2900
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:34,639
working group to adopt okay

2901
02:00:34,639 --> 02:00:36,000
so

2902
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,880
yeah linda go ahead

2903
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:42,880
this strat seems like we can use that

2904
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:44,560
for distribute the

2905
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:47,440
aggregate costs as well so i'm curious

2906
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:48,239
um

2907
02:00:48,239 --> 02:00:50,320
what's the stop link how's the

2908
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:53,280
difference from like a prefix lsa

2909
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:57,199
um like if is the sampling is always for

2910
02:00:57,199 --> 02:00:59,759
prefix

2911
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:00,880
uh

2912
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:05,920
no no i i think the stop link account

2913
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:08,800
can be used to connect many uh

2914
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:09,760
many

2915
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:11,440
prefix you know

2916
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:14,159
for example in your in your list for the

2917
02:01:14,159 --> 02:01:17,760
5g edge computer uh

2918
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:20,880
i think the sublingualism is linked

2919
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:23,920
that's the located on the boundary of

2920
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:25,280
the

2921
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:26,880
s

2922
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:29,360
so yeah that's that's the interesting

2923
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:31,920
case we're out of time i i'm always i

2924
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:34,159
don't know whether it's appropriate or

2925
02:01:34,159 --> 02:01:37,920
not to run over i think virtual we can

2926
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:41,599
um run over a little bit but

2927
02:01:41,599 --> 02:01:44,480
um it's a little bit better than when

2928
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:47,040
you're no it will it will will not be

2929
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:48,080
cut

2930
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:50,080
automatically so we if we have time we

2931
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:51,599
can discuss it

2932
02:01:51,599 --> 02:01:53,440
continuously

2933
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:54,560
yeah

2934
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:57,199
um i i mean i i would encourage people

2935
02:01:57,199 --> 02:01:59,280
to talk about this on the list this is

2936
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:01,040
another one where

2937
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:02,880
i don't think we're gonna do an adoption

2938
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:05,199
call right now because

2939
02:02:05,199 --> 02:02:07,280
you know um i think there's still some

2940
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:09,440
questions as to whether it's needed

2941
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:11,599
i know as a contributor i

2942
02:02:11,599 --> 02:02:14,560
i don't see why it's needed but

2943
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:15,360
um

2944
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:17,360
you know that's just me as a contributor

2945
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:19,040
but i'd like to see

2946
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:21,040
some more discussion on the list about

2947
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:22,320
this

2948
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:25,119
particularly if people have ideas

2949
02:02:25,119 --> 02:02:27,760
about how to how to um

2950
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:30,000
identify stub links without

2951
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,320
a tlb right because i think that could

2952
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:33,520
be done

2953
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:36,719
so then we wouldn't need this but anyway

2954
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:39,199
more on the list um and i think that's

2955
02:02:39,199 --> 02:02:41,280
it for presentations

2956
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:43,440
yeah i'm just going to add i think the

2957
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:44,800
encoding now

2958
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:47,360
and where it is as a t you know for its

2959
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:50,320
original purpose was for enter aste it's

2960
02:02:50,320 --> 02:02:52,719
in the right place and the encoding is

2961
02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:53,760
fine

2962
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:56,239
the question from my standpoint now is

2963
02:02:56,239 --> 02:02:59,199
whether people think this additional uh

2964
02:02:59,199 --> 02:03:00,560
link type and

2965
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:04,560
information is useful for t

2966
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:10,480
yeah i mean other people other people

2967
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:11,920
than the offers are people other than

2968
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:13,360
the

2969
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:15,440
no operating is useful

2970
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:18,080
but i think we need to buy it

2971
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:21,679
okay great uh thanks everybody um

2972
02:03:21,679 --> 02:03:23,760
any other comments we do have this

2973
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:25,760
virtual time so

2974
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:28,000
uh then we're gonna throw some tomatoes

2975
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,639
at us or

2976
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:34,800
hopefully we'll be meeting in europe i

2977
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:37,920
know they're they're hoping uh in march

2978
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:39,840
i think that would be uh that'd be

2979
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:41,840
really good if we could meet face to

2980
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:43,440
face and

2981
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:44,960
perhaps you know

2982
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:46,960
impromptu side meetings and all the

2983
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:48,400
things were

2984
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:49,360
uh

2985
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:51,199
missing

2986
02:03:51,199 --> 02:03:53,440
yep

2987
02:03:54,239 --> 02:03:56,560
okay okay

2988
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:58,000
thank you thanks everyone i think it was

2989
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,639
a good meeting

2990
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:04,040
thank you

2991
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,920
you know actually how much time do they

2992
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:15,760
give us because you know usually we hang

2993
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:18,800
around at the table a few minutes

2994
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:20,960
right like is that maybe we should use

2995
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:24,880
our overtime for that kind of

2996
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:26,800
they want us to go together i think

2997
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:29,040
right

2998
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:31,280
ah

2999
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:33,440
i think i got another plan

3000
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:36,840
it's recorded here so

3001
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:39,520
yeah it's not recorded at the end of the

3002
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:41,360
session when you're just gathered around

3003
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:43,599
the chair table

3004
02:04:43,599 --> 02:04:46,239
uh john says running over is not ideal i

3005
02:04:46,239 --> 02:04:47,119
agree

3006
02:04:47,119 --> 02:04:48,639
that's always been my thought is that

3007
02:04:48,639 --> 02:04:50,239
people

3008
02:04:50,239 --> 02:04:52,639
need to plan and it disadvantages people

3009
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:54,719
that have other things to do

3010
02:04:54,719 --> 02:04:59,320
all right everybody thanks bye thanks
