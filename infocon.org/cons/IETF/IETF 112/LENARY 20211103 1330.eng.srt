3
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,600
minute or two for any stragglers to uh

4
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,520
to join

5
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,280
and you can indicate whether my audio is

6
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,640
still okay since i had to log out and

7
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,120
log back in

8
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,040

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,720
thank you hi let's all tell lars we can

11

hear him

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,960
yeah we can do the equivalent of a mail

13
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,880
bomb and just everybody reply to me that

14
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,479
they can hear me fine and then we'll

15
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,080
fill the plenary that way how's that

16
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,320
right while we're waiting uh to really

17
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,880
really get started you uh can look at

18
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,479
the slide that alexa has helpfully

19
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,040
forwarded um for some tips on how to use

20
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,880
meet echo which is the system by which

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,720
you are joining the session

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,880
um so basically you will be muted and

23
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,560
your video will be off and you need to

24
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,960
unmute yourself and turn your video on

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,320
when you get into the cube please do

26
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,000
turn the video on if you can do it at

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,920
all i think it's nice

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,840
to actually see each other in this

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,960
virtual

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,000
future

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,159
um if you have a headset you can use one

32
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,119
um

33
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,360
i do have one but i prefer not to that's

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,320
why i asked whether the audio is okay um

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,840
and there's some more details if you get

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,920
really bored during this plenary um you

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,399
can click on that link or

38
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,639
copy that link into your browser if it's

39
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,840
doable and

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,520
look at that

41
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,959
all right i think it's a couple minutes

42
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,840
uh past 3 30 my time which is in finland

43
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,319
so for me this is a great time zone

44
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,480
um my apologies and condolences to all

45
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,000

51
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,400

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,959
next slide please

54
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,680
eggert i'm the itf chair since uh march

55
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,280
of this year um we have a reasonably um

56
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,400
short agenda this time um which means we

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,120
have lots of time for open mic or we can

58
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,680
have a really short plenary as you wish

59
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,640
um

60
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,519
we have the usual uh round of updates

61
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,159
from the various bodies and roles um

62
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,239
all of them have published or in the

63
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,920
process of publishing longer written

64
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,280
reports

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,360
that are mostly linked to from the itf

66
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,640
report that i shared earlier so you can

67
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,840
find them from there i think there's

68
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,760
also links in the various slide decks

69
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,040

70
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,400

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,680

things about our currently running

116
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
experiments because as we put together

117
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,199
the report

118
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,720
the written report we realize there's

119
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,000
quite a few of them and maybe not

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,800
everybody is aware what's going on

121
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,639
there's a already said there's more

122
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,000
topics that we're covering online i have

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,400
some pointers to that um we have a slide

124
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,199
about um the tools.itf.org transition

125
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,320
and we have a slide about the emoter

126
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,440
activities

127
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,840
next slide

128
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,080
please right so as of uh second of

129
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,160
november um which is not quite today i

130
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,039
think

131
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,000
um

132
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,759
we had a 1037 registrations and 210

133
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,240
people used the fee waiver uh 200 people

134
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
participated in the hackathon which is

135
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,440
as usual a large number in 17 projects

136
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,759
which again as usual is a large number

137
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,120
um the breakdown also unsurprisingly is

138
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,800
um pretty us heavy um

139
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,560
given that the time zones work like i

140
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,400
would say okayish for for the u.s this

141
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,639
time and also for europe other regions

142
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,160
of the world unfortunately are a little

143
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,479
bit uh in a difficult situation but

144
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,320
that's why we rotate

145
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,080
um and we're gonna post detailed

146
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,840
attendance stats as always after the

147
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,080
meeting especially since the plenary is

148
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,400
happening before the meeting week so we

149
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,080
are probably going to pick up a few more

150
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,400
late registrations as we

151
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,080
move towards next week next slide

for how this plenary experiment has been

170
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,160
going for you

171
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,759
the experiment being that the plenary is

172
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,599
not part of the meeting week we moved it

173
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,720
a week before so we can uh open up some

174
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,840
working group

175
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,000
slots for the meeting

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,759
and then um we have the schmoon working

177
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,160
group in the gen area which um

178
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,479
is busy writing up guidance documents

179
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,680
that informs the um llc and and others

180
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,919
involved in planning the meetings on

181
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,000
some uh guidelines that the community

182
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,680
wants to give them uh schmooze

183
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,440
rechartering at the moment so if you

184
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,960
haven't paid attention you might want to

185
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,520
drop in next week um and there's a bunch

186
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,280
of documents that are in progress or

187
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,400
finished

188
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,160
about what kind of guidance we're giving

189
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,240
and the list is the many couches list at

190
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,160
itf.org

191
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,960
next slide please

192
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,120
right so i said we have a bunch of

193
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,280
experiments running um first and

194
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,479
foremost i mentioned the plenary

195
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,199
experiment which is um

196
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,400
the goal is to free up um

197
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
session time for working groups during

198
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,680
the itf week as you recall in this fully

199
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,000
online format we run shorter days than

200
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,039
we do

201
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,800
in an in-person meeting we only have six

202
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,199
hours of meeting time each day and that

203
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,800
really limits the amount of working

204
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
groups that we can schedule and since

205
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,639
the plenary is scheduled across all

206
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,280
parallel tracks by moving the plenary

207
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,800
outside the meeting weeks we can free up

208
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,280
i think eight or nine uh session slots

209
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,599
um which i think was very helpful um to

210
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,840
get an agenda that has maybe fewer

211
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,360
conflicts than normal i would

212
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,000
optimistically say if you don't agree uh

213
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
put that in the survey and also put

214
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,520
anything else related to this plenary

215
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,960
experiment and the survey that jay is

216
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,039
going to send out

217
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,479
i want to apologize to the people at

218
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,960
nanak we dropped the ball on on making

219
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,560
sure that we wouldn't conflict with

220
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,960
anything um i thought we had done it but

221
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,639
apparently we didn't and we missed that

222
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,200
nano is happening this week um hopefully

223
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,039
it's got not gonna be a terrible problem

224
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,719
but for those of you at nanak i'm very

225
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,159
sorry that you had to get up early and

226
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,399
then still do the whole full net up day

227
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,799
um after this is all right

228
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,839
um

229
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,839
we also are doing an online welcome

230
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,519
reception i think this is the first time

231
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,440
we're doing this in this virtual format

232
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,959
uh which happens right after this

233
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,440
plenary ends um so look at the agenda

234
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,880
and there are links and i think the last

235
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,720
slide of this presentation also has

236
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,600
links

237
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,839
this happens in gather.town which you

238
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,440
may or may not have joined which is this

239
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,519
sort of virtual forum in which you can

240
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,279
interact with groups of other

241
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,360
participants um i think this will be

242
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,640
pretty exciting we're trying to sort of

243
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,880
recreate the actual welcome reception

244
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,040
that we have in person meetings

245
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,519
um and one part of that uh has been the

246
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,519
hot rfc session that aaron fox been

247
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,360
running for a while and we're bringing

248
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,440
hot rfc back for this meeting in a

249
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,760
virtual form it's also in gather dot

250
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,560
town um also after the

251
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,040
plenary ends so um

252
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,880
go and check out there's some some

253
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,959
billboards and people are

254
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,120
gonna talk about their proposals for itf

255
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,279
related work um

256
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,399
and i think that should be pretty

257
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,839
interesting i'm happy to see that we

258
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,000
managed to bring that into a virtual

259
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,519
forum

260
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,800
um we're for a number of meetings now um

261
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,080
had the running experiments with

262
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,959
scheduling uh the buff deadlines a

263
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,120
little bit differently so that the isg

264
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,800
and iab have the opportunity to give

265
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,279
feedback to the people um preparing

266
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,160
buffs

267
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,480
in sort of the end result hoping that

268
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,399
the buff will be better planned and

269
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,040
better run um if you

270
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,560
think this is going well please let us

271
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,160
know if you think you would rather have

272
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,560
the one week or two weeks back uh and we

273
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,320
should push the go back to a single

274
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,399
deadline and move it further back let us

275
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,640
know as well

276
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,160
um

277
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,000
at the moment we are running an

278
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,399
experiment in terms of eligibility for

279
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,079
the itf nomcom this is defined in rfc

280
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:26,720
8989

281
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,640
um the reason for this is that the

282
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,760
original non-com eligibility rules um

283
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,760
only extend eligibility to people who've

284
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,440
participated in the last three out of

285
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,279
five physical meetings

286
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,640
and since we're not having physical

287
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,279
meetings we decided to count um

288
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,040
participation in virtual meetings such

289
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,600
as this one towards noncom eligibility

290
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,200
and there's also different other tracks

291
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,519
by which one can qualify for the numcom

292
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,200
become eligible for the num code one is

293
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,760
being a chair and the other ones being a

294
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,640
document author of a recent document

295
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,519
um

296
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,959
we've run that experiment for uh one

297
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,720
cycle already so the

298
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,440
current mom com ran under that uh

299
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,519
under that extended eligibility

300
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,320
and we published a result um based on it

301
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,480
and the isg has decided to extend

302
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,000
the experiment for another year which is

303
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,200
one of the options in rfc 8989 um the

304
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,040
reason being or one reason being that it

305
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,320
was quite unclear why some of the tracks

306
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
um weren't so successful in qualifying

307
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,880
people when they were intended to be

308
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,480
much more successful based on data we

309
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,000
had when rfc 8989 was written and rather

310
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,920
than speculate we decided to gather more

311
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,079
data the other more pragmatic reason is

312
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,399
that we're still in an all virtual forum

313
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,040
and so at the very least we have to keep

314
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,120
counting virtual attendance or

315
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,760
attendance to virtual meetings as long

316
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,279
uh eligibility require

317
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,360
qualifying uh because otherwise we have

318
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,639
trouble seeding in mom come next year

319
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,360
and finally the isg has decided to do an

320
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,440
experiment of doing sort of a 360 degree

321
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,440
reviews for ads

322
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,519
and we just got the

323
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,320
first set of results basically we asked

324
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,160
each other we asked the iab we asked the

325
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,480
secretariat we asked our chairs and uh

326
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,279
document authors as well as um

327
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,600
other document also that we balloted on

328
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
uh to sort of give us feedback in sort

329
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,639
of a set of short web forms um we get

330
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,920
some interesting feedback from the

331
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,440
community that we should revamp the

332
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,680
questionnaire if we do this again which

333
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,160
will take into account but i still think

334
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,920
we got some personally i would say i got

335
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,600
some interesting data out of this so the

336
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
idea is that every ad gets their own

337
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,480
review um and and it's not shared with

338
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,800
the rest of the isg the entire isg gets

339
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,959
sort of an aggregated view which

340
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,480
averages all

341
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,959
the individual feedback and that

342
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,360
aggregate view um we're planning on

343
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,120
publishing since we just got it this

344
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,279
might take a week or two

345
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,120
but you can then all see what the

346
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,279
feedback was on on the isg as a whole

347
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,720
and that's about the currently running

348
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,639
experiments next slide please

349
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,440
right we had zero appeals which is uh

350
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,839
great as usual and we published one isg

351
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,680
statement which is the aforementioned

352
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,040
report on the rfc 8989 experiment it has

353
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,320
a bunch of data in it so if you're

354
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,720
wondering exactly why we are continuing

355
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,160
it please give that a read if you

356
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,920
haven't already

357
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,639
and there are much more reports that i

358
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,200
go into detail online

359
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
on the data tracker materials page for

360
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,120
this meeting and as always there's an

361
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,279
itr blog that greg is

362
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,600
filling with interesting content so if

363
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,000
you wonder what's going on that's a good

364
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,160
source to take a peek at as well

365
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,959
next slide please

366
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,760
okay about tools so um

367
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,600
there was an announcement in may that

368
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,199
the services that are currently running

369
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,680
at the tools.itf.org url are being

370
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,920
replaced and we're going to wind that

371
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,880
down

372
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,240
it's probably going to happen before

373
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,000
itf-113

374
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
the original goal was to do it before

375
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,560
this itf but it was a bit more complex

376
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,880
than was anticipated and so we we're

377
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,680
moving that by a meeting

378
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,880
there's a few uh um tools that are sort

379
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,320
of um

380
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,800
still waiting to be replaced probably

381
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,680
um

382
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,519
the xml to rfc

383
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,639
page

384
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,800
is the most visible of those there is an

385
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,560
authors.idf.org

386
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,720
beta that you can take a look at which

387
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,639
is intending to replace this

388
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,079
but we need still need to do a little

389
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,839
bit of work on the bibxml and the

390
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,079
conversion service before that's fully

391
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,279
there

392
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,120
there's a whole uh

393
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,240
slew of other tools that were

394
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,600
made available under tools.itf.org

395
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,199
for almost all um that have a sort of

396
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,399
sizeable

397
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,920
community that uses them we have a

398
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,160
transition plan there's a github url

399
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,480
here that you can take a look at but i

400
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,480
also want to be clear that we we can't

401
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,839
maintain all tools that were under

402
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,360
tools.itf.org going forward

403
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
because we have limited resources and

404
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,920
some of the tools specifically written

405
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
um oftentimes for a very small community

406
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,120
i think we have one or two tools that

407
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,320
were specifically written for one

408
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,519
participant

409
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,120
and and i hope it's clear that we are

410
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,639
not going to be able to maintain those

411
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,399
going forward but we're going to try our

412
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,639
best and if you have feedback on on the

413
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,040
plan please go to that github page and

414
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,399
of open issues or send email to tools

415
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,839

directory called emorder which is

419
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,120
the new home for the edu team activities

420
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,199

can go back to hybrid meetings sometime

454
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,040

focusing on technical work the iab is

477
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,039

481
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,640
to the next slide

482
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,640
yeah i just want to take um this

483
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,039
opportunity here in the admin planner to

484
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,039
do a couple of announcements

485
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,760
so one is about a workshop that the iab

486
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,080
is holding end of november and this

487
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,640
workshop is focusing on analyzing ietf

488
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,000
data so what we want to do here is to

489
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,679
bring together the researchers and

490
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,440
engineers that are working already on

491
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,640
looking at like for example

492
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,240
participation trends

493
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,880
um and or author trends or author groups

494
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,799
and these kind of things and bringing

495
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,480
everybody in the room understanding what

496
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
we know about the ietf already and what

497
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,880
else we can learn from the data i'm sure

498
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,720
there will be some interesting insights

499
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,320
about what happened during the last two

500
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,880
years what changed during the pandemic

501
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,960

actually driven by the community

522
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,440

okay and then

545
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,880
another announcement uh is that adrian

546
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,679
farrell is decided to step down as the

547
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,240
independent submission editor

548
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,400
his term will end in february um next

549
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,280
year

550
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,320
and

551
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,240
we probably have another chance to thank

552
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,919
him at the next meeting in march and

553
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,600
hopefully in person

554
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,840
but i already want to say very much

555
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,760
thank you to adrian i think he has done

556
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,400
a great job in this position by trying

557
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,960
to to make sure that like all voices are

558
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,799
heard in our community and discussion is

559
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,200
ongoing and like also i talked to him

560
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,919
and he said he's kind of also um

561
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,520
working a lot with newcomers and

562
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,200
providing invite advice to them so in

563
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,559
that sense i think this is a really

564
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,640
important position and he has done a

565
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,200
very good job and is very encouraged and

566
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,960
cares a lot about this so thanks a lot

567
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,720
adrian

568
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,679
but he decided to step down and make

569
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,600
some room for somebody new

570
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,520
um so we're looking for candidates right

571
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,720
now

572
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,240
as i said i think this is a very

573
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,640
important position in our community

574
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,919
and i think it can also be very

575
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,280
interesting of course there is a little

576
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,039
bit of work here to do

577
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,760
but if you're interested please let us

578
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,799
know

579
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,280
i think adrian is also available to talk

580
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,039
to if you want to learn more about this

581
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,559
because he has all the first-hand

582
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,320
information i can probably only point

583
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,120
you to the rc where this role is defined

584
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,960
if you reach out to me

585
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,880
but i believe adrian is also available

586
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,200
for questions so please consider this

587
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,120
position

588
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,799
okay and then

589
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,120
we go to my last slide

590
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,679
um this is also uh the point where i

591
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,520
want to thank you some of our community

592
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,000
members who have taken up some roles

593
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,559
um we just seated somebody new on the

594
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,520
icann

595
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,120
committee

596
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,440
we had two very qualified

597
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,640
candidates and vittorio batala is taking

598
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,480
the position thanks a lot for that this

599
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,760
position is actually quite some

600
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,320
effort so it's not easy to find people

601
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,120
thanks a lot a lot for that

602
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,840
there is a little bit of news about

603
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,760
the saw management so

604
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,600

years in the position of the zone

606

um he's already retired for a while so

608
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,880
he asked us a while ago actually to step

609
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,400
down in this position and we finally

610
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,159
managed to find somebody

611
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,080

614
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,400

616
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,840
and then also

617
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,679
big thanks and welcome to peter cough

618
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,840
serving uh in this position from now on

619
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
and then the final thing i want to

620
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
mention here is that we are again as

621
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,080
every year are looking for a new person

622
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,520
for the um icefock board of trustees

623
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,520
um so far richard once was serving in

624
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,000
this position and he reached um

625
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,240
his term limit after six years so thanks

626
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,919
a lot richard for serving in this

627
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,240
position so we are looking for a new

628
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,520
candidate

629
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,679
um again this is the position that has a

630
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,760
real time commitment and but it's also

631
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,480
very interesting position i think

632
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,799
you uh learn a lot about what what's

633
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,960
happening in isoc and you can actually

634
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,120
also impact there

635
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,919
and we as the iab serve as the interface

636
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,080
to isoc so we actually do

637
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,919
get a lot of input about what ice work

638
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,280
is doing i personally find it very

639
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,799
interesting i don't have all this

640
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,240
knowledge about

641
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,400
the politics behind but it's always good

642
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,000
to understand what what's happening in

643
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,480
policy and and what other views are so

644
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,240
this is really definitely something

645
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,039
where eyestock is important

646
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,440
um we are we are really looking for you

647
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
to put your name in last time we had a

648
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,039
very good set of candidates i think we

649
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,679
had like eight or ten candidates um but

650
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,600
diversity of that set of people was

651
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,640
really really low so it was really um

652
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,799
just people from the u.s it was only

653
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,279
male people and it was only white people

654
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,480
um so um icelock is discussing diversity

655
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,159
a lot and they tried to fill their board

656
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,760
with a diverse set of people because

657
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,679
isaac has like all the chapters very

658
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,279
international as well

659
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,600
um but i think we should also support

660
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,480
them in trying to to provide them a more

661
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,159
diverse candidate than we had in the

662
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,840
past maybe

663
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,400
um so i'm i'm really looking for

664
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,120
people to nominate their self or maybe

665
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,960
think about people who would serve very

666
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,120
well in this position and ping them try

667
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,440
to convince people to put their name in

668
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440

779
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,720
the former rfc editor so i'm i'm

780
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,919
sort of i'm keeping keeping the

781
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,000
documents flowing next document please

782
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,279
next yes next page please

783
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,919
we have been publishing rfcs in xml for

784
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,720
a year and a half we publish 461 of them

785
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,399
the process is working pretty well i

786
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,399
mean there's some nits the pdfs page

787
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,919
breaks still aren't beautiful but the

788
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,240
html and text versions are working

789
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,520
pretty well

790
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,399
um

791
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,080
and again since the

792
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,000
since the process is the xml is

793
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,600
canonical and the rendered versions are

794
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,200
not as we improved the rendering we can

795
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,320
fix it

796
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,559
um it took a while for the production

797
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,640
people to learn the ins and outs of xml

798
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,080
but they have done so

799
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,760
um we are back to the service level

800
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,279
agreement that we had before and they're

801
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,200
meeting the service level agreement um

802
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,000
so

803
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,600
so although they're putting more work

804
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,480
into it they stepped up so that rfcs are

805
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,000
now being published as fast as they were

806
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
before we switch to xml

807
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,559
next please

808
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,520
um what i'm still trying to work on are

809
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,200
the tools i mean

810
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,360
the uh a lot of drafts are still being

811
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,399
being submitted in version 2 xml even

812
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,399
though v3 is what we publish in and v3

813
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,399
is in fact stable and usable some of the

814
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,080
tools aren't complete um i have the

815
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,840
discussions about like do we need to do

816
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,440
we need an xml diff do we need other

817
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,640
tools to make it

818
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,200
to make svg work better and things like

819
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,000
that

820
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,440
um we're also having a lot of

821
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,960
discussions i mean a lot of people write

822
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,799
stuff in markdown do we want to do we

823
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,320
want to support markdown tools that have

824
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,480
an entire markdown

825
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,159
um tool chain

826
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,840
we're also doing some experiments in

827
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,640
auth 48 anybody who's done an rfc knows

828
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,039
that in in in auth 48 there's a great

829
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,720
deal of email back and forth between the

830
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,559
authors and the editors

831
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,039
um confirming the changes and and and

832
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,880
approving stuff that there's clearly

833
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,159
room for automation there we've been

834
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,760
doing some experiments in github for

835
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,279
people who like github

836
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,520
uh and as i said we also might want to

837
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,840
advance and and we might want to change

838
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,799
and do

839
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,440
and make markdown and an alternative

840
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,960
input this is all stuff that we're still

841
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,720
looking at next please

842
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,760
um

843
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,799
when we went from v2 to v3 um the v3

844
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,960
vocabulary was known to be sort of

845
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,279
retentive we expected some changes um

846
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,960
the changes have all been pretty small

847
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,600
and with one change about except for one

848
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,960
change for postal addresses everything

849
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,919
is going to be

850
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,440
is going to be backwards compatible so

851
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,600
if you use the vocabulary described in

852
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,279
rfc 7991 that's valid that will work

853
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,679
um when when we back out some of the

854
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,559
postal changes um i this is something i

855
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,919
need to discuss with the community but i

856
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,679
would like to reissue the xml changing

857
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,240
the codes not the text but the codes so

858
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,320
that all of the canonical xml actually

859
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,440
matches the final version of the

860
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,799
vocabulary

861
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,360
and we also have a lot of issues with

862
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,200
svg it turns out we backed the wrong

863
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,320
horse the the the profile of svg we use

864
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,240
is one that's it's nobody uses it's

865
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,679
abandonware

866
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,840
and the tools have we have trouble

867
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,360
producing xvg that matches our profile

868
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,799
and the question is do we need to change

869
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,240
the tools or change the profile or

870
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,720
something um so we're talking about that

871
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,039
so the svg subset will likely change too

872
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,480
but again this is a this is a minor

873
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,880
evolution you know if you lots of people

874
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,480
have produced dot

875
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,480
produced rfcs with perfectly good svg

876
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,360
both line diagrams and equations

877
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,320
um

878
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,600
next please and i think that's it

879
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,399
yep so thank you

880
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,120
hello um so my name is gabriel

881
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,600
montenegro i'm nom come chair next slide

882
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,600
please

883
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,799
so i have a very short presentation only

884
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,720
three slides of which two really are

885
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,640
content the first and foremost is uh i

886
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,559
need we need feedback uh there was a

887
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,919
recent

888
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,159
call for community feedback that i sent

889
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,120
out

890
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,279
this is a continuation of that

891
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,519
we need feedback here's a very very easy

892
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,399
way

893
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,840
i'll go to this link on the data tracker

894
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,679
non-com slash 2021 slash feedback

895
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,840
you click on that you'll see the names

896
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,320
of all the nominees you can click on

897
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,399
all the names or

898
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,559
the names you know better provide

899
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,840
feedback on them

900
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,880
there's also a quote unquote topics at

901
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,080
the very bottom of that page don't miss

902
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,000
it if you have feedback that is not

903
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
specific to any given

904
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,519
nominee you can provide it there

905
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,399
but uh be mindful of the scope

906
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,760
this is feedback that is useful to the

907
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,960
non-com 2021 it's not general feedback

908
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,039
it's not a general discussion

909
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,559
uh facility

910
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,159
uh basically

911
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,159
this stems out from the fact that all of

912
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,440
this is

913
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,919
highly confidential this will only be

914
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,960
shared and seen within the nom-com

915
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,559
there are 17 members you can see them on

916
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,880
the long-haul page who they are

917
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,720
so these are the only people who will

918
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,320
see that feedback

919
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,519
so of course again don't think that the

920
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,120
general or topics capability is a it's a

921
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,279
general uh discussion for that you can

922
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,840
go to other venues like you know the itf

923
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,679
mailing list or wherever

924
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,360
uh so please help us reflect the

925
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,960
community give us feedback i would be

926

cisco and juniper that really helps us

1008
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,240
with um running the network for the

1009
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,800
in-person meetings um so we'll begin to

1010
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,320
start seeing that

1011
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,720

1012
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,200

running code sponsor cn nick

1022
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,839
as you'll see our new set of

1023
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,200
sponsorships um

1024
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,920
bring about um

1025
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,320
a substantial amount of um

1026
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,119
ongoing support from these companies

1027
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,960
because i think we've managed to get the

1028
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,320
point where we're aligning with the

1029
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,400
values of these organizations well

1030
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,720
and people are comfortable supporting us

1031
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,078
thank you next slide please

1032
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,400
so thank you to the many generous

1033
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,480
volunteers who make this happen

1034
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,119
we had a code sprint last week focused

1035
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,560
on performance of the data tracker and

1036
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,520
we had lots of people involved there

1037
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,200
looking hard at that stuff so thank you

1038
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,880
very much for that

1039
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,119
and thank you to the knock who continued

1040
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,960
to provide our significant support such

1041
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,800
as during this meeting and thank you

1042
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,040
particularly to their employers who

1043
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,520
provide their time to us for free for us

1044
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,520
to for them to work on

1045
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,599
ietf related things that's very generous

1046
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,800
of them

1047
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,359
next slide please

1048
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,119
um so i'm going to go with all here but

1049
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,280
i've listed out all everyone who's part

1050
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,800
of the team that hasn't been thanked so

1051
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,320
far so we have the

1052
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,200
secretariat team we have the not

1053
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,160
contractors meet echo which is

1054
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,359
obviously crucial for us we have the llc

1055
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,119
staff which have grown a little bit and

1056
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,400
we have the

1057
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,640
contracting members of the tools team so

1058
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,839
thank you very much for everyone to

1059
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,680
making this a success

1060
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,240
next slide please

1061
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,000
so

1062
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,720
iatf113

1063
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,920
we are

1064
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,720
close to negotiating a new venue for

1065
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,680
this

1066
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,320
all i can tell you so far is that um it

1067
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,599
is going to be in europe we um have had

1068
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,640
to move away from bangkok due to the

1069
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,200
covert situation there we've been unable

1070
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,079
to find any other alternative venue in

1071
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,520
asia due to largely um restrictions on

1072
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,079
travel and in some cases due to the

1073
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,320
state of the pandemic there

1074
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,400
we've also similarly had to rule out

1075
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,280
north america due to travel restrictions

1076
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,760
and we've therefore been working on

1077
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,480
europe for some time now of course it's

1078
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,400
likely by march that many of the travel

1079
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
restrictions will have changed for those

1080
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,240
um other regions but that's not

1081
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,079
something we can take the risk on we

1082
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,000
need to know now and so we've been

1083
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,040
working

1084
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,720
in a number of countries in europe and

1085
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,520
we are close to being able to sign

1086
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,359
somewhere and give you good news about

1087
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,160
that

1088
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,839
um so that

1089
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,920
i think will hopefully be the first

1090
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,520
meeting that we're all able to have

1091
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,440
together we're aiming for a smaller

1092
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,200
meeting than normal

1093
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,480
probably capping out around 650 people

1094
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,480
rather than what might be sort of an

1095
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,880
1100 plus meeting which we think is

1096
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,880
reasonable given the um

1097
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,319
reluctance that some people will still

1098
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,680
have to travel and the practical

1099
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,000
difficulties that some people will still

1100
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,359
feature um still struggle with and then

1101
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:56,880
but then we're going to ramp up again

1102
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,319
for the middle of the year and later in

1103
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,480
the year for the meetings to

1104
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,319
enable us to get back to

1105
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,720
normal sized meetings again relatively

1106
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,400
soon we hope

1107
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,200
next slide please

1108
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,800
and so finally thank you to all of our

1109
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,520
global hosts so our global hosts make a

1110
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,680
commitment to us of

1111
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,240
generally six years where they agree to

1112
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,040
fund us throughout those six years and

1113
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,839
to

1114
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,640
sponsor one or to be the host meeting

1115
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,400
host for at least one meeting or two

1116
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
meetings during that period of time so

1117
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,599
these are people who made long-term

1118
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,040
commitments to us and many of them have

1119
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,560
been making for some years having

1120
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,599
renewed

1121
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,240
um at least once so thank you to cisco

comcast ericsson huawei juniper nbc

1124
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,400
next slide please

1125
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,440
so this is all we have so far about the

1126
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,359
future um meeting locations and venues

1127
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,640
we

1128
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,160
we are we as you'll notice we have a

1129
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,560
number of slots open um one in 2022 um

1130
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,359
in

1131
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,680
november we are close to negotiating

1132
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,440
somewhere for that

1133
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,040
the asia slots in 116 um itf 116 we're

1134
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,359
also close to negotiating someone there

1135
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,119
that the reason we haven't done those is

1136
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,000
that generally we need to do site visits

1137
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,640
and we need the hotels to be up and

1138
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,440
operational and functional for us to do

1139
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,599
business with them and

1140
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,119
the hotels have really only started

1141
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,800
coming back on stream in the last few

1142
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,960
months so

1143
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,200
that has been problematic

1144
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,800
until now and for mike's

1145
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,240
comment in the chat to know the dates

1146
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,760
haven't changed those are still the same

1147
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,800
dates

1148
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,800
we did look at changing the dates to see

1149
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,400
whether that helped availability but

1150
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,240
there was no reason to do that and so no

1151
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,720
we haven't changed that

1152
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,960
and then looking further you'll see that

1153
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,480
we've rebooked vancouver later on and

1154
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,880
my tf-119 of course we've had an

1155
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,400
asian cancellation that we're looking to

1156
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,359
try to rebook as well so this

1157
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,040
schedule should hopefully fill up quite

1158
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,839
soon

1159
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,040
thank you next slide please

1160
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,520
registration numbers uh for ietf 1012 as

1161
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,400
of the 2nd of november we're doing quite

1162
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,040
well here as you'll see

1163
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,640
the

1164
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,160
we're generally quite

1165
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,640
conservative about our estimates and

1166
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,400
we are getting better and better about

1167
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,240
these these are coming in quite close to

1168
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,880
our expected numbers if you take the fee

1169
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,760
waivers off the um the budget uh

1170
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,680
generally works out quite well for us

1171
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,280
and particularly want to thank those

1172
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,160
people who we know who deliberately wait

1173
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,400
to register until there's a late fee so

1174
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,880
that they can pay us more to support us

1175
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,800
thank you very much for that

1176
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,680

um hello everyone my name is lee

1203
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,359
berkeley shaw and i'm the new director

1204
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,920
of development at ietf llc

1205
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,520
i've been charged with overseeing

1206
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,119
fundraising activities with special

1207
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,200
emphasis on the endowment

1208
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,599
i've been here a little over four months

1209
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,119
and while i've met with some of you i

1210
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,720
look forward to getting getting to know

1211
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,800
you all better and hopefully in person

1212
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,839
soon

1213
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,599
i wanted to take a brief opportunity to

1214
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,000
mention the ietf endowment for those who

1215
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,760
don't know it was originally set up in

1216
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,280
2012 and the iutf llc assumed the legal

1217
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,640
and administrative home in 2018. the

1218
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,480
endowment is a designated investment

1219
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,839
fund created in support of the itf and

1220
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,319
its activities and it is intended to

1221
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,240
ensure the long-term sustainability of

1222
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,680
the ietf

1223
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,520
this is really important as the

1224
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,440
sponsorships and registrations

1225
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,520
associated with the meetings essentially

1226
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,640
cover those costs of hosting them and as

1227
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,800
such ietf is currently being supported

1228
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,880
almost exclusively not entirely but

1229
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,359
almost by the internet society and as

1230
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:48,960
many of you know our relationship with

1231
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,520
isoc is strong and we hope to have that

1232
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,760
our support long into the future but

1233
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,160
it's not prudent for any organization to

1234
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,200
be solely dependent on any single entity

1235
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,280
the hope is that this endowment will

1236
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,760
allow a home for a variety of donors and

1237
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,599
thanks to both a generous pledge of

1238
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,160
matching funds by the internet society

1239
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,000
and the interest accrued over time in

1240
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,440
the endowment

1241
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,240
it will help diversify ietf financially

1242
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,160
and ultimately help us become

1243
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,400
financially independent

1244
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,079
in my short time here i've been meeting

1245
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,480
with the community to learn about what

1246
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,800
you see as priorities and how you see

1247
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,280
the future for the organization my hope

1248
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,040
is that the endowment will allow us to

1249
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,960
make some of those goals a reality over

1250
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,160
time

1251
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,359
um as such i'm very pleased to announce

1252
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,280
that we have a new gift to the iutf

1253
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,760

1254
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,000

1256
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,520

1257

1259
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,359
aaron and ripe as key donors and their

1260
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,119
gifts will be matched two to one by the

1261
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,200
internet society

1262
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,119
this is really exciting and we hope this

1263
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,960
will be the first of many gifts coming

1264
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,400

session next slide

1313
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,599
so what's the current work that we're uh

1314
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,520
doing since the last meeting a few

1315
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,559
things

1316
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,720
first and foremost um i'll be speaking

1317
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,480
to this later on we've completed the

1318
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,599
iasa 2 3-year retrospective

1319
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:15,520
and i'll have some more slides on that

1320
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,440
uh in a bit

1321
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,880
we also completed a consultation on the

1322
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,200
llc role requirements that we send to

1323
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,440
the nom-com that was some feedback that

1324
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,760
we had received from the prior years in

1325
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,440
oncom and so we put that out to

1326
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,040
community comment

1327
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,960
um over the past few months and then

1328
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,599
sent the updated requirements over to

1329
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,079
the nom-com in august i don't think

1330
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,520
there were any major changes there

1331
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,359
perhaps just these minor tweaks

1332
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,200
item number three

1333
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,960
this is an interesting one that just

1334
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,640
came up um

1335
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,480
one or two board meetings ago you know

1336
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,119
we've only just adopted an investment

1337
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,240
policy

1338
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,559
but our advisor goldman sachs has

1339
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,599
recommended potential changes to those

1340
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,160
um and we'll be considering those we've

1341
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,920
started to look at their their

1342
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,079
recommendations and we're going to

1343
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,800
at the next board meeting

1344
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,040
in december

1345
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,760
have an independent you know advisor

1346
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,760
kind of facilitate a discussion and

1347
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,599
there are two things which are notable

1348
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,440
that they're recommending one

1349
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,599
they've recommended that we increase our

1350
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,839
allocation or exposure to equity

1351
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,359
investments

1352
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,520
to be perhaps a bit more

1353
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,160
aggressive from that standpoint

1354
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,400
but number two have recommended that we

1355
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,480
consider adding private equity

1356
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,680
investments

1357
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,000
and to date we focus really on low-cost

1358
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,160
investments with the idea that you know

1359
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,680
we can't really beat the market but we

1360
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,920
can control our cost of investing and so

1361
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,079
if we can keep those costs slow

1362
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,000
um you know that's a way to you know eek

1363
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,599
out better returns

1364
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,720
in this case you know private equity is

1365
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,520
uh certainly less liquid and higher cost

1366
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,920
from a fees standpoint but potentially

1367
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,559
offers higher returns

1368
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,720
we're not sure you know we're just

1369
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,480
learning about the recommendations and

1370
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,640
plan to dive into that a bit more

1371
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,680
you know i think

1372
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,280
you know no change is is the most likely

1373
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,680
default position here meaning we've you

1374
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,680
know just a year or so adopted the

1375
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,520
investment policy statement

1376
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,280
um but we're looking at it nonetheless

1377
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,440
because they are the advisors and and

1378
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,720
you know we're willing to listen to

1379
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,640
whatever they recommend

1380
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,040
and consider it so stay tuned for that

1381
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:27,920
um

1382
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,000
and we'll see what happens

1383
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,240
and then of course item number four

1384
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,599
um lots of work with uh with jay as the

1385
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,119
executive director

1386
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:39,520
you know the secretary at isg

1387
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,000
iabi rtf and so on

1388
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,240
knock team um you know the different

1389
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,000
technical vendors to see

1390
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,760
what we need to do to get ready for our

1391
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,160
first hybrid meeting in march

1392
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,480
again nice to have a bit more time than

1393
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,480
when the pandemic first struck to have

1394
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,720
that transition to online only

1395
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,960
so uh you know some some work is going

1396
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,480
in there mostly around you know the

1397
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,559
contracting and support for any

1398
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,240
technical investments that might be

1399
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,680
needed next slide please

1400
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,559
so this is the view of the current

1401
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,440
operating budget um really the notable

1402
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,960
thing here is that the current net

1403
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,000
income

1404
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,760
is solely a result of the isoc funding

1405
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,280
the timing of that

1406
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,520
um and so that um

1407
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,400
investment comes uh in december i

1408
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,240
believe so you know the numbers look

1409
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,920
better what we'll plan to do next year

1410
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,920
is to account for that a bit differently

1411
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,480
in the budget so that it doesn't show up

1412
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,960
oddly as we explained earlier in this

1413
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,559
fiscal year

1414
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,520
the way that that got accounted for was

1415
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,280
a bit unexpected and we had to sort

1416
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,400
through that issue

1417
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,559
with our accountants and so we'll

1418
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,640
present that in a an easier to

1419
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,280
understand way for next fiscal year

1420
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,680
which means that you know this timing of

1421
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,880
that one

1422
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,680
large investment will be

1423
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,839
you know more apparent in the budget and

1424
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,400
won't show these distortions up until

1425
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,559
the moment of that investment

1426
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,119
next slide

1427
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,440
so these are all the ways you can get in

1428
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,680
contact with us no changes there next

1429
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,839
slide

1430
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,200
all right so let's do a very quick

1431
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,040
review of the iasa 2 retrospective next

1432
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,359
slide

1433
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:28,559
so a three-year retrospective was

1434
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,160
required by

1435
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:34,880
bcp 101 so that was rfc 8711 that was

1436
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,920
adopted as part of the iasa 2

1437
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,720
you know sort of list of documents

1438
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,559
in april we proposed

1439
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,480
a high-level process for this and a

1440
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,680
timeline

1441
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,960
um and

1442
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,720
you know asked for feedback

1443
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,480
starting then in june we began the

1444
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,040
consultation process by first releasing

1445
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,400
a draft

1446
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,559
document for comment asking a bunch of

1447
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,280
very specific questions as well as

1448
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,559
general ones

1449
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,280
um and then in the june to september

1450
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,400
time frame

1451
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,559
we made a number of revisions to that

1452
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,880
assessment based on community input

1453
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,640
and then we've just

1454
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,720
released a final report

1455
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,960
and so you can take a read through that

1456
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,359
lots of details in there

1457
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:18,880
we'll touch on some of them here next

1458
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,200
slide

1459
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,559
so the feedback mechanisms that we

1460
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,200
included were a number of these this is

1461
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,280
to some extent reflective of the fact

1462
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,440
that you know mailing lists alone are

1463
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,000
not um sufficient for getting feedback

1464
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,079
in the community so we did a mailing

1465
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:37,119
list

1466
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,119
so admin discuss

1467
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:40,160
we had

1468
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,079
all the documents posted on github so

1469
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,920
people could do pull requests or open

1470
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,880
issues

1471
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,839
we held two live webinars for q a

1472
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:51,599
and then we held itf 111 meeting office

1473
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:52,400
hours

1474
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,480
of course we also you know opened up

1475
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,160
regular board meetings for comments as

1476
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,118
well next slide

1477
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,359
so we had 63 specific

1478
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,599
enumerated requirements

1479
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:09,280
61 of those were rated as achieved or on

1480
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,640
track

1481
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,040
two we were noting here as partly

1482
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,520
achieved or in progress

1483
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,079
and those specifically were requirements

1484
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,640
number 50 and 61 so

1485
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,359
improve the ietf's technical environment

1486
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,599
and develop a sustainable funding model

1487
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,400
next slide please

1488
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,079
so on that first requirement 50 improve

1489
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,559
the technical environment i think the

1490
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,559
conclusion there is that much technical

1491
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,319
debt remains i think we're

1492
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,319
all aware of that in the community and

1493
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,480
we can all see as lars mentioned

1494
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,799
a number of the the transitions that are

1495
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,200
happening and focuses on you know

1496
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,200
improving performance and

1497
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,440
you know up resourcing the development

1498
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,520
uh folks that have been brought on and

1499
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,720
so on

1500
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,920
um and you know in essence you know the

1501
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,760
llc has provided the

1502
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,760
executive director with whatever

1503
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,319
financial resources are necessary

1504
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,880
to fill out the team working on that

1505
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,280
and provide whatever resources the folks

1506
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,119
in the community that are working on

1507
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,280
that might need and so you know we

1508
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,119
expect more to come but

1509
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:16,640
you know i think

1510
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,799
looking at it at a very high level it's

1511
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,720
clear that not only is there a lot of

1512
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,480
technical debt but the community is

1513
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,040
really in the midst of a transition to

1514
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,760
you know maybe newer and updated um you

1515
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,480
know tool sets or technical workflow

1516
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,559
processes and so we're here to support

1517
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,880
that and resource it however we can

1518
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,720
but um you know certainly there's you

1519
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,880
know maybe a higher rate of change

1520
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,720
you know over the next few years than

1521
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,720
perhaps the past five

1522
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:47,919
so ongoing in process next slide please

1523
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:50,720
uh so requirement 61 is developing a

1524
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,040
sustainable funding model

1525
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,559
we feel like there's been a lot of

1526
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:57,359
progress here but clearly

1527
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,040
you know this is an area of continued

1528
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,400
focus so

1529
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,400
first and foremost we were you know

1530
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,839
pleased to have the new funding

1531
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:05,760
agreement last year with isaac with the

1532
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,079
great matching program that lee berkeley

1533
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,480
mentioned a moment ago

1534
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,319
and of course thanks again to lac nick

1535
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:14,480
for their new contribution we really

1536
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,680
really appreciate that and the

1537
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,599
leadership they've shown

1538
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,400
um we've revised the sponsorship program

1539
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,240
you know so for example we have

1540
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,240
different types of sponsorships that

1541
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,839
organizations can make some new

1542
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:27,359
opportunities for that

1543
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,240
we revised the endowment policy

1544
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,240
created a sustainable fee plan for the

1545
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,400
online only meetings including fee

1546
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,960
waivers we hired obviously that director

1547
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,040
of development lee berkeley shaw and

1548
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,520
we've been working with the community to

1549
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,079
define what the hybrid the covet excuse

1550
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,799
me impact hybrid meetings may look like

1551
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,960
including what a sustainable fee plan

1552
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,040
may look like and a newer way to

1553
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,319
contract venues for more flexible

1554
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:56,960
sizing if you will and so that's still

1555
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,520
in process where as jay mentioned very

1556
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,400
close to um hopefully a first

1557
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,480
announcement for that march meeting

1558
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,400
um and it's clear that you know going

1559
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,240
forward there needs to be a little bit

1560
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,480
more flexibility on the sizing

1561
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,960
of um you know those venues and how

1562
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,280
those contracts work and so you know

1563
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,280
the team's been adapting to that

1564
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,040
and clearly you know we've only just

1565
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,119
kicked off you know that agreement

1566
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:23,599
framework with isak and that

1567
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:25,599
you know uh you know lee berkeley has

1568
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,440
just been hired so

1569
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,640
you know we didn't feel like we could

1570
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,960
mark that as complete by any means we

1571
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,400
think that we're making substantial

1572
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,559
progress but we've got more work to do

1573
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,000
and this is where there's a lot of board

1574
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,040
focus

1575
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,759
next slide please

1576
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,200
in terms of recommendations for future

1577
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,119
work we included this at the end of the

1578
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,200
retrospective

1579
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,799
first and foremost

1580
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:51,359
we recommend that a periodic assessment

1581
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,599
be repeated essentially every three

1582
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,119
years just like this

1583
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,480
assessment was

1584
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,520
the idea here being to sort of move away

1585
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,760
if we draw an analogy to software

1586
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,599
development move away from waterfowl

1587
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:04,640
development

1588
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,000
to a more agile development model

1589
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,480
and to draw back to iasa instead of

1590
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,960
doing a review like every 10 years and

1591
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,119
then having you know a huge amount of

1592
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:17,680
change that can be very disruptive

1593
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,680
and take away a lot of the focus

1594
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,640
of the organization having smaller

1595
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,960
amounts of change and so sort of driving

1596
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,880
that as a periodic assessment every

1597
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,000
three years

1598
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,920
hopefully can be used as a mechanism to

1599
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,960
make more incremental change and not

1600
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,960
push things off you know in doing it

1601
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,799
once a decade in a much more disruptive

1602
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:39,280
fashion so we recommend

1603
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,720
doing that every three years and that's

1604
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,640
something that the llc will be

1605
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,640
scheduling and driving

1606
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,599
um

1607
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,240
two we recommended making a couple of

1608
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:51,440
modest uh financial planning adjustments

1609
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,280
one during the annual budgeting process

1610
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,119
just updating the target for reserve

1611
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,440
funds and annually reviewing the

1612
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,200
investment policy which we'll be doing

1613
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,680
again um you know late this year as i

1614
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,599
mentioned with the goldman sachs

1615
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:05,520
um sort of prompted

1616
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,119
review of that

1617
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:09,440
and then three

1618
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,559
it seems appropriate that the itf trust

1619
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:15,760
should initiate and lead a consultation

1620
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,599
on their legal structure

1621
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:18,960
just to provide a little bit more

1622
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,400
background on that of course the

1623
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,440
document explains it more but the ietf's

1624
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,960
trust structure is very unique

1625
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,799
and the directors

1626
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,520
of the trust end up being essentially

1627
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,119
personally liable

1628
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,640
uh for

1629
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,640
things related to the trust and so you

1630
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,880
can ensure against that and that's what

1631
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,480
traditionally

1632
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,400
we've done for the trusts in terms of

1633
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,760
providing them funding for those

1634
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,799
policies but it's not possible anymore

1635
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,119
in the way that the insurance for those

1636
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:52,000
uh issues work to increase that policy

1637
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,119
coverage

1638
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,280
and so that really is one of those

1639
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,799
issues that's potentially driving a

1640
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:59,359
change and we really just identify that

1641
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:01,280
this is a potential issue i think the

1642
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,839
trust totally agrees and they're going

1643
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:06,079
to go off and work on a consultation

1644
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,880
about what that might look like and you

1645
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,160
know lead that discussion with the

1646
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,520
community

1647
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,400
um next slide

1648
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,559
so i think that's all for us and uh next

1649
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:20,640
up is the internet architecture board

1650
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,799
thank you

1651
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,800
yes uh so that's me again um

1652
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,000
[Music]

1653
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,319
i believe we have a next slide where we

1654
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,040
have photos of everybody right so no

1655
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,720
not everybody has to turn on the camera

1656
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,240
at the same time you can see all the

1657
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,599
faces and names here um that's

1658
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,280
the iab last you can stay here if you

1659
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,760
want you don't have to disappear

1660
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,200
um

1661
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,520
yeah we have the iab we have lars here

1662
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,760
and we also have colin and john with us

1663
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,000
for any questions so now i should look

1664
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
at the queue and see if there's anybody

1665
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,720
who wants to ask a question

1666
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:09,200
doesn't look like it

1667
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,640
i'm waiting a few more seconds

1668
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,200
but good news is you also and there we

1669
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:21,078
have somebody great andrew

1670
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,559
i believe you should be able to turn on

1671
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,119
your audio and eventually camera on your

1672
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,760
own android

1673
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,319
why is that worked

1674
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,160
that does work

1675
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,000
that marvelous

1676
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,680
i've got a question

1677
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:45,119
about rfc e3890

1678
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:48,400
which the iab public

1679
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:52,940
[Music]

1680
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,799
to do to actually implement

1681
01:02:56,799 --> 01:02:59,039
some of the recommendations

1682
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:00,160
or

1683
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,400
practice that was described in that

1684
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,880
rfc89

1685
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,640
and how might get

1686
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,039
the voice of in youth

1687
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:10,820
um more directly

1688
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,000
[Music]

1689
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,520
into the activities of the idea

1690
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,039
thank you

1691
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:18,799
okay uh thanks for your question you

1692
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,079
were breaking up a little bit but i

1693
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:23,839
think you're talking about rc that um

1694
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:24,799
uh

1695
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:26,880
says that the user intent should be

1696
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,880
considered when designing protocols and

1697
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,720
the question was if you

1698
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,480
if the ib did something to implement

1699
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,280
this

1700
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,480
um

1701
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,440
i'm inviting other ib members to add a

1702
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,799
an opinion here and like even the

1703
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:40,240
authors of the draft who are not on the

1704
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,160
ib anymore

1705
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,000
but like from my point of view this is

1706
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,319
the advice given by the iab for the ietf

1707
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:48,720
community i think it did trigger

1708
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,039
um some discussion in the ietf community

1709
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,799
but to actually take action or implement

1710
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:54,400
something and consider this in protocol

1711
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,480
design and that's something that needs

1712
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,799
to be done in the iatf community itself

1713
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:00,960
and in the protocol development

1714
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,480
process

1715
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,520
and i hand over to tommy

1716
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,400
all right yeah just to comment a little

1717
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,480
bit more yeah miria is right that this

1718
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,359
is mainly advice to that community

1719
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,799
however in the ways in which the ib does

1720
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:21,520
get to give input such as when we're

1721
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,799
doing reviews of buffs and charters

1722
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:26,880
we've noted

1723
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,880
specifically that this document is one

1724
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,440
that we want to kind of have

1725
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,760
on hand and that we will look at and

1726
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,359
review during these times to make sure

1727
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:37,039
that it's something that's in our mind

1728
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,640
and that if we see something that we can

1729
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,559
comment about we will

1730
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,520
so that's what we're doing

1731
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,359
conan go ahead

1732
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,720
yeah i'd also like to um

1733
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,400
note that the iab workshop for

1734
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,280
organizing in november december um

1735
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,280
looking at analyzing the atf data what

1736
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,359
will hopefully give us some idea to what

1737
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:00,960
extent the

1738
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,319
you know the people developing the

1739
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:04,000
standards are representative of the

1740
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,280
broader community

1741
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,280
[Music]

1742
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,240
so so we we can at least understand uh

1743
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,000
whether we are at all representative of

1744
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,400
the end users

1745
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,880
good point

1746
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,119
so um let's move on with the queue we

1747
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:24,079
have aaron in the queue

1748
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:30,319
i see only one buff on the agenda and

1749
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,960
maybe a half dozen side meetings

1750
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,280
i'm wondering is the ib concerned about

1751
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,440
the arrival of new work to the ietf and

1752
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,319
are you

1753
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:39,520
do you have any thoughts on

1754
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,440
[Music]

1755
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,760
you know how to keep the

1756
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,119
intake

1757
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:46,319
uh

1758
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,880
moving along

1759
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:50,799
so i see less already there because i

1760
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:52,720
think um maybe concerned is also not the

1761
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,880
right word but the ieh is talking a lot

1762
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,240
about this

1763
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,680
so last one

1764
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:58,480
yeah

1765
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,000
thanks so

1766
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,079
this is of concern right and it was a

1767
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:04,079
joint topic um we had a recently had a

1768
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,480
little workshop with the iab and the llc

1769
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,319
board where this was what one of the

1770
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:09,520
sessions right

1771
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:10,559
um

1772
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,440
we we are monitoring sort of

1773
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,039
the sort of activity of the itf and

1774
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,680
um we reported on it i think at the last

1775
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,480
meeting a little bit more detail um

1776
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,400
we do see that sort of currently

1777
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,319
chartered work is sort of progressing

1778
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:28,319
okay i want to say there is a like i

1779
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:30,319
think i remember like a 10

1780
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,319
reduction if you look at emails being

1781
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,760
sent for example

1782
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,440
but it's it's not sort of what i would

1783
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,680
call dramatic um but we do see a

1784
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,079
distinct drop in the submission of zero

1785
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,079
zero drafts and i think that translates

1786
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:46,240
into um you know a reduction in in buff

1787
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,440
proposals

1788
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,119
um i think everybody is sort of finding

1789
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:51,200
it difficult to socialize a topic

1790
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,880
especially something that's maybe a bit

1791
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,440
controversial or you know requires some

1792
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,280
some more shaping

1793
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,760
in this virtual format and we know also

1794
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,440
sort of anecdotally from a few people

1795
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,359
that basically are waiting with their

1796
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,280
proposals until they get to be back in

1797
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,039
person and can present to a room rather

1798
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,319
than online

1799
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,920
um

1800
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,839
so yes we are we are sort of

1801
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:14,000
hoping that we can go back to at least a

1802
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,599
hybrid format and we're going to hope

1803
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:17,440
that that'll sort of maybe revitalize

1804
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,440
the intake of new work

1805
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,119
but yeah i think the isgn leadership

1806
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:23,280
overall will sort of

1807
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,839
see that concern that you raise down

1808
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:27,839
is there any way that you can add some

1809
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:30,480
transparency to

1810
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,200
so

1811
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,480
your observation that you think that

1812
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,079
there are there are topics that might be

1813
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:35,520
considered too controversial to

1814
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,960
socialize

1815
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:37,839
now

1816
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:40,160
was something that i hadn't heard

1817
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,599
and i'm wondering

1818
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,200
is there a way to sort of share some

1819
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,200
visibility if those things are out there

1820
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,480
um

1821
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,920
you know

1822
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,039
i mean

1823
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:51,760
maybe that's not an accurate assessment

1824
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,240
um maybe it is but still i i think that

1825
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,839
from a from an organizational point of

1826
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:57,200
view it would be reassuring to know

1827
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,640
there this is

1828
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,480
that this is a uh

1829
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,079
a temporary

1830
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:05,520
you know uh a pandemic related uh change

1831
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,200
as opposed to um you know that

1832
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,119
you know the itf's uh utility may be

1833
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:12,720
diminishing

1834
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,839
so so uh i agree so all signs that we

1835
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:18,399
see point to this being solely based on

1836
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:19,679
on the

1837
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,640
pandemic and not being able to meet and

1838
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,479
so one thing that i um i'm actually

1839
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,238
happy about is hot rfc so thank you

1840
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:27,839
again for that uh because i think that

1841
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:30,319
is actually a pretty useful um vessel in

1842
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,158
which people can bring sort of at least

1843
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:34,000
the nugget of an idea for new work and

1844
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,238
expose it and get some private feedback

1845
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:37,839
and maybe that private feedback can be

1846
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:39,520
you know you should really bring this as

1847
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,479
a buff

1848
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:42,080
um right which we we haven't had that

1849
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,600
for a while and so i think people might

1850
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,520
might have been hesitant to jump

1851
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,439
straight to the buff stage which often

1852
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:49,359
times is a little bit difficult

1853
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:52,158
we also mean we have site meetings also

1854
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:54,799
um in this virtual format but i think i

1855
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:56,319
don't have numbers but it feels like

1856
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,399
there's fewer of those as well because

1857
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:00,880
maybe also the site meeting uh crowd

1858
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,560
doesn't get what they want out of the

1859
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,719
other virtual meetings which i can sort

1860
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:07,040
of understand

1861
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,719
but i sort of

1862
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:10,158
i wish i had a better answer than sort

1863
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:11,600
of hoping to be back in person but i

1864
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,040
think this is really sort of special

1865
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,799
sort of new work seems to be something

1866
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:16,319
where people really want to sit together

1867
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,960
and chat and brainstorm

1868
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,799
which doesn't lend itself well to

1869
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:23,198
performance so i i don't want to believe

1870
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:25,120
the equipment let me just make i i feel

1871
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,439
like we're uh we're completing two

1872
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:30,399
slightly different topics one is um sort

1873
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,799
of um

1874
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,719
i'm suggesting that when you say

1875
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,399
something like uh all signs are pointing

1876
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:38,158
to the fact that this is temporary i'm

1877
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:40,399
suggesting that it would be helpful if

1878
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,238
those signs could be collected together

1879
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:43,679
and shared with the community so that we

1880
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,920
can all develop that assessment that

1881
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,920
what the actual signs are are you know

1882
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,158
that then those the specifics i think

1883
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:52,000
are you know they are what they are but

1884
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
i'm just saying that uh you know you or

1885
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,320
maybe the isg are in a position where

1886
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,480
you're seeing sort of more potential

1887
01:09:58,480 --> 01:09:59,840
stuff than the rest of the community and

1888
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:00,960
i think if there's a way that you can

1889
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,040
share that um that that would be helpful

1890
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:05,920
so

1891
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,239
maybe let me say one thing i think um

1892
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:09,840
and this is a topic we've been

1893
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,440
discussing very often before and during

1894
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,800
the pandemic i think we do have

1895
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,440
generally a problem to onboard new work

1896
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,840
in a good way to find the right contact

1897
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,199
person and to bring people to the right

1898
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,280
stage right so it's not like i think the

1899
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,440
isg is actually exposed to much more of

1900
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,440
this these ideas and new work what we're

1901
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,679
also seeing is that and we're all seeing

1902
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:29,120
that that there are components of an

1903
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,560
in-person meeting that we can't um

1904
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,560
replicate in a virtual environment and

1905
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,480
these are simply missing and a lot of

1906
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,560
this was was where you actually talk to

1907
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,480
people about new work and so on and we

1908
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,920
can't replicate this and we don't just

1909
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,120
don't have it

1910
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,719
right and

1911
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,000
i think what the signs that we are

1912
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,440
looking at is just the numbers that

1913
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,719
everybody can look up from the data

1914
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:49,600
tracker or the email is like we see less

1915
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,840
emails we see less zero zero drafts and

1916
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,440
these kind of things so that's that's

1917
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,040
very good hints but it's also not a full

1918
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:59,280
evidence what's happening there

1919
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:02,960
yeah i get it okay thank you

1920
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,880
uh spencer's in the queue um sorry i

1921
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,880
also want to go ahead if you if you feel

1922
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,239
like you want an answer from the isg

1923
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:13,040
maybe bring it up again during the the

1924
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,800
later plenary when the isgs on stage

1925
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,719
because this is probably more topic well

1926
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:18,320
as much a topic for the isu than for the

1927
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,639
iap

1928
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,199
i definitely agree i think like a lot of

1929
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:25,280
people contact 80s first so they might

1930
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,760
be exposed differently than and the ib

1931
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,520
is just trying to help later and we're

1932
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,360
we're trying to improve that process so

1933
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:34,400
now we go to spencer

1934
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:39,199
yeah uh thank you uh i

1935
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,199
i may be talking to the

1936
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:45,360
okay so two two questions um

1937
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,440
the

1938
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,040
the comment about uh work being

1939
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,679
considered to be controversial uh do you

1940
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:53,679
have were you actually saying that that

1941
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:54,880
was the

1942
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,960
people proposing the work were concerned

1943
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,880
that it was too controversial or someone

1944
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,239
else was concerned that was too

1945
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:02,800
controversial i didn't understand the

1946
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,679
response to aaron

1947
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:07,840
yeah sorry maybe i sort of spoke a

1948
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,600
little bit sloppily here uh

1949
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,880
controversial might be the wrong word

1950
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,320
but what i've heard from several people

1951
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,840
is that they feel that they're

1952
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,080
that they need to have a discussion at a

1953
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,840
at a depth and at a level that they

1954
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,840
don't feel they can have in a virtual

1955
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,840
form

1956
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,320
maybe complex would be a better word

1957
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,199
than controversial oh okay

1958
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:30,080
yeah

1959
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,960
uh that's helpful and i'll uh

1960
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,920
i'll follow up during the iesg uh open

1961
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:38,000
mic so uh

1962
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,520
with it with anything with any other

1963
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,360
clever thoughts that i had thank you

1964
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,759
thank you

1965
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,480
okay thanks spencer

1966
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:47,440
um

1967
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,480
then we're moving on to sanji

1968
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,880
had a quick question i got quite

1969
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,040
confused with the work on the shmu group

1970
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,719
and the hybrid

1971
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:01,199
and all so it's vancouver planned to be

1972
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:03,679
hybrid as of now i mean i realize things

1973
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:06,159
could change

1974
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:08,000
since we are mentioning vancouver i

1975
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,080
assume there will be some in-person

1976
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,159
meetings there

1977
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:14,080
i think you have to join the queue at

1978
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,600
the next open mic again that's the

1979
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,360
question for the lhc

1980
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,440
sorry but you can you can probably take

1981
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,560
this question or we can take this

1982
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,840
question at the very beginning of their

1983
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,640
open mic session

1984
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,679
um yeah you are in the queue but you're

1985
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:29,360
on the iab so i'm not sure if you want

1986
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,199
to ask a question or yeah thank you

1987
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:33,440
thank you thanks

1988
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,360
yeah i wanted to return to the previous

1989
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,280
discussion just a little bit and so the

1990
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,280
initial question was are we concerned

1991
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,120
about the bots and i think

1992
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,280
we are but i think there are or at least

1993
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,760
in my opinion there are two factors here

1994
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,320
one is the pandemic which

1995
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,239
sort of easy to understand but i think

1996
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:52,640
there's a longer term issue that it's

1997
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,040
not easy to bring new work to the ietf

1998
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,080
and we've been discussing this of course

1999
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,640
many times but we make it relatively

2000
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:01,679
hard and

2001
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:03,440
some of the things that are making it

2002
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,800
easier is you know what rfc laws already

2003
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,199
mentioned that uh but also

2004
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:11,040
that the hackathon like if you compare

2005
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,560
the

2006
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,560
experience of bringing a new thing to

2007
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,400
the hackathon versus bringing a new

2008
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,960
thing to ietf it's quite different like

2009
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:21,199
go to the hackathon yeah you're welcome

2010
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:22,880
and you know have your team have your

2011
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,000
table

2012
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,600
and and you just

2013
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,239
uh move forward um it's much harder in

2014
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:30,719
the itf side and of course i understand

2015
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:32,480
some of the reasons why and i understand

2016
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,760
that

2017
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,080
many proposals are also all over the

2018
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,239
place and not very easy to add up to any

2019
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:40,400
standards organization

2020
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,280
but

2021
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,800
i i think we should at least recognize

2022
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,560
that this is an issue it's it's

2023
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,640
difficult in the idea to do these new

2024
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,880
things

2025
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,159
yeah i just

2026
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:52,159
want to add you say we're making it hard

2027
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:53,440
i don't think we're making it hard on

2028
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,199
purpose it is hard to bring your work

2029
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,800
you have to understand a lot about the

2030
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,880
itf and we're not doing enough to

2031
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,640
helping people with that and that's

2032
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,480
definitely a job for the iab

2033
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,960
and that's what we what we do discuss at

2034
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,280
the iab but it's also not easy to find

2035
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,840
the right ways for

2036
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,600
that so like if people have more input

2037
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,440
please let us know and start a

2038
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,400
discussion with the iab

2039
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,600
okay um the queue is empty now and as we

2040
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,600
already had the first question for the

2041
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,360
lac i just handed over to jason

2042
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,960
thanks and jay maybe do you want to

2043
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,360
speak initially to the uh vancouver

2044
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,560
question

2045
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,040
yep um so

2046
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,120
just double checking when vancouver is

2047
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:52,040
but it's a little while off um

2048
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,640
vancouver is 2024. um

2049
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,600
so

2050
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,880
uh

2051
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,280
yes i imagine that will probably still

2052
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,440
be some form of hybrid meeting but i

2053
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:06,800
can't really guess any more beyond that

2054
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,760
being almost three years away

2055
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,199
if you have a more specific question

2056
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:12,960
i'll try and answer it but that's best i

2057
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:16,000
can do i think at the moment

2058
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,440
my apologies i

2059
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,280
misremembered

2060
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,840
the slide who will the next itf which is

2061
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,199
placed to be in a city

2062
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:28,400
is it

2063
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,360
will it be in person since the hotel and

2064
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,600
all has been booked

2065
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,840
so the next um

2066
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,800
planned itf meeting itf113

2067
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,360
is we are looking to

2068
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,440
book we're currently in negotiations

2069
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,239
with a venue in europe and hoping to

2070
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:48,800
book and that's the one that i'm as i

2071
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,159
mentioned earlier

2072
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:54,560
we are um expecting or planning for a

2073
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,880
smaller number of on-site participants

2074
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,800
about 650

2075
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,640
um down from what would be otherwise

2076
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,239
about eleven 1100

2077
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:05,280
and so yes that would inevitably be a

2078
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,719
hybrid meeting

2079
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:09,360
i think it's fair to guess that the we

2080
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,040
will have hybrid meetings for the next

2081
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,800
couple of years at least

2082
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,600
um

2083
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,040
given the uh the ongoing nature of

2084
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:21,640
pandemics and the way that diseases work

2085
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,920
you jason

2086
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:35,040
yeah other questions

2087
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:45,280
uh looks like dominique

2088
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:48,159
yeah hi um i just wanted to follow up on

2089
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,159
the community survey i think that was

2090
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:51,760
mentioned um

2091
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,520
and i note that it's both the llc and um

2092
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,000
esg i think both that are covering it i

2093
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,679
just wanted to see if you had any more

2094
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,840
follow-up on it um in terms of the

2095
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:03,600
actions from it i know that you have a

2096
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,199
whole year that you're going to review

2097
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:07,120
it but any any information would be

2098
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,760
great thanks

2099
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:13,839
do you want me to pick this up jason

2100
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:16,400
yes please i'm gonna quickly join i'm

2101
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,719
getting an echo outside of here

2102
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:21,120
sure um the the

2103
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,440
just the the other week we had a joint

2104
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:27,520
um iesg llc iab workshop

2105
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,600
spread over four days and one of those

2106
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,400
sessions focused on the community survey

2107
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,040
and the output to the community survey

2108
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:38,080
and the major issues as

2109
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,960
reported through that survey

2110
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,600
so um there i

2111
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,360
won't go into the details of what was

2112
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,280
discussed um because that hasn't yet

2113
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:50,880
been written up and agreed properly yet

2114
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,560
but it certainly was um there was an

2115
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,320
understanding that some things there are

2116
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,239
important that need to be tackled by all

2117
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:01,520
of us and um considerable effort was put

2118
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,199
into thinking about how we might tackle

2119
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:04,800
those so i think that's probably all we

2120
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,239
can say unless lars wants to add

2121
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:09,839
anything to that

2122
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:23,480
i can assume no then so

2123
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,040
should we go with spencer i think you're

2124
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:34,440
next in the queue

2125
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:39,440
yeah i uh i just wanted to take a a

2126
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,480
moment to uh thank you all

2127
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,280
on camera and live for the work that you

2128
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,480
all are doing

2129
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,840
uh i've been

2130
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:48,960
following

2131
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,440
at a distance you know the work that you

2132
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,800
all have been doing

2133
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,679
in the current environment and uh

2134
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:58,320
this is this is the uh

2135
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,080
i think this is the itf meeting where i

2136
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,480
finally realized there's no possible way

2137
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,560
i could i could even contribute to this

2138
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,239
so

2139
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:07,760
thank you for the work you're doing i

2140
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,920
know it is not easy and

2141
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:13,120
i know it really matters

2142
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:17,080
thank you

2143
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,920

open mic

2156
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,320
session about

2157
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,880
new work and things like that uh i think

2158
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,560
one of the things that's important to uh

2159
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:23,120
to to say is that um

2160
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,600
we have to you know

2161
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,880
we have tools now that we that so i'm

2162
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,400
not talking i'm not talking to you guys

2163
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,159
i'm talking to you guys and the

2164
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:36,239
community uh

2165
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:38,400
we have tools that

2166
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,480
uh now that we could use more

2167
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,560
so the hot rfc thing was kind of shut

2168
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,960
down during the uh

2169
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,120
pandemic and it took us a while to

2170
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,400
figure out that

2171
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,199
uh we could actually do that uh in a

2172
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:57,280
virtual meeting or in a hybrid meeting

2173
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,679
but that and you know we've had uh the

2174
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:02,080
publication of

2175
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,639
public side meetings

2176
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:08,560
in the wiki for a while as well

2177
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:12,000
one of the things that i note uh is that

2178
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,239
uh

2179
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:15,360
gather is

2180
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,800
and i didn't realize this for a while

2181
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,080
but gather is up between itf meetings

2182
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,920
so you know anything that you could do

2183
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,639
and gather you know today or in the in

2184
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:27,360
the coming week you could do in

2185
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,080
february also

2186
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:33,280
and that that that does actually have uh

2187
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,280
the ability to

2188
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,280
have audio visual

2189
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:40,320
conversations and things like that

2190
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,400
that i think would would be very helpful

2191
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,840
for people you know one of the things

2192
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,320
we've done with side meetings so far

2193
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:49,120
which is fine is uh leaving people to

2194
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,840
find their own conferencing facilities

2195
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:56,320
but if if gather is uh is capable of uh

2196
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,560
supporting you know the small

2197
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,000
the small meetings that we kind of

2198
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,560
visualize assigned meetings that may be

2199
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,120
a that may be a a good thing as well you

2200
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,719
know it's it it's that i think it's

2201
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:08,239
important for

2202
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:10,159
everyone especially the community to

2203
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:12,400
remember that bots have never been a

2204
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,960
required part of this they were just a

2205
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,280
convenient way of us of us

2206
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,800
evaluating new work proposals when the

2207
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:23,120
community gathered you know with much of

2208
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,360
the community gathered uh three times a

2209
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:26,960
year

2210
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,520
but there's nothing magic about boss the

2211
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:32,239
the thing is basically to focus on

2212
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:35,520
quality new work proposals coming in and

2213
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,199
being able to move those forward at the

2214
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:38,639
itf

2215
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:39,920
um

2216
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,719
you know i'm curious if you all have uh

2217
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:45,840
uh reactions to that but uh

2218
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:46,840
i'll

2219
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,400
uh

2220
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:52,000
i'll uh hang up and take my uh

2221
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,360
take my answers on the air

2222
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,718
thanks spencer

2223
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,960
yes but i wanted to say uh i i think the

2224
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,520
idea of having a high quality idea

2225
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,679
not going through a formal buff to

2226
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:11,520
directly kind of chartering is a very

2227
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,760
viable kind of path that is one of the

2228
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,360
outcomes that's sometimes recommended at

2229
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,760
a sec dispatch that the idea seems baked

2230
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,520
enough there's enough kind of discussion

2231
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,199
on it let's let's do a little more

2232
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:22,639
mailing list discussion to get charter

2233
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:25,440
language firmed up

2234
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:30,159
thanks roman so one thing i want to pick

2235
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:32,480
up that spencer said is sort of i'd be

2236
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,560
curious to know if if one reason why

2237
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,960
people find it difficult to uh progress

2238
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,440
work is is the lack of sort of tools

2239
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,480
like uh gather i think so given that

2240
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,800
sort of hangouts and other sort of free

2241
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,199
collaboration systems are available if

2242
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:48,719
that's the case we can certainly try and

2243
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:51,280
invest there from the tools side um if

2244
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,280
this is really sort of an issue for many

2245
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,080
people

2246
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:57,280
um if so maybe send email to isg or get

2247
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,840
into the queue now

2248
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,719
i think i still have spencer in the

2249
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:05,520
queue

2250
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,199
go to him first and then i see wes

2251
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,199
that was me actually leaving the queue

2252
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:12,719
and then popping back in in front of

2253
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:15,840
west uh my apologies west

2254
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,920
the so i wanted to uh

2255
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:20,480
really uh thank you for the for the uh

2256
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:23,440
for the comment about uh sec dispatch

2257
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,400
uh

2258
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,880
as a reminder to me

2259
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:30,400
almost all the areas have uh

2260
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,280
some form of dispatchy

2261
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:36,560
uh function these days don't they and i

2262
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:40,480
wonder whether i wonder whether

2263
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,080
being able to

2264
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:45,360
do something with those kinds of

2265
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,840
groups where they're you know where it's

2266
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:50,320
more formal than

2267
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,400
a side meeting together but less formal

2268
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,120
than a buff request uh being able to do

2269
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:57,840
that on an ongoing you know like

2270
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,239
once between ietf meetings say as an

2271
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:01,360
example

2272
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,440
uh just so that people aren't waiting

2273
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:04,960
four months to

2274
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,199
have you know see how things go with the

2275
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:08,480
ietf

2276
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:09,760
uh

2277
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,679
the you know the thing that jason

2278
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:13,600
that uh jason was talking about with the

2279
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,199
llc of

2280
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:16,080
you know

2281
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,080
looking at stuff more frequently that we

2282
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,480
have been looking at things i think that

2283
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:21,760
you know i think that may be a good

2284
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,639
model for the technical work as well

2285
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:28,480
as you know to say uh what

2286
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:30,400
what are we gonna what are we gonna wish

2287
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,360
we had a good proposal you know had

2288
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:36,320
approved a proposal for at the next ietf

2289
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,280
meeting

2290
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,280
and i always say you know you guys you

2291
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,760
guys would know better how to do that on

2292
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,719
the uh with the current structure and

2293
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:47,120
uh in the current environment but uh i

2294
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,400
did i did want to respond to that uh

2295
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:53,280
as well i think i think you know

2296
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:56,480
i think you're digging in the right hole

2297
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,879
thank you

2298
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,239
lauren go ahead

2299
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:04,239
yeah thanks so i mean i think one of the

2300
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:06,239
things that things like buffs give us

2301
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,560
that dispatch type groups don't

2302
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:11,520
is it seems as though we get more cross

2303
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:14,639
area input from buffs and similar

2304
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:16,159
and one of the things i'm concerned

2305
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:18,960
about is that we don't end up in sort of

2306
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:21,840
silos of people in areas

2307
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,159
one way we could try and mitigate that

2308
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:25,199
is

2309
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:27,440
try and make it so that people are more

2310
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,520
willing from other areas to show up at

2311
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,600
the dispatch meetings

2312
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,120
possibly by scheduling things that

2313
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,560
there's less conflict so that with

2314
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,960
dispatches or just trying to have more

2315
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,880
of a culture of dispatch meetings

2316
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:43,440
are more open and accessible to people

2317
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:44,960
from other areas

2318
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,480
i'm really concerned we end up with

2319
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,639
silos of

2320
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:51,120
apps working on apps ops working on ops

2321
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,639
routing only are not routing and we

2322
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:53,840
don't get the

2323
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,719
the white cross area

2324
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:02,480
review yeah um one quick um point to

2325
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:05,199
that is we actually sort of discussed um

2326
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:07,679
briefly yesterday actually and also a

2327
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:09,280
few weeks ago the idea of whether we

2328
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,360
should have like a dispatch dispatch or

2329
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,280
or just dispatch meaning where basically

2330
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,679
it's something i call ifc but with

2331
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:18,400
discussion uh and an itfy where you can

2332
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,600
basically have a first stop for new work

2333
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,400
and and where it gets triaged

2334
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,880
um maybe into areas or maybe just in

2335
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,800
some other directions and that by by its

2336
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:31,040
nature would be done because area so

2337
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,480
that that could be sort of a thing to

2338
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,000
try out but i want to go to west has

2339
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,440
been patiently waiting in the queue

2340
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:38,839
let's go ahead

2341
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,600
so first off apparently warren says we

2342
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,120
should be wearing hats so i thought i'd

2343
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,360
join in but i wanted to follow spencer's

2344
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,920
topic a little bit um because it's an

2345
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,239
important one and you know

2346
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:55,040
it's definitely easier to have new work

2347
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,880
when you can get together and

2348
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,639
do it in person

2349
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:01,440
but we're not going back to fully online

2350
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,520
or fully in person for a while i mean if

2351
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,120
we're we just heard earlier that you

2352
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,880
know we expect march to be sort of half

2353
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,440
attended and so hybrid meetings you know

2354
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,520
may still mean less incoming work unless

2355
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,440
we can you know find other solutions

2356
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,600
that you know allow us to continue

2357
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,600
bringing in new work even when

2358
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,440
some of the potential participants can't

2359
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,960
actually make it to the meeting because

2360
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,360
they're in an area where travel may be

2361
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,280
restricted for example

2362
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,520
um so it would really benefit everyone

2363
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,199
to concentrate on reaching out and

2364
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:30,719
helping you know through some of the

2365
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:32,960
existing tools i'm very happy that uh

2366
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,480
spencer you know

2367
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,480
mentioned gather for example as being

2368
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,120
around in between meetings um i will

2369
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,800
admit myself i haven't joined gather as

2370
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,280
much as i as i should and i should i

2371
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,800
intend to make a concentrated effort to

2372
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,239
do that but

2373
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:48,000
just you know even responding to email

2374
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:48,960
or

2375
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,400
helping out with the guides program or

2376
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:51,840
something like that you know would

2377
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,080
greatly help bring in new work it feels

2378
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,480
really good when you actually manage to

2379
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,719
you know help somebody take a document

2380
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:00,960
walk them through the ietf process and

2381
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,120
then later find you know that that new

2382
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,639
member that brought in new work to

2383
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:06,880
become a active member of the ietf

2384
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:08,320
community and there's been a couple of

2385
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,400
cases over the past i wanna say five to

2386
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,679
ten years where i've helped somebody

2387
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:13,679
come in and you know now they're now

2388
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:14,880
they're actually writing more mail than

2389
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,320
i can because i

2390
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,159
really am not great at keeping up with

2391
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:21,040
email but um so you know final point is

2392
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,880
really try and make a concentrated

2393
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:25,040
effort to help you know help newcomers

2394
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,520
come in and help them because it will

2395
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,360
just whittle away if

2396
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,840
and and wither if they don't get help

2397
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,840
through the the weird processes the ietf

2398
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,440
i'd argue every standards organization

2399
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,520
has the same issue not just the atf

2400
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,840
thanks

2401
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,920
thanks yeah that was a good point so i

2402
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:43,440
actually got matched up with somebody

2403
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,520
through mentoring that was trying to

2404
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:46,840
bring new work i think it was to

2405
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,120
transport and and that was i think a

2406
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,800
pretty interesting engagement for both

2407
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,080
sides in terms of you know you can

2408
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,920
really sort of help somebody explain you

2409
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,280
know what should you focus on when you

2410
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,280
first present this what are some of the

2411
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:58,719
questions you're likely going to get and

2412
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:01,440
so on and i'm i'm wondering so also

2413
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,360
think about emoji and the mentoring

2414
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,120
effort whether this is something we can

2415
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,639
maybe strengthen right whether we

2416
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:08,880
actually don't only focus on new

2417
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,199
participants that focus on new work that

2418
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:12,800
might come from existing participants

2419
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,639
but uh that it might be work that they

2420
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:17,280
don't quite know how to bring

2421
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,480
could also be something for further

2422
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,959
discussion

2423
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:24,080
i see an empty queue at the moment

2424
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,840
does that mean we are

2425
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,280
ending

2426
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:31,320
almost on top of the hour

2427
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:37,440
aaron go ahead

2428
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:46,159
yeah uh so uh before we break um uh

2429
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:47,920
the the sort of the general the comment

2430
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:50,080
to everybody capabilities and gather are

2431
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,840
a little bit limited and so i want to

2432
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,679
take a minute and just sort of talk

2433
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:56,080
about the hot rfc structure if that's

2434
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,159
okay with you

2435
01:31:58,159 --> 01:31:59,280
okay

2436
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:02,719
so uh so we have a space and gather um

2437
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:07,199
for hot rfc um the the links on the um

2438
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:09,280
on the agenda page

2439
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:12,400
uh and um notewell is the password to

2440
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,280
get in

2441
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,840
um if you go in there you'll see where

2442
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:16,960
you enter

2443
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,239
and after you decorate your avatar um

2444
01:32:20,239 --> 01:32:22,800
there's directions uh

2445
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,719
on the floor to take you to the hot rc

2446
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:26,719
space it's laid out like a poster

2447
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:30,080
session uh and so each talk has a little

2448
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,000
essentially a private room and gather

2449
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,679
where uh

2450
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:36,000
folks who are in the room can talk to

2451
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,080
each other but you don't hear people in

2452
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,760
outside the room or

2453
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,880
and uh or here at the video uh there's a

2454
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,600
youtube video for each talk where um you

2455
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,280
can asynchronously watch the talk if you

2456
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,199
haven't seen it already and there's a

2457
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:52,000
whiteboard for uh you know leaving

2458
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,480
messages to other interested folks and

2459
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,800
um or you know having a real-time

2460
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:57,840
discussion

2461
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,840
and i've invited each of the presenters

2462
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,880
to be present in their uh their little

2463
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:06,159
uh poster room uh for folks who want to

2464
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:07,199
discuss

2465
01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:08,639
their proposal

2466
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:10,480
so um

2467
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:13,199
we've got an hour nominally starts at

2468
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:15,199
quarter after the hour in about 12

2469
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:17,840
minutes um and

2470
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,679
you can wander around and talk to folks

2471
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:21,440
this this is co-scheduled with the

2472
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:22,719
reception so you don't have to go there

2473
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:25,440
you can go to the reception and uh

2474
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:29,199
and talk to anybody you want uh and um

2475
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:30,639
uh

2476
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:32,800
we do have the space for

2477
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,840
the entire day and so if folks want to

2478
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,679
run long for any reason that's totally

2479
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:39,440
fine you're not going to get kicked out

2480
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:42,960
uh and i will be there you uh if anybody

2481
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,760
has any questions on how to interact um

2482
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,600
and the secretary is also around and

2483
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,679
they're helping people as well so i

2484
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:50,480
think

2485
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:51,920
that is

2486
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:53,600
everything i wanted to get out there so

2487
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,639
hope you all show up and can make it and

2488
01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:59,360
yeah enjoy it and give me feedback if

2489
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:01,280
things that you liked or didn't like

2490
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:02,800
so that we can figure out whether this

2491
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,080
is something we want to continue next

2492
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:06,239
time

2493
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,280
thanks aaron that was useful um and yeah

2494
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,120
thank you all for joining the plenary um

2495
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:12,560
i know it was early for some of you but

2496
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:15,679
i think we had pretty good attendance um

2497
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:16,880
probably under the same order of

2498
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,639
magnitude as the last few that we've

2499
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:20,159
done so that that's a good sign for this

2500
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:21,360
experiment

2501
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:23,600
and i'll see you all over and gather now

2502
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,360
and then next week in the working group

2503
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:30,280
sessions enjoy the itf bye guys

2504
