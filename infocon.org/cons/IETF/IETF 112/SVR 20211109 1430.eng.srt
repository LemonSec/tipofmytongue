1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,360
okay we are on top of the hour

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,840
i see we have

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,600
at least the first speaker here we have

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,199
our error director here so i think we

5
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,000
can start we only have 60 minutes

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,920
so we better get started you know and

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,599
not lose too much of everybody's

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,640
valuable time here so welcome to link

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,200
state vector routing working group so we

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,680
didn't meet at the previous itf meeting

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,879
but we decided to to meet right now

12
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,600
as everybody has noticed the working

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,040
group itself

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,120
the email list has not been you know the

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,520
most active one so

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,360
i think you can count most of the emails

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,800
of you know of each month on a single

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,559
hand which is a little bit you know

19
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,079
unfortunate

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,440
anyway

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,399
so

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,680
here we are so

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,719
uh

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,000
we don't really need the javascript

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,680
because we have

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,959
our

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,000
uh

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,240
texting tool within the mig tool so

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,760
which is directly attached which is very

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,320
nice for minutes as i mentioned it would

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,320
be very appreciated if people you know

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,320
who actually are attending here

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,080
to t you know to help taking minutes

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,600
here if we make this a collaborative

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,439
effort it will make it easier for you

36
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,040
know for for everybody and for the

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,000
chairs

38

to

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,520
collect the minions at the end and you

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,840
know we'll reduce the burden for a

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,079
single person to take notes

42
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,280
uh before we go on let's also have uh be

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,119
aware of the note well by now you should

44
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,040
have seen it already a few times

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,360
no really you know be aware of it

46
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,200
anything you say

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,119
you know here at uh at the online

48
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,640
event

49
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,320
we'll be seeing another contribution

50
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,479
towards ietf be aware of that

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,079
so for the agenda

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,719
as i mentioned we have 16 minutes today

53
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,640
we have

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,200
four different topics

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,160
uh we first gonna be covering

56
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,959
uh

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,760
like quick agenda bashing as one word

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,280
speak about some of the drafts we have

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,879
in the working group itself

60
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,599
then we're gonna have a short update on

61
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,400
the

62
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,160
bgp spf technology and to understand the

63
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,520
state we are in at this point in time

64
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,599
where the draft is

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,400
then

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,239
a new drought is going to be introduced

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,959
about bgp spf floating reduction

68
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,519
followed with the ieee update on lltpv2

69
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,879
and to understand where we are

70
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,480
where the technology actually is i know

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,800
at this point in time as i understood

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
it's actually almost ready for

73
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,599
for for release which is a good thing

74
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,400
and

75
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,920
then at

76
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,680
the last topic here we're going to

77
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,000
discuss a little bit on what are going

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,760
to be the next steps you know for the

79
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,680
working group itself once we have

80
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,400
delivered the bgp link state short spot

81
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,800
routing document

82
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,159
towards the iesg

83
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,159
any suggestions or comments about

84
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,640
the plant agenda here

85
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,839
it should be no surprises

86
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,560
okay perfect

87
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,760
so

88
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,680
if you look into where we are with our

89
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,879
documents here so we had two documents

90
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,120
which went to working group lost call

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,360
the ad reviewed them and they sent them

92
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,879
back to the working group for updates

93
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,760
the bhp spf one has been updated based

94
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,599
upon the feedbacks here we are now at

95
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,840
release

96
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,640
15.

97
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,319
and those updates are going to be

98
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,680
discussed by kyour there were also some

99
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,200
the other draft the

100
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,080
lsvr applicability release 7 was

101
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,560
reviewed by our area director there was

102
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,040
like a whole list of review comments

103
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
that came out of that

104
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,239
uh the

105
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,480
applicability

106
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,400
is everyone seeing the slides i i just

107
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,080
got to note that some people may not be

108
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,840
seeing slides right now

109
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,640

112
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
yeah i can see them but apparently some

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,600
of the working group members don't see

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,199
them

115
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,199
oh

116
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,600
that is for everybody or just a few

117
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,680
people

118
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,440
let's ask paul here from the queue

119
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,759
oops

120
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,919

121
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,840
echo pre-shared uh

122
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,440
tool

123
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,479
so let's ask uh ac

124
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,240

125
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,479
oh man i think i'm rejecting you see do

126
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,840

127
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,040
didn't

128
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,800
i tried to get you to speak there

129
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,240
um

130
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,960
one second here

131
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,600
i'll see you in the shut up

132
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,800
now they can see now it looks like

133
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,479
there's a delay they can see them now

134
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,800
there's probably a delay so please

135
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,240
continue

136
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,479
okay

137
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,360
yeah i don't know when the slide

138
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
actually started to appear

139
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,680
for the audience here

140
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,080
but coming back to this slide so i hope

141
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
you're seeing slide 5 here at this point

142
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,560
in time

143
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,199
so the bgp spf

144
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,240
draft 13 which was released

145
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,960
in the beginning of the year

146
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,639
uh

147
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,639
has been further updated to release 15

148
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,240
where we are right now

149
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,600
also the

150
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,120
uh routing area directorate reviewed the

151
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,160
earlier versions and the feedback of

152
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,600
that review got into version 14 which

153
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,919
was you know now updated to release 15

154
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,520
also which is going to be discussed by

155
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,479
cure

156
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,639
the applicability draft

157
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,360
so the version 7 was

158
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,160
reviewed by our area director he had

159
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,440
like a long list of updates on that one

160
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,319
those updates were i think processed uh

161
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,960
by the authors of this draft and release

162
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,360
eight actually came out of that as a

163
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,720
result

164
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
now i did a diff between seven and eight

165
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,160
and

166
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,600
it seems to be

167
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,319
you know inconsistent

168
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,039
with the big number of comments from our

169
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,560
era director and the updates to the

170
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,240
draft so i'm not really sure you know

171
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,000
what actually you know what exactly

172
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
happened there you know on the

173
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,840
progressing but i'm pretty sure you know

174
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,080
that the authors will you know give a

175
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,880
given update that one also

176
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,400
so the plan is

177
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,479
once we are finished with the bgp spf

178
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,400
and the applicability that they will be

179
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,000
submitted at the same time towards iesg

180
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,800
for further processing

181
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,599
now then we also have our

182
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,800
l3dl drafts which has been progressed

183
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,199
they have been all been refreshed

184
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,520
on the 14th of

185
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,639
october which is very good

186
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,599
these drafts are now a little bit in a

187
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,440
pending state because

188
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,240
it would be very good you know to

189
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,000
you know to keep working on them

190
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,560
but we can only progress them further

191
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
after we have you know fully confirmed

192
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,639
with our recharge ring to actually keep

193
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,240
them into the you know to bring them

194
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,000
into the charter of our working group

195
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,880
here

196
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,120
mainly because there is a similar-ish

197
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,520
you know technology at ieee

198
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,160
and you know to avoid procedural issues

199
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,319
and problematics you know it would be

200
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,120
you know

201
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,759
very beneficial for us to have these

202
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,400
explicitly mentioned in our charter

203
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,720
as a working group item itself you know

204
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,240
to make things easier

205
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,360
so let me see where we are now

206
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,039
okay so that's the ieee status

207
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:03,840
so

208
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,080
any any further questions before we or

209
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,919
some comments you know before we go into

210
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,160
the first session from

211
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,400
k or

212
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,319
okay

213
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,240
so let me try to share the you don't see

214
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,800
anyone in the notepad uh i'm i'm taking

215
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,400
notes for now okay okay okay

216
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,320
so i'm gonna go to the next section

217
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,320
voila

218
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,519
so

219
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,920
is it uh popping up here for you the

220
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,120
screen yes

221
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,200
yes and are you going to flip the slice

222
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,959
for me if you cannot click the

223
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,480
slideshows if you don't have the

224
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,080
authority to click the slides i will

225
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,160
click the slides for you

226
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,240
i don't think you have

227
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,360
no i don't

228
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,680
okay just tell me what you want me to do

229
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,719
super thank you

230
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,279
hi folks my name is keir patel and i'm

231
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,480
going to give an update on bgp spf

232
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,880
since the last

233
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,120
working group session we've had

234
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,800
here at itf next slide please

235
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,040
so the version 15 of the draft is out i

236
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,240
think we posted was version 15

237
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,839
in july

238
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:28,959
in here

239
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,040
we have made text consistent

240
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,760
when it comes to the usage of bgp

241
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,480
speakers we now call them as bgp spf

242
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,120
speakers as a terminology a minor net

243
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,760
but we have made it consistent across

244
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,040
the draft

245
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,120
we've also provided a clarification on

246
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,279
spf backing

247
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,160
update message

248
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,160
for the nlris um chances are very high

249
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,640
that because bgp

250
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,200
attributes are going to be very

251
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
prefix specific

252
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,079
that the update may only carry in lot of

253
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,839
cases a single

254
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,600
prefix

255
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,640
should not

256
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,959
affect anything considering and knowing

257
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,279
that number of prefixes in underlay are

258
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,279
always going to be smaller but we've

259
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,480
nonetheless

260
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,079
made the clarification it doesn't

261
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,920
guarantee that the packing

262
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,160
uh will not carry more than one update

263
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,240
so the text is added

264
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,959
we've also ensured with an appropriate

265
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,079
text um clarifying that only one status

266
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,399
tlb is to be advertised in a given

267
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,560
update message knowing that the status

268
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,839
tlv is common for link attribute node

269
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,240
attribute and the prefix attribute um

270
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,000
also beefed up

271
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,959
error handling um section

272
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,839
uh with regards to the status dlv to

273
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,279
ensure um only one of the status tlb is

274
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,880
carried

275
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,720
in the uptick message next slide please

276
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,200
also in the best part um uh algorithm

277
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,320
selection which is an spf algorithm here

278
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,720
we have provided clarification of

279
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,200
handling of ecmp next talks uh although

280
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,040
this is very implementation dependent

281
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,800
but it always makes

282
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,600
sense to get to a deterministic ecmp

283
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,160
selection so the way to get there is

284
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,079
first of all the next stops

285
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,120
should be bounded to number of ecmps

286
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,240
that are configured on the router

287
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,640
once you've bounded number of next stops

288
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,079
to the number of ecmps

289
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,040
always

290
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,519
a numbered link next stop is preferred

291
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,880
over an unnumbered

292
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,720
next stop

293
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,560
and

294
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,120
when you are looking at number link um

295
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,959
highest address

296
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,040
on the number link as well as highest

297
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,360
remote identifier on the unnumbered link

298
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,079
is always preferred this will always

299
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,519
ensure um deterministic next stop um

300
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,959
selection that will be done for the

301
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,959
ecmps yeah next slide please

302
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,800
we have also provided a clarification

303
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,000
text in spf algorithm section as well

304
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,720
that says how do you

305
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,040
match a given link what are the

306
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,360
criterias for that

307
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,480
so

308
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,079
on the numbered link

309
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,440
we've said that the link descriptors

310
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,760
must have to share v4 or a v6 subnet for

311
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,839
a link to be considered as a matching

312
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,680
link on an unnumbered link

313
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,279
the current links local identifier must

314
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,320
match remote nodes link remote

315
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,200
identifier and vice versa the current

316
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,079
links

317
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,360
remote identifier must match

318
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,519
the remote node links

319
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,519
um local identifier

320
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,680
if you do that um

321
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,399
the link is considered um to be

322
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,720
matched and it's considered to be

323
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,160
found as a matching link in the database

324
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,399
also added error handling

325
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,320
text for particularly ipv4 prefix length

326
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,480
dlv where you say

327
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,279
that any length error

328
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,440
in prefix land tlv particularly for ipv4

329
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,519
must result in first the dropping of the

330
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,160
tlb um then you ensure that the

331
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,920
corresponding

332
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,839
node nlri

333
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,880
is also considered um

334
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,360
as an error and you do not advertise it

335
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,279
further you drop it

336
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,440
furthermore is ensuring also that in

337
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,480
corresponding link nlri is considered as

338
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,680
malformed

339
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,199
and must handle as a treat as

340
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,639
withdrawal

341
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,680
so

342
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,240
the link error handling text i'm sorry

343
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,600
the prefix length tlv error handling

344
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,320
text has been also beefed up

345
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,880
to make sure um that the appropriate

346
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,959
error handling is done for its

347
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,680
associated node nlri as well as the link

348
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,920
in our array and there were some minor

349
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
needs that we had fixed in the draft as

350
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,279
well

351
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,760
next slide piece

352
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,680
thank you

353
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,720
here's the

354
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,199
diff on the version 13.

355
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,079
both version 13 and version 15 came out

356
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,160
after the implementation were pretty

357
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,920
much done and they have been

358
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,000
incorporated in

359
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,839
implementation as well

360
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,240
in version 13 of course

361
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,440
we had received um 80 comments that we

362
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,480
had in incorporated we had beefed up

363
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,720
error handling to great extent security

364
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,839
section

365
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,800
um was added um

366
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,199
we clarified the interaction and

367
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,720
relationship to bgpls again and htlv's

368
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,160
compared to bgps pf safety

369
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,760
overall

370
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,519
clarification text

371
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,480
provided and of course the spf section

372
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,320
which is pretty much an implementation

373
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,920
specific section

374
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,440
was augmented

375
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,320
to provide a very detailed description

376
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,279
uh

377
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,680
of of how the best part selection should

378
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,720
go for

379
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,000
yeah next slide please

380
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,000
so after and after version 13 and after

381
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,720
version 15 the overall status summary of

382
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
the draft is as follows

383
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,120
most of the text changes that we have

384
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,440
incorporated so far um

385
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,000
has minimal impact on implementation

386
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,800
error handling is the exception where we

387
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,560
had to go in and

388
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,399
really look into implementation to make

389
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,040
sure that appropriate error ending was

390
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,160
in place

391
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,320
um in a section has also uh been updated

392
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,959
with the implementation uh based dlv

393
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,920
values that were missing earlier yeah

394
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,639
next slide please

395
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,680
at this point um we have received

396
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,440
reviews from numerous folks in the

397
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,800
working group

398
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,600
itself of course

399
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,199
we have also um had a review on the

400
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,480
routine from the routing area

401
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,160
directorate as well

402
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,639
all the issues that were um

403
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,320
raised were addressed and uh hopefully

404
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,639
the status is cleared by now

405
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,120
we've also received a detailed list of

406
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,000
comments uh from our 80 and we've

407
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,560
addressed all of them um the working

408
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,519
group

409
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,320
uh last call at this point

410
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,720
from our perspective is successfully

411
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,880
done it was done once

412
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,560
been sent again to the working group and

413
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,720
we have taken care of it

414
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,639
we request the chairs at this point that

415
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,519
we feel draft is in a very stable state

416
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,480
with an implementation um such um so

417
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,360
that

418
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,000
the chairs we do request the chairs to

419
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,600
complete the last call and progress the

420
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,480
draft um last but not least

421
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,639
we have multiple implementations on this

422
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,920
um there's one open source

423
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,520
implementation also

424
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,160
been made available on there for our

425
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,520
on in fr itself

426
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,959
next slide please

427
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,439
yep and the last work that is in place

428
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,599
this is fairly straightforward is the

429
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,079
support for young models um

430
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,439
since only support for new safi is to be

431
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,880
provided they should be a fairly

432
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,400
straightforward draft

433
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,600
that we

434
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,520
are thinking of

435
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,200
putting it out by next itf

436
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,480
and i believe that was my last slide

437
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,880
you are cool

438
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,160
okay eerie silence

439
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,039
so basically what you need for for this

440
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,120
for us for for this piece of work the

441
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
progress through our working group is

442
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,880
the iana code points i guess

443
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,919
i believe we already have them

444
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,760
oh okay i thought you actually had to

445
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,200
implement one but i'm not sure if they

446
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,480
were actually

447
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,520
uh

448
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,760
assigned on the first come first serve

449
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,160
base at this point in time

450
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,960
okay that is good

451
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,520
okay cool so we'll we'll work on closing

452
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,280
that working group last call thing then

453
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,760
and then you know push this thing uh

454
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,280
onwards

455
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,240
okay thank you

456
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,159
now let me go in

457
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,080
for the comments okay

458
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,840
you're welcome thank you

459
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,080
now we have the next section

460
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,640
hey mo you you are a lie uh your audio

461
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,760
working

462
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,559
okay super can you see the slides yes

463
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,960
can you hear me okay yes yes i can do it

464
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,280
perfectly well okay thank you go on

465
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,600
good hello everyone today i'm going to

466
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,360
talk about the bgps pf login reduction

467
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,678
next page

468
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,679
but first i i'll have an overview

469
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,559
on existing bgp spf lighting procedure

470
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,840
and then

471
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,480
revise the vlogging procedure for

472
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,240
flooding reduction

473
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,600
at the last

474
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,520
vertical extensions

475
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,240
to support this flooding reduction next

476
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,559
page

477
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,559
in existing

478
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,440
egpsf lighting procedure

479
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,640
for rr model

480
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,440
pgp speaker

481
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,720
will send

482
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,160
its link states

483
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,679
to every

484
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,760
rooted reflectors

485
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,520
after receiving these link states

486
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,799
every

487
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,400
router reflector

488
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,600
will send

489
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,840
the link states to the other

490
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,520
bgp speakers

491
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,000
for example in this in this in this

492
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,880
figure

493
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,400
node a

494
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,679
will send

495
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,280
its link space

496
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,480
to both

497
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,159
r1 and r2

498
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,919
r2 off are these two

499
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,440
router reflectors after receiving

500
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,919
the link states from node a

501
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,840
they will send

502
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,679
the same link states

503
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,480
to node b and c so in this case node b

504
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,840
and the c

505
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,360
receives

506
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,880
two copies of the same link states so

507
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,960
one is from r1 the r3 is from r2

508
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,799
so one

509
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,799
copy is redundant

510
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,840
maybe also to be reduced next page

511
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,080
so

512
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,840
in

513
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,720
existing bgps pf flooding procedure

514
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,200
in node connections mode

515
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,720
so whenever

516
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,520
a bgp spf speaker

517
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,039
consider its link up or down

518
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,919
so this will trigger

519
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,600
the advertisement

520
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,720
for these link states to order loads

521
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,640
through all the

522
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,440
bgps pf sessions

523
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,880
in the network

524
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,280
for example consider this symbol

525
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,280
topology

526
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,480
so when node a consider its link for

527
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,120
example link from a to d is up

528
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,640
so node a

529
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,000
will send

530
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,840
this link states about this link up

531
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,280
to

532
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,400
all

533
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
the peers

534
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,000
through all the

535
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,720
section sessions for example node a will

536
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,559
see the four

537
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,679
copies of

538
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,159
the same link states

539
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,320
to

540
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,000
al

541
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,760
through four sessions

542
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,480
so first session from a to b and then

543
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,480
second session also from a to b

544
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,400
and then the third session is from a to

545
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,120
c

546
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,080
and then the fourth session is from a to

547
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,039
d

548
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,799
and then after receiving these things

549
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,039
states the answer those were to the

550
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,280
similar scenes where fl will send those

551
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,400
links space

552
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,919
also along the surgeons

553
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,120
so this is a flooding procedure of is

554
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,919
illustrated in those kind of blue

555
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,640
green arrows so we can see we have lots

556
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,760
of

557
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,240
links left latins

558
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,039
so that's page

559
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,520
so revise revised plotting procedure in

560
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,960
ir model so in this

561
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,360
revise the procedure

562
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,679
bgp speaker

563
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,799
will only send its link states

564
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,039
to sum of

565
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,799
root reflectors

566
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,480
and then after receiving listening

567
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,799
states so these

568
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,400
root reflectors

569
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,200
will send the link states to the other

570
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,480
pgp speakers for example

571
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,919
node a

572
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,120
will only

573
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,280
send its unique space

574
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,120
to only one

575
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,919
rooted reflected ir1 for example

576
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,960
and then r1 after receiving the link

577
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,559
states from node a

578
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,919
it will send that

579
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,400
that links it to b and c

580
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,840
so we can see that node b and c receives

581
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,240
only one copies and then we don't have a

582
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,279
redundant copies for the same in states

583
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,159
so this compared to the normal flooding

584
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,039
procedure and then we reduce the

585
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:53,039
demand flooding by half so next page

586
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,960
so revised

587
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,520
revised a flooding procedure

588
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,559
uh

589
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,799
so this is another option

590
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,039
for revise the operating procedure for

591
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,799
our in the rr model so in this option

592
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,480
so we we

593
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,159
we divide

594
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,240
all the nodes

595
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,840
evenly

596
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,640
into number of groups

597
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,200
and each group will send their link

598
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,080
states

599
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,760
to only one root reflectors

600
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,400
so for example

601
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,720
first group will send it to their link

602
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,240
state to the first

603
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,400
rotor reflector and then the second

604
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,240
group wasn't there mixed it to the

605
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,440
second

606
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,679
root of reflector and so on

607
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,120
since we evenly divided the level loads

608
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,799
into number of groups

609
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,919
so

610
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,000
the

611
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,440
work node

612
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,240
is balanced among all the root

613
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,720
reflectors

614
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,600
so next page

615
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,799
so uh

616
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,200
we're talking about a revised revised

617
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,640
flag procedure

618
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,799
in node connections mode

619
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,679
so in this mode

620
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,159
the procedure the revised flooding

621
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,080
procedure is similar

622
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,720
to the one in the igp blocking reduction

623
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,000
so basically

624
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,720
every node in the network

625
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,679
will have a flooding topology so this

626
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,240
fundamentally we can obtain that in two

627
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,480
ways in one way is that

628
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,440
in in distributed mode every node will

629
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,480
compute its own flooding topology using

630
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,799
a same

631
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,240
algorithm so the second

632
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,760
option is that

633
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,279
in centralized mode we have a leader and

634
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,440
then that leader will compute a flooding

635
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,000
topology and then leader will distribute

636
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,120
this flooding technology to ever node

637
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,400
so with this flooding topology every

638
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,360
node

639
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,679
will send

640
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,840
the link states

641
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,520
to

642
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,520
the peers

643
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,640
which is connected by link

644
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,360
on the flooding topology or say we just

645
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,760
do the flooding along the flooding

646
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,320
topologies is not where we are mounted

647
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,480
to the flooding along the real flag

648
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
topologies for example

649
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,320
on the left side we have a flooding

650
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,880
topology for the real electrical

651
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,760
topology on the right side

652
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,960
so when node a

653
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,480
consider one of these is link is

654
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,760
know the way will only send

655
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,240
is the link states for this link

656
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,120
along the flooding topologies so node a

657
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,000
will only see the two copies of its link

658
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,559
space one is along the

659
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,200
link on the flood property from a to b

660
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,559
and then the other one is from a to d

661
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,960
this is along the larger homology

662
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,760
from a to d

663
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,880
so

664
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,799
so this we can see

665
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,360
so the blue blue arrow illustrates the

666
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,760
flooding uh

667
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,080
along the flooding topologies we can see

668
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,039
that

669
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,159
the amount of flood link state flooding

670
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,520
using this a revised procedure

671
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,799
is reduced a lot compared to the normal

672
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,960
vlogging procedures we

673
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,240
we talked about

674
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,159
in the previous slides

675
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,480
next page

676
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,320
so this page just describes our

677
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,840
procedures

678
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
or algorithms for computer flooding

679
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,120
topology

680
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,360
for sp for ptp spf so this algorithm is

681
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,399
similar to the one in itp

682
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,679
flooding

683
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:50,720
topological

684
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,200
computation so the only difference is

685
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,240
that

686
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,279
we consider some special

687
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,399
attributes

688
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,760
in bgp spf so this difference is

689
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,799
highlighted highlighted here so in bgp

690
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,600
spf uh we have some node

691
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,559
which

692
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,240
do not support uh transit so we

693
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,080
so in this algorithm we'll consider this

694
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,159
a special case so for for the nodes

695
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,880
which do not support transit so we will

696
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,960
consider that one in the

697
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,600
leader election so we'll

698
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,799
we will

699
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,640
we shouldn't elect

700
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,080
the leaders

701
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,960
that

702
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,200
doesn't support transit

703
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,840
so in addition so when we compute the

704
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,360
flooding technologies

705
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,960
we will minimize the connections

706
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,559
to the

707
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,039
node that do not support transit so

708
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,520
that's the only difference compared to

709
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,480
the one in the idp flooding topology

710
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,760
computation algorithm next page

711
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,000
so proper extensions

712
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,200
so this product extension just uh is

713
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,600
quite similar to the one

714
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,240
in in igp flooding reduction

715
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,399
so as maybe some kind of a difference

716
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,919
for example because we have different

717
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,200
mode in bgp spf so

718
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,480
we have a

719
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,840
special

720
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,039
one for

721
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,559
bp spf flight reaction so why is a node

722
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,320
flat plv so this tlv contains a flood

723
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,480
behavior field

724
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,240
so this

725
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,120
field will indicate the behavior network

726
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,520
node will take for flopping

727
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,520
so for example number one indicate that

728
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,480
network node will send the link states

729
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,120
to the root reflector with the minimum

730
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,640
node ids

731
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,720
so number two will indicate

732
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,440
the

733
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,720
load will send

734
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,080
link states

735
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,520
to the rr with maximum

736
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,840
node ids and so on so

737
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,240
the leader

738
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,440
root reflector will use this trv

739
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,760
to tell every node

740
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,600
how to flood

741
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,678
its link states so next page

742
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,720
so this is a leader preference tlv

743
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,000
so this trv contains priority field

744
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,320
and the algorithm field the priority

745
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,520
field

746
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,679
indicates that

747
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,760
the nodes priority

748
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,720
for become a leader so

749
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,760
every node can use this tail v

750
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,720
to advertise its priority

751
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,559
to become a reader

752
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,120
this tlv also contains a field

753
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,520
for algorithm so this

754
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,960
algorithm

755
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,640
is a number so it's mean zero means

756
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,760
centralized

757
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,720
computation of for following topology if

758
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,279
it's non-zero which means that its

759
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,840
algorithm will be

760
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,519
used by every node

761
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,799
to compute uh flooding topology so

762
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,600
leader load will use this field to tell

763
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,440
every node

764
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,600
with either centralize the flight

765
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,480
interpreter computation or

766
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,120
indicate the algorithm evernote will be

767
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,760
used to compute its own flight topology

768
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,399
next page

769
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,559
so algorithms support trv so this

770
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,760
trv contains number of algorithm numbers

771
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,640
so

772
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,000
every node

773
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
in the distributed mode

774
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,080
may use this tail v

775
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,320
to announce

776
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,960
that the i'm support

777
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,679
another number of algorithms so next

778
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,000
page

779
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,320
so node id prv so this node.idtlv is

780
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,640
used in the centralized mode

781
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,519
so this trv contains a number of node

782
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,640
ids first load id segment id and so on

783
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,960
and also

784
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,279
contains a starting index

785
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,039
so this information provides a map

786
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,360
node id first one id

787
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,559
has

788
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,840
index starting index the second node id

789
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,480
has a starting index plus one and so on

790
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,440
so this is a node id to know the

791
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,480
indexing um my mic

792
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,760
so

793
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,200
just

794
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,320
know

795
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,080
i think we have a question from coyotes

796
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,760
in the queue right now

797
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,080
okay

798
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,960
i just had a quick question i can wait

799
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,760
till you are done with the presentation

800
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,200
yeah goodness thank you yeah yeah that's

801
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,960
that'll be better

802
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,360
okay i will wait

803
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,080
yeah so neither node

804
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,360
will

805
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,360
send this node my pin to every node in

806
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,719
the network next page

807
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,880
so pass through these

808
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,240
so pass trv contains index y index to

809
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,760
index three so this in each index is we

810
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,919
is uh associated with a node

811
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,080
so this trv encode a part of foraging

812
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,399
topologies in fact it's encoded a

813
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,080
convention

814
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,200
from node with index 1 to node with

815
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,720
index 2 and then connection from node

816
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,240
with index 2

817
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,519
to node with index 3 and so on

818
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,000
so next page

819
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,440
so connection

820
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,760
used for flooding

821
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,200
so this

822
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,799
trv

823
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,080
just contains no quality and remote id

824
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,720
which is specified connection so this

825
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,919
connection

826
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,279
is on the flooding topology and which is

827
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,760
really used for the flooding

828
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,480
so next page

829
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,800
so uh i would like to receive feedback

830
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,520
and comments thank you any questions

831
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,879
yeah this is kev patel arkis a quick

832
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,359
question how does this work with partial

833
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,520
implementations so

834
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,520
if you have a network with two route

835
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,679
reflectors in your

836
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,760
previous slide that you had with three

837
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,879
nodes

838
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,520
if only one route reflector implements

839
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,560
this extension or one of the three nodes

840
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,040
implement this extension

841
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,440
how does this still work

842
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,440
yeah that's a good question

843
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,560
so we can consider the

844
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,599
uh

845
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,760
the normal case right the load

846
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
connection model so

847
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,800
if some of uh

848
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,599
some of the nodes in the network

849
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,800
have these uh features multiple action

850
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,280
and the rest of or some of the

851
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,440
only support flight direction so that

852
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,480
will is okay because

853
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,480
on the node with flooding reduction and

854
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,520
then they just flatter on the subset of

855
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,960
lighting topology so when those

856
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,800
linguists reach to the node the donor

857
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,599
support and then those of the world

858
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,400
or send the needs to every node connect

859
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,880
to itself so that way we'll work

860
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,920
but for the uh

861
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,240
uh fast mode or

862
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,560
router reflector mode that one gives

863
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,079
some uh

864
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,720
if some are

865
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,760
okay i see i think it's your turn

866
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,000
yeah i opened up my audio the ac linda

867
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,320
my cisco systems i was just gonna say

868
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,640
that maybe what you're doing with the

869
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,480
splitting the route reflectors and

870
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,720
having that may be enough

871
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,480
i mean we already support uh

872
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,079
sparser bgp spf by virtual supports you

873
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,200
know uh

874
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,920
sparser uh sessions you know depending

875
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,320
on how much redundancy you want now what

876
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,880
you're doing with the two with with

877
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,560
selecting only one rr for groups and

878
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,040
making sure all those cases

879
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,119
that may be enough rather than going the

880
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,960
whole ball of wax and supporting many

881
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,560
different algorithms like we're doing in

882
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,520
the igp centralized and distributed

883
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,359
i'm thinking that might be

884
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,480
be going

885
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,200
i can't even think to what that does to

886
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,440
bgp but uh

887
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,680
that's just my comment i'm thinking just

888
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,400
focus it you know have maybe have have

889
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
have those case the simple case where

890
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,200
you

891
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,000
just uh

892
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,520
prefer one route reflector

893
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,280
split off and this whole thing with the

894
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,720
adopting the dynamic flooding uh

895
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,760
algorithm uh framework that we haven't

896
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,720
that we're doing in the igps and bgp spf

897
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,440
may

898
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,839
may not be needed that's just my comment

899
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,040
thanks

900
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,599
yeah yeah yeah and over here

901
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,520
for sparse mode and then we make we

902
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,400
should use a very simple uh procedures

903
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,400
right

904
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,920
it's very similar but i think it could

905
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,000
be it's pretty

906
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,280
complex i mean just i think just getting

907
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,480
uh

908
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,000
you know getting it getting it

909
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,760
implemented we have two implementations

910
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,839
now getting that implemented then if on

911
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,760
top of that if somebody did

912
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,800
the extensions to support uh

913
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,440
you know um selection of one route

914
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,520
reflector that would take you a long

915
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,800
ways i mean you already got a pretty

916
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,960
sparse and you and you handle and you

917
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,560
also handle the cases where connections

918
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,640
are lost i mean you probably have the

919
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,800
the two route reflectors of course they

920
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,960
they need to peer with one another and

921
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,920
that needs to be reliable but

922
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,400
other than that uh

923
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,800
i think uh

924
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,480
i mean i i don't know that you need this

925
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,640
whole framework and you

926
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,359
you know you wanna you wanna be able to

927
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,440
run around the block before you attempt

928
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,079
the boston marathon and set this whole

929
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,400
thing up with the dynamic you know look

930
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,320
at how long we've been doing things in

931
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,400
in uh igps

932
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,640
right

933
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,200
i think i think you might want to split

934
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,480
the two out

935
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,839
just because that anyway

936
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,280
okay thank you i can't see that one

937
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,599
thank you

938
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,440
yeah and and then and me you know

939
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,520
speaking of the participant here

940
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,320
so

941
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,400
i'm not sure also that the

942
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,359
floating dynamics of this php spf is

943
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,599
similar you know it's similar enough to

944
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,440
what we are seeing in the igp app

945
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,200
because in the igp world

946
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,359
we're not really relying upon uh

947
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,200
reliable sessions here to send the

948
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,200
updates over while we do have that in

949
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,119
the bgp world

950
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,359
which means you know i think in igp that

951
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,800
is probably uh

952
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,280
like a higher risks of multiplying the

953
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,440
floating dangers here which are not

954
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,680
happening in this case i suspect

955
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,079
uh yeah the bbp is a reliable uh

956
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,359
connection

957
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,359
but the amount of

958
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:42,240
link state sent over the session

959
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,359
so that one is similar to the igp right

960
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,079
even so the link is uh reliable so we

961
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,760
still

962
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,560
will send new states to all the

963
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,720
connections

964
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,280
so the only difference is that pgp

965
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,520
will do the retransmit so or something

966
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,359
like that we're reflecting

967
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,520
every hour or something like that

968
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,720
so that one those kind of reflecting

969
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,040
is limited in the

970
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,880
bgp spf

971
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,079
but

972
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,480
the the amount of interest stays sent

973
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,680
out from all the new sessions is still

974
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,000
there

975
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,839
okay you see

976
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,839
i see you in the queue is that on

977
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,560
purpose or by accident

978
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,079
i think your mute is on or something

979
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,240
like that

980
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,640
thank you before he was talking

981
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,160
from the queue when i after i spoke

982
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,359
any more questions because we do have to

983
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,000
go to the next presenter here so

984
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,440
thank you everyone

985
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,599
thank you

986
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,920
i'm wondering if i should share my

987
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,000
screen there's some minor

988
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,040
very minor animations that might be

989
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,599
helpful for understanding sure if if you

990
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,520
if you want to take that risk you're

991
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,119
more than happy to do so

992
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,839
let's see if it works

993
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,760
so i did this

994
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,319
request but i don't know how

995
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,240
okay i think you have to click grand

996
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,480
screen

997
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,440
yes okay

998
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,640
okay i think maybe it's working yeah we

999
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,760
got the infinite yeah yeah yes yes

1000
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,680
okay

1001
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,599
um

1002
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,560
okay

1003
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,720
does that is that

1004
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,560
displaying true yes yes perfect okay

1005
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,240
all right thanks i'll go ahead and jump

1006
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,400
in and try to get quick move quickly for

1007
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,640
discussion um

1008
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,520
so this is a an update again i've done a

1009
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,079
few in the past um which i'll talk about

1010
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,319
this as a start out as disclaimer here

1011
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,800
since i'm talking about an ieee

1012
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,640
standards activity i need to point out

1013
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,880
that the this is my own personal view of

1014
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,480
that um i've been obviously

1015
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,640
participating in that but and i think my

1016
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,880
view is accurate but it is my view not

1017
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,520
uh position of the standards board here

1018
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,640
so

1019
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,400
obligatory slide

1020
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,520
so first of all um we were motivated by

1021
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,040
the requirements of

1022
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,560
l3dl

1023
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,800
and other use cases i think like idr and

1024
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,720
some others that

1025
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,000
there was a need to update lldp

1026
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,920
to allow the sharing of more than one

1027
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,240
frames worth of information

1028
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,000
so i'm referencing some previous

1029
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,400
presentations where we went through that

1030
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,480
requirements discussion and frankly it

1031
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,440
was time to do an update to lldp

1032
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,319
and we know that lsvr had had evaluated

1033
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,040
lodp as a potential transport

1034
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,680
for sharing bootstrapping information

1035
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,359
and it wasn't sufficient and this was

1036
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,680
one of the key issues

1037
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,359
so anyway we

1038
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,280
proposed to fix that if you will and we

1039
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,599
started a project in

1040
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,079
uh 802.1 called 802.1 abdh

1041
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,119
that was intended to allow support

1042
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,440
multi-frame protocol

1043
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,040
data units in lldp so i have a link here

1044
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,040
to the project page if you you know you

1045
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,200
can track all the the history and things

1046
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,880
that have happened

1047
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,960
so from a timeline perspective uh the

1048
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,000
way it works in in 802.1 versus you know

1049
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,839
ietf we go through a number of different

1050
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,079
balloting phases the first step is to

1051
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,640
get a project uh authorized and

1052
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,880
requested and that actually happened

1053
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,240
back in september of 2019

1054
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,960
and so not a lot happened until really

1055
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,200
almost a year because we were looking

1056
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,880
for an editor and you know kind of

1057
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,319
dragging our feet or whatnot that

1058
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,760
technically we thought we knew what we

1059
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,040
were doing but

1060
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,839
um we finally secured an editor with

1061
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,960
some help from some other people

1062
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,960
and uh that's he's an excellent editor

1063
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,880
steve uh haddock who i've listed on the

1064
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,200
slide deck here anyway we entered the

1065
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,760
phases of balloting um and the first

1066
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,760
phase is task group balloting which is

1067
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,599
where you know it's kind of open focused

1068
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,920
group of people we did two two rounds of

1069
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,680
task group balloting before we went to

1070
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,079
what we call working group balloting and

1071
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,720
this is where it's uh mandatory for

1072
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,720
working group members to pay attention

1073
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,680
and vote

1074
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,359
uh we did three rounds of of that um

1075
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,119
and and then we went to what we call

1076
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,119
standards association ballot which is

1077
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,800
kind of the final phase

1078
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,359
uh where it's open to uh pretty much

1079
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,839
anybody in the ieee that's the standards

1080
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,319
association member and um

1081
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,480
we did two rounds of uh standard

1082
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,880
association balloting so any technical

1083
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,359
changes are typically completed during

1084
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,200
the working group task group and working

1085
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,400
group phases

1086
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,480
we're now at this revcom approval which

1087
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,480
is where we're basically the document is

1088
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,720
done we're just it's uh you know proving

1089
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,280
it through the process and and going for

1090
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,760
publication i'm not exactly sure the

1091
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,560
date of publication expectation but i do

1092
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,720
believe it's before the end of the year

1093
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,880
so anyway the draft could be

1094
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,119
could be used today there won't be any

1095
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,839
substantive changes

1096
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:36,880
um

1097
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,800
so couple why why were we doing this

1098
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,599
again the main objective was to support

1099
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,839
sending more information that can fit in

1100
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,040
a single

1101
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,480
frame so lldp was very simple protocol

1102
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,400
that only shared one frame at a time but

1103
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,720
now we've sort of optimized for sharing

1104
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,160
something along the order of let's say

1105
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,520
100k bytes when we first did this

1106
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,839
it was believed in here in lsvr that

1107
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,599
something along the order of 60k bytes

1108
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:02,800
was needed

1109
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,720
i'm not sure what the upper limit is now

1110
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,720
but it it's it's probably bigger than

1111
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,920
100k

1112
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,839
uh as well but we could actually do the

1113
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:10,800
math

1114
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,400
um and we wanted to also allow to the

1115
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,520
ability to shrink lldp frame sizes too

1116
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,280
for certain deployments uh there's a lot

1117
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,000
of effort in time-sensitive networking

1118
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,160
where timing is is very important and so

1119
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,960
sending smaller frames was a useful uh

1120
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,280
outcome of this as well

1121
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,040
one big objective we had was we wanted

1122
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,960
this to still be able to communicate

1123
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,319
with old lldp implementations obviously

1124
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,960
only one frames worth of information but

1125
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,560
it's designed to talk to old

1126
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,800
implementations as well

1127
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,040
and if you support the extensions then

1128
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,000
you can send more information

1129
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,280
you know we want to make sure what we're

1130
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,200
sending is valid

1131
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,400
we allow

1132
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,560
the mechanism allows what we call pacing

1133
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,040
of receiving of those frames by the

1134
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,720
receiver so in other words if you have a

1135
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,640
very lightweight implementation we're

1136
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,359
not going to overload you uh you you

1137
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,839
receive the extra data at your own speed

1138
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,359
so to speak

1139
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:08,560
and that's important there's a lot of

1140
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,920
very constrained implementations of lldp

1141
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,079
and then we didn't want to add any

1142
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,880
additional uh you know network traffic

1143
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,160
so it's a periodic protocol lldp is in

1144
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,000
general but when we add a bunch of extra

1145
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,319
frames we don't want to be uselessly

1146
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,720
broadcasting those around so the the

1147
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,319
protocol doesn't

1148
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,800
add any really additional network

1149
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,119
traffic uh in its design

1150
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,359
so just as a quick reminder this is how

1151
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,160
original lldp works you you think of it

1152
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,119
as

1153
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,240
uh each agent adds a has a database is

1154
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,559
what we call his local database of

1155
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,800
information that he wants to share to

1156
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,200
his neighbor and the neighbor maintains

1157
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,200
what's a remote database which is just a

1158
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,480
copy of that

1159
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,559
and so then basically it's a simple

1160
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,559
simple protocol right periodically a

1161
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:59,200
timer goes off and you just send your

1162
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,359
database to your neighbor and again

1163
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,119
remember it was one frame

1164
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,200
and then that neighbor would receive it

1165
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,440
and effectively replace everything that

1166
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,359
was there before with what you just

1167
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:12,400
received so things get wiped out it's uh

1168
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,079
you know then the the sender would do

1169
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,880
the same whenever anything he changes or

1170
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,440
if our timer goes off that he hasn't

1171
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,920
updated his information lately

1172
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,000
then he just sends a frame

1173
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,599
and of course if you change something

1174
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,599
locally in your database then we try to

1175
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,599
send that frame immediately

1176
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,760
uh with some kind of rate limiting kind

1177
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,760
of thing so that we don't overload

1178
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,079
implementations but you can get your

1179
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,760
information propagated relatively

1180
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,960
quickly

1181
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,280
so that's lldp version one the simple

1182
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,359
one very widely deployed lots and lots

1183
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,280
of use cases

1184
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,599
and so what we did to allow additional

1185
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,079
frames to be added was

1186
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,400
uh created you know an extension

1187
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,160
protocol if you will that has what we

1188
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,839
call receiver facing

1189
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,400
so in this scenario let's assume you

1190
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,800
know something changes on this left

1191
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,880
agent's local mib

1192
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,480
he sends out a single lldp frame a new

1193
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,240
you know it's the same lldp frame as it

1194
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,280
was before but it contains an additional

1195
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,359
a new tlv

1196
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,440
that's called a manifest tlv and that

1197
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,319
manifest tlb describes that there's more

1198
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:21,359
information available to be retrieved

1199
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,200
and so what happens is the receiving

1200
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,640
agent then now sends back a extension

1201
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,319
request frame

1202
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,559
saying i want the rest of your data

1203
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,720
specifying specifically what data he

1204
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,680
wants

1205
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,000
and then the sender will send an

1206
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,040
extension pdu which is a a

1207
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,200
looks like an lldp frame but it's got a

1208
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,720
special format

1209
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,880
uh and so then the receiver will collect

1210
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,839
that information until he gets it all

1211
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,920
uh as soon as he gets it all then he

1212
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,520
updates the local mib so from above

1213
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,240
uh api level if you will it it looks

1214
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,040
exactly the same applications that run

1215
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,119
on llbp look exactly the same they just

1216
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,280
have more data they can send and receive

1217
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,640
than they used to

1218
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,280
but below we have this extra protocol

1219
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,040
and then there's still a periodic thing

1220
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,040
that happens you know every every so

1221
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,880
often that you'll still send your one

1222
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,720
lldp frame

1223
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,400
and if nothing's changed in your

1224
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,400
extension database then

1225
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,240
nothing happens it just on the other

1226
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,040
side he just up refreshes that basic

1227
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,440
information so it's pretty simple

1228
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,720
protocol

1229
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,400
extension that we did

1230
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,200
so

1231
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,079
in doing it what we had to do was define

1232
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,160
three new tlvs and two new pdus or lld

1233
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,440
pdus

1234
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,920
so uh and there's details in the backup

1235
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,440
i won't go into but

1236
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,480
there's a manifest tlb which is this new

1237
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,200
one that describes uh all of the other

1238
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,160
extension pdus that are available so you

1239
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,720
send out this manifest thing i have you

1240
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,200
know 10 more lldp frames and here's what

1241
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,200
they look like here's their numbering

1242
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,559
system whatever

1243
00:50:58,559 --> 00:50:59,920
and then uh

1244
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,960
then when you send a request uh

1245
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,559
for one of those pdus you you include

1246
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,040
this extension request tlb

1247
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,440
and then when you're sending your

1248
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,800
extension pdu you add the

1249
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,359
uh extension pdu tlb to the frame so

1250
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,280
there's three new tlbs

1251
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,119
and then there's these are the pdus

1252
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,440
there's already the quote normal

1253
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,599
pdu so that one remains the same it

1254
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,559
looks the same uh however if you add

1255
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,640
this manifest tlb

1256
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,839
then you're now saying i have more data

1257
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,160
because this manifest tlb is is wasn't

1258
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,079
defined in the first version

1259
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,160
implementations uh

1260
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,839
backward compatible implementations

1261
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,520
would simply ignore it

1262
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,400
uh that's their that's how the protocol

1263
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,400
was specified they would store it

1264
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,400
perhaps as an opaque data but they would

1265
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,599
ignore it

1266
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,400
um and then this new these new pdus are

1267
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,559
extension request and the actual

1268
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,880
extension pdu itself

1269
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,760
uh we use unicast addressing here or we

1270
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,160
specify the actual address so you flip

1271
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,559
from a multicast protocol to a unicast

1272
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,559
when you're doing the extensions that

1273
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,400
avoids a lot of confusion and flooding

1274
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,880
in the network

1275
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,760
and then you you have specifications in

1276
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,079
here which exactly how to identify the

1277
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:20,720
pdus so as i mentioned there's details

1278
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,640
in the back i won't i won't go through

1279
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,440
that

1280
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,920
so what are the next steps um we're just

1281
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,000
waiting on that publication effectively

1282
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,160
like i said it's a logistic thing no

1283
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,680
technical details

1284
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,480
there was a draft i wrote uh with paul

1285
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,960
vogtwarf a long time ago that was

1286
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,920
identifying the current set of l3dl tlvs

1287
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,240
and we were proposing well we format

1288
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,440
them in the lldp format um that didn't

1289
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,920
get a lot of uh other

1290
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,480
joiner interests so to speak at the time

1291
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,800
um but you know maybe maybe it would be

1292
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,880
worth considering dusting that off and

1293
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,640
looking at how to share the information

1294
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,480
that's currently being

1295
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,880
exchanged or needs to be exchanged uh

1296
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,559
and then of course we're looking for you

1297
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,359
know someone to update the lldp agent in

1298
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,160
open source world to uh to support this

1299
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,200
new

1300
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,040
activity we we

1301
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,640
i'm not aware of anybody yet doing that

1302
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,240
but that'd be a great project somebody

1303
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,200
was interested in doing that so

1304
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,079
so that's the uh that's the end of the

1305
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,880
update though

1306
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,400
yeah

1307
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,839
yes here uh gunther

1308
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,599
as a chair so also

1309
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,720
before you you mentioned uh

1310
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,960
like security and so onwards because

1311
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,040
like in data centers you know the

1312
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,839
application realm of

1313
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:43,920
lsvr security is a high important thing

1314
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,720
so

1315
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,160
security was mentioned you know in some

1316
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,960
of the previous you know updates but it

1317
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,200
was not in this particular update either

1318
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,160
like

1319
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,079
so so what is the status you know from

1320
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:55,760
that perspective for a lot of people

1321
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,880
right so

1322
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,520
early on we had considered do we should

1323
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,480
we be adding some kind of additional

1324
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,079
tlv to frames that would you know

1325
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,200
either

1326
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,960
put a

1327
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,960
an hmac or something to protect you know

1328
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,720
identify any kind of changes or

1329
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,640
something but not necessarily privacy

1330
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,760
protection

1331
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,480
um we just decided to not do that at

1332
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,680
this time

1333
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,040
for various

1334
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,880
various reasons and complexities with

1335
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,680
security i think the model the security

1336
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,240
that's typically used uh you know in

1337
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,559
802.1 is to try to protect the link

1338
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,240
itself by using something like maxsec

1339
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,640
that would operate below this

1340
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,559
and allow these frames to be both

1341
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,000
privacy and you know integrity protected

1342
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,319
um so that's the sort of the default

1343
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,559
answer is that we would use the 802.1

1344
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,720
security framework to protect this

1345
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,799
rather than instrumenting a specific

1346
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,280
security attribute to this

1347
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,480
um but that could of course be a an

1348
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,960
approach that could be considered um in

1349
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,720
you know in the future if we wanted to

1350
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,640
augment that but we didn't address it

1351
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,720
directly in this protocol

1352
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,839
okay thank you

1353
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,520
any other questions from the people in

1354
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,839
the room

1355
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,359
no okay

1356
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,960
thank you paul thanks for the update

1357
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,799
very interesting very good progress

1358
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,000
appreciate it

1359
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,520
yeah

1360
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,280
see how i stopped there okay

1361
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,559
there's no escape

1362
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,480
we have five minutes

1363
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,000
so we have five minutes left so i think

1364
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,440
the last topic on on the agenda was uh

1365
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,799
to look at

1366
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:44,079
a potential re-charter of of the working

1367
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,799
group itself

1368
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,319
uh victor do you want to say something

1369
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:52,000
about it or should i keep on going

1370
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,559
just yet

1371
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,200
speaking ball

1372
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,000
okay

1373
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,319
okay so so so basic i think we already

1374
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:03,760
mentioned already mentioned this in the

1375
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,000
beginning of uh of the working group

1376
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,200
meeting here

1377
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,160
so

1378
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,240
so now that we are you know

1379
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,119
going towards the end of our

1380
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,520
initial tasks of the working group of

1381
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,280
the lsvr working group with the protocol

1382
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,720
spec itself

1383
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,160
we need to look into how to progress

1384
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,040
uh

1385
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,400
you know the

1386
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,319
maintain the technology

1387
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:30,160
and also on how to further enhance

1388
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,559
another realm of of what we are doing

1389
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,960
and the accompanying technologies

1390
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,079
because you know the pgp spf by itself

1391
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:38,960
you know

1392
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,799
even though it's a very good and fine

1393
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,079
technology

1394
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,680
it seems to need uh the some some

1395
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,799
supplement uh technologies like l3dl or

1396
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,400
lltpv2

1397
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,359
to discover the neighbors and itself

1398
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:54,720
because

1399
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,480
you know unlike a traditional igp the

1400
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,040
technology has been you know has been

1401
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,200
separated between each other

1402
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,200
so from that perspective

1403
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,480
we need to

1404
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,920
augment our charter because that was not

1405
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,480
part of the initial charter itself

1406
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,160
and now that we have more visibility

1407
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,760
that is the track you know we're going

1408
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,400
to we're going to take

1409
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,799
uh so what you will see happening is

1410
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:21,839
from the moment that bgp spf and the

1411
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,480
applicability has been you know uh

1412
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,559
pushed uh upwards

1413
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,400
that we will be starting to discuss in

1414
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,839
our shorter

1415
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:31,680
draft text on the working group itself

1416
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,440
you know we have some texts initially

1417
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,280
you know pre-draft already

1418
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,720
but we're going to be sharing that you

1419
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,280
know very soon after

1420
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,640
uh

1421
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,280
pgp actually has been sent up

1422
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,440
yeah now gunter i guess what the plan

1423
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,920
will have is we'll put that on the list

1424
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,680
and did we have an idea of what

1425
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,520
timelines like i mean we probably don't

1426
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,079
want this to take forever uh how much

1427
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:55,920
time do you think we should put towards

1428
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,400
getting comments in and uh allowing for

1429
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,760
a reasonable amount of input and

1430
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,079
discussion

1431
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,079
now i don't know i personally don't know

1432
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:05,760
how long normally a resharper kind of

1433
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,520
takes but i would hope that you know

1434
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,079
with itf you know 113 we're gonna have

1435
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,319
something you know written down and

1436
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,319
approved hopefully

1437
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,160
yeah i mean that that's we definitely

1438
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,599
would want to be if we're going to have

1439
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:19,520
that recharger completed it should be it

1440
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,839
should be before

1441
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:23,119
113. uh okay that i think that's

1442
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:26,559
timeline and work backwards for

1443
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,880
okay any questions or concerns from the

1444
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,760
working group on this

1445
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,960
let's see

1446
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,839
here to talk

1447
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,799
just a quick question are you in the

1448
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:43,920
queue in in by accident or on purpose

1449
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,119
can you hear me

1450
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,160
yes yes

1451
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,640
yeah this is kev patel uh marcus just a

1452
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,480
quick question so are we looking to

1453
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,880
recharter by 113 is what i heard

1454
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,599
that is the intent

1455
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,119
okay

1456
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,359
and as part of rechartering we want to

1457
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:03,040
include the

1458
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,839
discovery part

1459
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:08,079
[Music]

1460
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:08,960
yes

1461
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,000
correct

1462
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,400
so the intent will not be that you know

1463
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,160
that the charter will mandate like you

1464
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,000
know either l3dl or lntp v2

1465
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,799
but more you know more to include to

1466
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:22,480
work you know up on the discovery

1467
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,000
technology correct yep

1468
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,079
and this is going to be the rechartering

1469
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,400
is going to be very specific to

1470
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,640
discovering technologies in data centers

1471
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,559
it's basically you know the framework of

1472
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,359
the baseline to bring the l3dl work you

1473
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,599
know into the working group correct i i

1474
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,359
understand but my question is more

1475
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:48,000
specific to the text of rechartering

1476
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,040
since lsvr is

1477
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,160
defined for data center extensions i am

1478
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,720
assuming the recharging in context of

1479
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,640
discovery will be also

1480
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,119
for data centers

1481
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,880
or is that going to be on a wider scale

1482
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,559
i think that is something we can

1483
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:08,480
discussion on the working group list

1484
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,079
itself but i know

1485
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,160
my you know as a chair you know we are

1486
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,319
working upon lsvr which is technology

1487
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,160
you know tailored for data centers so i

1488
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,599
think that is going to be our initial

1489
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:18,960
focus of course

1490
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,760
super thank you

1491
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,200
probably room for only one more quick

1492
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,799
one and then we have to probably keep

1493
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,440
going um

1494
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,960
just so you know

1495
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,240
that

1496
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,160
l3dl is

1497
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,319
among the technologies being discussed

1498
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:38,640
in idr

1499
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,440
which

1500
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,839
for bgp peer discovery and this segment

1501
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:46,319
of the idr work is

1502
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:49,359
focused on data center

1503
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:50,480
so

1504
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,480
um

1505
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,720
i

1506
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,599
understand chaos concern

1507
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,640
for understanding the focus here

1508
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,440
and uh

1509
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,160
enough said

1510
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:11,839
okay thank you randy

1511
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,760
i'm just gonna point out that you know

1512
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,359
that recharger has to go through the

1513
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:17,839
iesg so it we might have we might have

1514
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:20,799
it ready to go by 13 and then do the

1515
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:21,839
final

1516
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:24,319
and then push it after that you know you

1517
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:26,240
have it it has an approval process just

1518
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,119
like

1519
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:28,559
a document

1520
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,319
the recharger

1521
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,319
agreed and it's like

1522
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:34,960
depends upon how many more years we sit

1523
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,839
on our thumbs doesn't

1524
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:40,319
it that's true

1525
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,319
okay so let's do this let's put let's

1526
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,240
put this to the list uh obviously we can

1527
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,280
we can we can finish off this

1528
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,119
conversation there i think there needs

1529
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,960
to be some clarity in terms of

1530
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,960
what what we're focusing on i think here

1531
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,039
was reasonably correct and that you know

1532
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:56,880
original charter was we were focusing on

1533
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,000
data center

1534
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,559
uh protocol operation and this discovery

1535
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,960
would have been in context with that

1536
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,960
irrespective of maybe wider potential

1537
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,559
clickability

1538
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:09,359
um is that fair

1539
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,880
i think so

1540
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,000
yeah

1541
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,920
okay so we'll have to take this to the

1542
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,119
list because i think we're we're two

1543
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:16,480
minutes over now

1544
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,000
yes i think we're at the end of the

1545
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,760
meeting so i think we have to close it

1546
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,119
down otherwise we're gonna get kicked

1547
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,280
out

1548
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,200
okay thanks everybody

1549
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,400
bye-bye

1550
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,839
thank you bye

1551
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,160
