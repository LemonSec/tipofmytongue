1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,320
so uh let's do that

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,520
my name is mia clement i'm the iab chair

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,760
and today russ white is sharing with me

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,080
who is also on the iub

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,160
and i think we start right away or russ

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,920
do you want to add something

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,480
yeah let me show um the note well uh

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,240
probably have seen this by by now

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,080
already even so this is an ib meeting

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
it's still a contribution to the ietf so

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,400
you should be aware of the ipr rules and

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,880
all other participation rules

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,399
especially

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,399
please notice our code of conduct and

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,879
the entertainment procedures which are

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:39,840
also

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,719
linked here on the slide

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,399
i don't think we had problems in this

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,239
meeting but it's generally important to

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,320
be friendly to each other to respect

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,399
each other to provide constructive

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,680
feedback to be welcoming newcomers um so

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,600
in that sense hopefully we can provide

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,520
uh some good contributions in this

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,120
meeting as well so please keep that in

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,280
mind also um not only when you speak up

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,959
but also everywhere and also in the chat

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,279
okay

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,680
yes so we have always have this like

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,280
what is ib open because it's kind of

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,520
still relatively new um but it's not

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,040
that new anymore more we do it for

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,640
nearly two years now

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,560
um so this is really an organized

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,400
session by the iav to focus on some

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,320
technical and architectural topics and

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,520
discussions

38
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,240
and for two purposes one is to increase

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,320
the visibility of what the iap is doing

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,960
also to have a forum to to discuss with

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,479
the community and get feedback from the

42
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,840
community that's what we're doing here

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,079
um

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,439
i wanted to provide a little bit more

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,600
information about how to reach the iab

46
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,439
um i usually have this on the slides

47
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,040
that you can reach the iab directly with

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,600
an email to iab iab.org

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,399
and what we noticed is that not

50
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,399
everybody's aware that not only iab

51
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,399
members are listening to this list

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,479
so we have some people from staff also

53
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,240
on this list in our lives and these kind

54
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,799
of people um so we put this information

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,439
now everywhere where you you might look

56
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,119
for it on the web page and these kind of

57
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,439
things i also want to know people hear

58
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,239
about this so that is where

59
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,239
if you if you have financial information

60
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,400
free to send it to directly for example

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,360
if you want to sure only go to limited

62
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,800
set of people

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,160
um we have the iap list to reach ib we

64
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,599
also have some

65
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,200
other lists we have the architecture

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,040
discuss list which is really an open

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,280
list for community edition and that's

68
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,560
where all the discussion about

69
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,319
architectural and technical topics

70
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,800
happen and also related to ib documents

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
so feel to subscribe there and free to

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,120
post there and start a discussion we

73
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,519
have just made an open mailing list for

74
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,720
prims where the community can also um

75
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,879
subscribe and engage in a topic that

76
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,720
leads to the program you can propose

77
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,440
topics that are related to program scope

78
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,760
and we have this there's no coordination

79
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,000
and mailing it's not a mating list it's

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,640
just an alias basically um which is

81
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,560
relatively new so this is a direct way

82
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,440
if you have any questions about liaisons

83
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,040
to reach somebody or to reach the right

84
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,799
person from the iab about that

85
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,280
okay um so um as we're talking about the

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,200
technical work the iap's doing here so

87
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,440
we will give you a quick update a very

88
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,959
um domain's workshop uh programs so on

89
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,159
and then we have some presentations

90
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,720
so updates we actually have done quite a

91
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,440
bit of work um like um we have published

92
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,400
new document which is rcm 9120 so that

93
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
was um some

94
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,599
work about

95
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,519
cleanups for up but basically not too

96
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,599
exciting but it's a new document

97
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,040
um we have uh one document which is just

98
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,680
i would send out for um

99
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,599
no one document which is already

100
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,239
approved by iab for publication and will

101
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,879
come out as an rfc very soon

102
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,439
um and we have uh still one document

103
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,040
that is under discussion in the ib so

104
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,519
it's already adopted as my document um

105
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,959
and we are working on it and you will

106
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,519
hopefully see some progress on that soon

107
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,519
we have a brand new shop report out

108
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,760
there which was submitted just um

109
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,480
this week uh on the last workshop that

110
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,080
we organized and west we'll talk about

111
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,040
that

112
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,599
and we are running a call for community

113
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,519
feedback about a new document that we

114
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,358
would like to adopt in the iab and start

115
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,040
working on so that's probably the most

116
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,720
important part if you if you want to

117
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,639
provide feedback on this document um

118
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,639
please send it directly to us or go to

119
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,320
the architecture to discuss this that's

120
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,360
where most of the discussion is

121
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,759
happening

122
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,960
um

123
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,800
i just got a note that my audio and

124
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,639
video is a little bit shoppy is that

125
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,520
true for everybody

126
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,520
because then i turn off my videos it's

127
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,880
not invisible right now we can

128
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
it's not horrible but

129
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,880
you're definitely on the edge okay

130
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,400
maybe this is because my partner is

131
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,759
sitting in the other room also having

132
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,479
video calls as you have it today

133
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,160
so if you don't hear me just read the

134
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,840
slides right it's the same

135
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,280
um

136
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,280
okay so program updates we have an

137
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,360
update later on on the edm program so i

138
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,800
will not say much we have a second

139
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,639
technical program running um which is a

140
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,199
model t program uh there was an iab

141
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,960
review there was a little bit of silence

142
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,639
recently and there was just a new

143
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,639
discussion i'm started right now to

144
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,680
figure out how this group could like

145
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,840
get rescued or continue some work so

146
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440

no i think that's about right um we do

156
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,520
need to get it moving because it's

157
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,039
interesting work and we just need to

158
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,039
like figure out how to

159
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,360

uh

165
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,360
one more program which is you know not

166
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,840
the classical iab technical program uh

167
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,520
it's it's a special case here because it

168
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,039
works more like working group like a

169
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,120
community um program but you might or

170
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,720
might not be aware of this program it's

171
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,319
the ioc future editor development

172
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,280
program

173
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,520
and this program is working on a new

174
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,000
model for the rfc editor and effectively

175
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,400
it has concluded most of its work and

176
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,560
there is one document one draft that is

177
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,080
redefining this new model and the

178
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,919
working group last call the program last

179
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,560
call ended last friday so there are

180
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,960
still a few issues to clear out but

181
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,280
nothing big anymore the model as it's

182
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,919
described here in the slide kind of

183
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,600
there's still an opportunity to provide

184
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,880
more feedback there will be more

185
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,479
community calls before we actually

186
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,319
publish this so please

187
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,479
look at the document not right now read

188
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,880
it provide feedback um to the program

189
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,319
mailing list

190
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,080
and you can also probably join the next

191
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,199
end of our meeting we had a meeting

192
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,440
yesterday and there were not we're still

193
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,599
a few open issues but so we might need

194
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,199
another interim but it's it's nothing

195
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,039
big left so this is really coming to an

196
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,440
end now

197
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,039
and then um iab workshops so another

198
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,560
part of the technical work we're doing

199
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,880
and so we had a workshop on measuring

200
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,919
internet uh called internet measuring

201
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,759
network quality for end users in

202
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,639
september and that was really uh

203
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,599
quite well visited we had a huge amount

204
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,680
of contributions and very a lot of

205
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,360
people in the workshop i unfolded and

206
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,960
joined but wes will tell you more about

207
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,280
this later and as i said the report is

208
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,560
just out of first version the first

209
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,800
draft version um but you might be able

210
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,080
to already find some information there

211
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,759
that's interesting for you

212
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,199
and then we have another workshop that

213
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,960
we will organize end of november and

214
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,759
that workshop isn't analyzing ietf data

215
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,080
um so here the idea really is to look at

216
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,800
the data that we provide um the metadata

217
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,960
drafts in the data tracker about for

218
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,879
example authorship participation and so

219
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,879
on and figure out if we can learn

220
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,280
something from it if we can see trends

221
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
and what we can analyze and effectively

222
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,039
there's a bunch of researchers who are

223
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,879
already looking into this so we thought

224
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,639
it's good to have everybody in the room

225
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,479
and talk to them and tell them what we

226
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,000
would be interested in and see if we can

227
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,080
learn something from it and you know how

228
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,840
our community looks like and how it

229
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,520
involves and how we can improve things

230
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,680
in in the process and in the community

231
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,800
so that's coming up uh and

232
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,879
we will uh push the recordings afterward

233
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,400
and i will probably report back at the

234
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,440
next ietf meeting

235
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,519
and with that um

236
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,159
we go properly to the next presentation

237
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,000
except so as i said there will be a

238
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,039
presentation from the edm program and

239
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,479
there will be a presentation from the

240
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,839
last workshop

241
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,920
um and i forgot an s here so the

242
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,519
representation the workshop presentation

243
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,839
is not given by we but by with

244
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,360
um

245
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,440
so um you know if there's no agenda

246
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,200
bashing or any questions about what i

247
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,800
just

248
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,320
showed um we can move on with tommy

249
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,680
but if anybody wants to jump in the

250
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,480
queue it's your time now

251
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,279
or if you want to add something

252
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,920
so i stopped sharing and tommy is coming

253
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,319
up that's great

254
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,320
all right

255
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,320
asking to share slides thank you

256
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,640
all right so um

257
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,880
i'm tommy pauly one of the leads for the

258
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,480
edm program

259
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,800
my uh co-lead david is not here he is

260
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,880
the one who has the light up suits that

261
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,760
go well with the edm theme um i can only

262
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,560
give you this slide i apologize

263
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
um anyway so this is our technical

264
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,959
program on evolvability deployability

265
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,720
and maintainability

266
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,640
everyone is free to join the mailing

267
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,399
list please do it if you're interested

268
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,600
as a quick status update we've had two

269
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,079
calls since the last ietf meeting and

270
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,279
the last iab open

271
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,720
one of those was to wrap up on draft ib

272
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,959
user to lose it

273
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,000
which

274
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,959
was

275
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,640
mainly authored by martin thompson and

276
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,720
then we kind of completed it in the

277
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,560
working group that is currently in the

278
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,720
rfc editor queue and should be published

279
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,560
soon so

280
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
really happy that we can get that moved

281
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,920
along i think that's going to be a very

282
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,720
useful contribution

283
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,079
so now we're essentially moving on to

284
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,040
starting up some new efforts um

285
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,640
there's another existing draft that

286
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,000
we're looking at

287
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
but the thing i want to talk about today

288
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,640
is what we had our last meeting on

289
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,160
which was discussing how we track

290
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,760
protocol implementations and

291
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,839
deployability

292
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,079
all right so why does this matter why

293
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,240
are we talking about this in an ib

294
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,120
program why in this program

295
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,040
i mean overall

296
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,600
running code is how we determine

297
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,120
deployability before we ship our

298
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,519
protocols it's a very important part of

299
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,519
our process here

300
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,519
and as we're looking at

301
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,000
the evolvability of protocols and how

302
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,600
well they can be deployed

303
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,360
understanding

304
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,200
kind of the practical aspects of how our

305
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,600
implementation's working

306
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,760
helps us get a clearer and more

307
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,560
practical view

308
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,720
so

309
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,040
tracking the implementations uh is also

310
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,440
a way to help implementations do

311
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,920
interrupt testing we see a lot of

312
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,600
success in working groups that are able

313
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,680
to do a lot of interop

314
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,640
testing and that helps them

315
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,880
validate that their protocol is working

316
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,560
and will be deployable

317
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,160
on the internet uh

318
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,680
dealing with middle boxes and

319
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,279
understanding where ossification has

320
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,920
already happened

321
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,519
um also you know looking long-term

322
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,240
towards the maintenance of protocols

323
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,399
it's important to understand

324
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,320
how features have been adopted which

325
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,680
ones

326
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,600
are like what extension points are

327
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,519
actually working which ones are

328
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,360
successful and

329
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,279
understanding how protocols are being

330
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,839
used helps us get a feedback into that

331
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,079
loop

332
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,040
so

333
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,480
charles eckel

334
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,440
wrote

335
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,600
a quick draft just to spark that

336
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,880
conversation and that's what we talked

337
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,120
about our last meeting um

338
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,000
is the edm find code draft

339
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,920
it summarized some of the current tools

340
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,000
that people have to talk about

341
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,240
implementation status

342
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,079
there's an implementation status section

343
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,560
of drafts that's defined that gets

344
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,040
removed before publication

345
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,680
um so that's one way people can approach

346
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,519
this problem

347
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,040
and some working groups use it some

348
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,120
don't

349
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,079
you have github repos and wikis to track

350
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,240
implementation status and of course

351
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,800
there's iatf hackathon events and

352
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,480
associated wikis and those are all very

353
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,959
successful

354
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,320
but part of the problem is that this is

355
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,160
not

356
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,320
necessarily very discoverable

357
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,880
and there's a lot of variety and so

358
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,320
we're wondering if there are ways to

359
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,839
help

360
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,519
working groups that want to do this type

361
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,800
of thing

362
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,279
have a really easy way to

363
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,440
start doing this and

364
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
get their

365
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,880
draft authors and implementers involved

366
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,399
so some of the ideas the draft puts

367
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,680
forward

368
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,600
is that you could have essentially links

369
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,120
to your running code or implementation

370
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,839
status or interop test matrix

371
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,560
that you can get too easily

372
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,800
from places like your data tracker or

373
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
from your working group github or even

374
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,880
through the metadata that's associated

375
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,079
with drafts and rfcs

376
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,399
so in order to understand what would be

377
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,560
useful here the first thing we've done

378
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,440
is uh send out a survey

379
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,639
to all the working group chairs to

380
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,040
understand what's currently being done

381
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,560
so here's just a little example of some

382
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,720
of the stuff we're asking

383
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,040
this was sent out i think a week and a

384
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,800
half for two weeks ago we've had some

385
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,920
responses

386
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,600
if you are here and you are a working

387
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,800
group chair

388
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,320
and you have not filled out the survey

389
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,680
yet

390
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,120
please look at your email and fill out

391
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,560
the survey we'd love to hear from you

392
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,720
so we'll talk about this at our next

393
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,240
actual meeting

394
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,079
but just some of the initial

395
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,320
stats when i looked at this earlier this

396
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,600
week

397
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
you know most of the working groups

398
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,120
slightly over half are tracking

399
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,000
implementation status in some way

400
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,120
i think we definitely see different

401
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,440
trends in different areas of the ietf

402
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,639
and the methods are inconsistent

403
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,320
but almost all of the working group

404
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,680
chairs said that they would like to have

405
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,360
the information about their

406
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,560
implementation status be more

407
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,800
discoverable for people who are coming

408
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,480
into their working groups

409
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,920
and most of them also express that they

410
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,199
would like to be able to track this

411
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,600
implementation status in a consistent

412
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,680
way after rfc publication which is

413
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,839
something that the current

414
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,079
guidance around an implementation status

415
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,480
section of a draft does not provide

416
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,240
so i think there's interesting stuff to

417
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,399
discuss here and we'll be discussing

418
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,639
this more at our next meeting amongst

419
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,040
other topics and we'll probably report

420
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,360
back to iab open as well

421
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,560
so if there are any questions or

422
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,279
thoughts love to hear them

423
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,279
pete

424
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,199
am i here yes i am here yay

425
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,800
um uh first first hooray yes this is

426
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,880
great thank you this is this is

427
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,399
absolutely brilliant

428
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,519
um

429
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,759
i wonder how much

430
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,480
the um iesg has talked to you about this

431
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,880
and whether this could be folded into

432
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,600
the moving along the standards track

433
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,639
stuff that we've done a lousy job with

434
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,519
for i can't remember how many years

435
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,639
um

436
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,160
and this seems like it would fold in

437
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,880
brilliantly and if it became sort of

438
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,000
something that

439
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,399
working groups just did it would make

440
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,399
that whole question much easier

441
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,120
yeah i i think you know the isg is aware

442
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,560
of this topic but

443
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,680
we're definitely going to be talking to

444
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,279
them more especially as we get some

445
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,199
feedback here can you elaborate just a

446
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,320
little bit more on

447
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,160
how how are you imagining that could

448
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,720
work just so i understand

449
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,000
so i i mean ideal world my my thought

450
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,040
would be

451
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,320
um

452
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,079
you know all working groups would just

453
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,320
sort of do this as a matter of course it

454
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,160
would be the thing you do when you're

455
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,480
working on something you put it into the

456
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,759
implementation pipeline at that point

457
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,560
you know we used to have this just

458
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,360
horrible time convincing people to move

459
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,720
things along the standards track which

460
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,880
is why we went you know got rid of draft

461
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
standard um

462
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,639
this to me just

463
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,959
and and people still are not great about

464
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,199
moving things to full standard if this

465
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,160
was just widespread people would i think

466
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,920
sort of fall into it and say oh sure

467
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,000
yeah if we've got all the data to show

468
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,799
that we're widely deployed and and

469
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,760
you know implementations are

470
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
interoperable they would just do it and

471
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,679
we'd have a lot more stuff

472
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,199
get into standard

473
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,000
yep yeah totally and it would also

474
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,760
and it would also reduce the temptation

475
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,000
to stay at proposed standard forever and

476
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
have the entire internet run on proposed

477
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,119
standard um which kind of

478
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,520
sort of reduces the utility of calling

479
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
things standards in the first place so

480
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,120
this all seems great

481
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,559
yeah yeah and you know certainly i think

482
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,960
we can have the view that

483
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,039
okay the yeah the label between proposed

484
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,400
standard and standard you know i've

485
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,840
heard it expressed that yeah that's just

486
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,919
kind of a vanity label but

487
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,679
exactly it actually means something and

488
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,200
be related to

489
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,720
the fact that we know

490
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,960
that this actually is being used could

491
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,840
make it more meaningful again

492
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,320
yeah thank you so yay team 18.

493
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,200
right any other questions or thoughts

494
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,120
and i see that

495
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,320
charles has dropped the link to the

496
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,720
survey in so anyone who wants to fill

497
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,679
that out fill it out

498
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,799
all right thank you all

499
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,760
thanks tommy

500
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,000
uh and then we go to wii u

501
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,760
do you want to join us here

502
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,880
you got my name wrong so you know

503
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,440
a little bit of luck

504
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,760
um do you want to request sharing

505
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,559
yeah

506
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,590
one sec

[Music]

509
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,120
i naturally closed the um

510
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,400
the viewer right as the raise i guess

511
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,200
you can use this um share preloaded

512
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,880
slides button right next to the hint

513
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,720
button and that will just give you the

514
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,160
slides from the data tracker but you

515
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,640
have to press it yourself

516
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,590
it's true

517
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,649
[Music]

518
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,840
we don't see mine

519
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,280
under your name you have the joint

520
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,039
button and then there is this kind of

521
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,600
page thing

522
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,160
let's do it that was the other button

523
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,840
but you can also use that one

524
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,760
all right you see those

525
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,480
[Music]

526
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,039
see the slides i assume okay

527
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,400
uh so i'm going to talk about the ib

528
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,000
workshop for measuring network quality

529
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,240
for end users which we just held we had

530
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240
three chairs for it a very large program

531
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,919
committee and as you'll see in a minute

532
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:06,880
a

533
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,360
large quantity of participation too

534
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,880
which was awesome

535
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,480
uh so a little bit of background you

536
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,559
know the world connectivity has gotten

537
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,720
much much better i think you know the

538
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,640
the prevalence of increased bandwidth

539
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,880
everywhere has been fantastic we

540
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,799
actually now can do video chats that was

541
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,760
not possible just a few short years ago

542
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,360
um but you know everybody still

543
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,600
experiences local outages and issues

544
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,400
that

545
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,799
that cause issues as myriad noted

546
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,799
earlier she had sort of connectivity

547
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,480
issues earlier in this this meeting

548
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,440
alone

549
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,280
um and certainly we all have those at

550
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,240
times

551
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,600
and you know there's a lot of inner

552
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,159
application resource competition too uh

553
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,480
there's there was video uh discussions i

554
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,960
think in map rg this week about

555
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,760
what happens when multiple video streams

556
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,919
are trying to compete for uh for

557
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,200
competition and which one wins and uh

558
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,559
examining the differences between

559
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,559
different platforms you know

560
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,880
they're not all equal so

561
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,960
the goal was you know what what how can

562
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,840
we identify problem spaces in this area

563
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,840
what what is a good user experience

564
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,679
users often don't know this themselves

565
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,679
and and if if users don't know how can

566
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,880
we measure it

567
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,720
and then how can we communicate these

568
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,400
measurements uh can we do it in a

569
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,480
standardized way and

570
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,320
are there measurements that we can

571
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,559
do that users can actually understand or

572
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,640
at least be able to report other than

573
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,679
some things were not working

574
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,400
the

575
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,039
this is a graph from uh david reed who

576
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,240
attended the

577
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,000
the workshop and presented this slide

578
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,159
and was one of many fantastic

579
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,039
presentations that shows the fcc's

580
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,600
longitudinal trend for you know

581
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,760
load over data cable over over time and

582
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,919
you can see that it's getting uh better

583
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,760
so there's latency on the left-hand side

584
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,600
and latency is just generally decreasing

585
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,200
over time

586
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,880
which is fantastic that's kind of one of

587
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,520
the metrics that we want to see

588
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,200
but still

589
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,240
this is from lucas pardue who who had

590
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,159
you know when you start thinking about

591
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,640
where the problems are right there's

592
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
there's a huge number of potential

593
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,400
problems including one of the ones that

594
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,080
was discussed a lot during the workshop

595
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,760
because it was humorous and because it

596
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,320
was a good um a good example of you know

597
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
my mom was microwaving a potato and it

598
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,159
caused you know the wi-fi connection to

599
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,679
go bad

600
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,280
and you know you can imagine trying to

601
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,880
get those predicted by the average end

602
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,280
user as to what exactly is causing the

603
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,799
problem all they know is something's not

604
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,400
working they don't necessarily know why

605
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,880
so we held a workshop on this on

606
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,039
september 14th to the 16th we hold it on

607
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,320
webex and we had three days and it was

608
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,760
four hours a day

609
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,240
and there was an hour set aside you know

610
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,360
or um plus there was an hour afterwards

611
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,960
where people just hung out afterwards

612
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
and and talked for an additional hours

613
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,520
beyond just the the four hours a day so

614
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,600
it was it was neat that we had some side

615
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,520
channel discussions and breakout rooms

616
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,960
happen as well

617
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,880
there was 90 different attendees total

618
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,320
when i finally looked at the logs and

619
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,640
counted them all when we were taking

620
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,240
notes we noted that there was at least

621
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,799
76 at one particular time but at least

622
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,799
90 different people participated over

623
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,360
the course of of the three days uh which

624
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,960
is a fair amount for a workshop that's

625
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
not a that's that's a fairly large ieb

626
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,480
workshop and certainly if we held it in

627
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,720
a physical in a physical room that

628
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,559
couldn't have happened so there's some

629
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,480
benefit to virtual meetings because you

630
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,720
can actually certainly take in a lot

631
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,480
more people

632
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
uh every the way that we had structured

633
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,000
the workshop between the chairs and the

634
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,600
program community is we had three to

635
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,760
four five minute presentations with

636
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,240
clarifying questions afterwards and then

637
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,320
we allowed for a lot of discussion time

638
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,840
and that format seemed to really work

639
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,640
well

640
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,880
the discussion times were were never

641
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,480
blank there was always you know people

642
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,840
wanting to talk and discuss things

643
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,279
so we aimed for discussion and that

644
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,760
worked quite well

645
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,559
we broke the workshop down into details

646
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,600
so after reviewing a lot of the short

647
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,440
papers that were submitted

648
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,039
we realized that they sort of broke into

649
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,559
a number of categories so we had

650
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,600
introduction and background

651
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,360
presentations about you know where are

652
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,440
we today or you know what's what's the

653
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,840
current status and and how does what

654
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,279
metrics uh

655
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,520
you know are being used today followed

656
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,400
by

657
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
considerations of what metrics you know

658
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,840
we should actually be

659
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,360
thinking about or concentrating on or

660
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,559
what's broken with current ones and

661
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,760
things like that

662
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,440
and there's a lot of discussion around

663
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,559
cross layer in other words how do

664
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,320
you know multiple things interact and

665
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,480
there's there's multiple aspects of of

666
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,720
cross layer which i i think i have a

667
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,919
little bit more detail on the later

668
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,480
slide but consider wireless versus wired

669
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,640
consider you know multiple layers of of

670
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,279
the osi stack and all of these types of

671
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,200
things it's that's one of the things

672
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,440
that makes it hard right is you you need

673
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,520
to be able to measure stuff you know not

674
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,080
just at one place because that's not the

675
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,760
only place if anybody's ever studied

676
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,120
ping or trace route you know they're

677
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,559
very different applications and even

678
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,679
traceroute which has a lot more

679
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,679
information does not tell you exactly

680
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,159
where the problem is on the path

681
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,240
and then finally a synthesis of people

682
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,000
that were offering sort of bigger

683
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,559
solutions or or more global views was

684
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,159
sort of the concluding

685
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,320
of the four sections and then we

686
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,039
we did offer a a conclusion discussion

687
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,880
at the very last hour which i'll go over

688
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,679
next but uh so the goal was to to go

689
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,000
from you know background to thinking

690
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,520
through you know

691
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,600
sort of solutions as the workshop

692
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,679
progressed

693
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,720
so we took 30 minutes at the end to

694
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,480
allow people and this was sort of an

695
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,960
experiment that i i kind of came up with

696
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,200
to allow people to

697
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
uh just make statements that they

698
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,120
thought everybody might agree with right

699
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,960
what were conclusions that kind of came

700
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,559
out of all of the discussions over the

701
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,320
course of three days

702
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,919
uh that people thought were were

703
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,200
statements that everybody else would

704
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,279
stand up behind and so 24 sentences were

705
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,279
written down and we asked clarifying

706
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,960
questions about them only as this was

707
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,480
going on and then we took another 30

708
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,840
minutes to you know where people could

709
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,200
actually say wait a minute i disagree

710
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,480
with that one that one's not under

711
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,000
consensus

712
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,919
after that we actually only eliminated

713
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,000
five is really not achieving consensus

714
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,400
consensus out of 24 which um that ratio

715
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,720
to me surprised me um as as we know in

716
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,039
the atf we like to debate uh

717
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,679
everything right but so you know a good

718
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,600
percentage of them actually came out is

719
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,279
generally accepted

720
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,720
and then i later grouped them and

721
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,679
documented into the internet draft

722
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,000
so you can go read them i edited them a

723
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,600
bit for context and added more

724
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,120
information some of them were shorter

725
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,360
and you know they were

726
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,720
really well understood by people that

727
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,559
attended the group more than anything

728
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,679
else

729
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,440
so i'm going to go over them in general

730
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,200
and i group them into a number of

731
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,480
different

732
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,039
sections and i added bold words where i

733
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,720
think you know you might find the most

734
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,400
interesting you know points coming

735
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,080
around one of the nice things that kind

736
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,919
of came out is a number of short term

737
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,039
statements

738
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,480
uh that

739
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,080
that i think describe the state of of

740
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,400
network quality today right bandwidth is

741
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,600
necessary but not alone sufficient

742
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,039
one of the things that i think has been

743
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,960
pushed heavily i should say the workshop

744
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,400
really thought has been pushed heavily

745
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
in the past decade has been we just need

746
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,919
more speed more speed more speed and

747
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,159
that's that's not sufficient and that's

748
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,640
not you know alone what you need

749
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,080
i think gamers know that well that they

750
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,080
need better bandwidth and better latency

751
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,919
and game gaming was talked about a lot

752
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,360
because it's a

753
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,840
low latency desired application

754
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,520
so you really need better bandwidth

755
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,760
right you need you know not just more

756
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,279
bandwidth but you need better bandwidth

757
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,240
how can we make it better and

758
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,919
in order to really figure out if that's

759
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,240
working you need both active and passive

760
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,840
measurements you need the ability to do

761
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,120
pings and trace routes and things like

762
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,799
that that i just mentioned but you also

763
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,840
need to be able to do passive

764
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,200
measurements and how much bandwidth is

765
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,640
going by or

766
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,520
you know what sort of applications are

767
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,600
using data across the network and and

768
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,760
how can i use what i see in order to

769
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,520
measure it

770
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,760
but even active and path measurements

771
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,919
aren't useful if you can't compare

772
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,440
things over time

773
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,399
so you need archivable and queryable

774
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,320
metrics as well so that you can look at

775
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,159
trends over time like the graph that i

776
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,600
showed previously

777
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,440
you know you need to be able to to see a

778
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,960
retrending right direction or what's

779
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,559
getting worse

780
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,559
i think anybody studying academic papers

781
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,320
knows that you know longitudinal papers

782
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,520
are often the most interesting because

783
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,399
they really show trends over time

784
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,440
um

785
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,880
but a meaningful metric for users is

786
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
is this network going to work for me

787
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,799
will my application the thing that i

788
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,760
want to do is it going to work

789
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,480
and

790
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,320
and this is where we get down to how do

791
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,240
you measure stuff for end users in a way

792
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,559
that they will understand and you know

793
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,080
quite frequently it's does my

794
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,159
application work or is my network

795
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,000
insufficient do i you know do i have the

796
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,440
right sufficient characteristics in a

797
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,960
network or not

798
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,320
um and

799
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,480
one of the other important takeaways is

800
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,120
measurements are useless if you don't

801
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,880
actually make change if you don't

802
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,880
incentivize goodness

803
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,200
right so metrics that are measured

804
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,799
should be actionable can we make

805
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,440
decisions based on measurements

806
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,200
and are they you know are they

807
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,559
actionable to the point where we can

808
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,000
improve things

809
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,480
or make changes to a network in order to

810
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,120
to um to improve things

811
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,039
and one other thing that came out was

812
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,080
you know

813
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
we in the ietf and and of course in the

814
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,520
ib workshops

815
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,360
the the goal should be to benefit all

816
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,200
end users and just

817
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,760
segmenting a a

818
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,320
solution into something that is just for

819
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,640
a small section of the internet is

820
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,799
not exactly ideal right we should come

821
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,159
up with technologies that benefit

822
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,799
everyone everywhere

823
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,159
there's a bunch of more specific

824
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,440
statements and i'm not going to read

825
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,039
each one of these quite as much as i did

826
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,880
the generals but

827
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,880
one metric that was thrown around a lot

828
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,960
is round trips per minute it's a useful

829
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,960
and consumable metric i think on the

830
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,720
server side that's been used for a long

831
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,640
time but it's also useful on the on the

832
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,200
user side as well of of how many

833
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,360
transactions can i can i do or something

834
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,039
like that per minute

835
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,559
but it's you know you need to consider

836
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,440
the full communication path from client

837
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,840
to server and back and you know how many

838
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,159
times can you can you do that cycle it's

839
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,840
not just a one-way trip for example

840
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,919
um

841
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,840
applications you know are really needed

842
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,080
that are new that can report good

843
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,919
measurements in order to identify

844
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,240
insufficient points in network access

845
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,240
so this is this is i think one of the

846
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,600
largest things that we're missing today

847
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,399
is i know that my my network is broken i

848
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,919
know that

849
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,919
my somebody on the other side has taken

850
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,440
a measurement of my video quality and my

851
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,559
audio quality and uh you know and told

852
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,720
me that it's not good right and which

853
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,080
reminds me i hope that it's still good

854
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,200
because i could just be talking to

855
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,440
myself i have no way of knowing right i

856
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,880
have no way of actually understanding

857
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,559
whether my

858
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,399
my video and audio is actually getting

859
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,640
out okay uh until somebody interrupts me

860
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,159
to say no no you're still good or nods

861
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,360
their head or something like that like

862
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,039
you get in a room

863
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,159
um

864
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,120
and so we you know we need better

865
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,880
things that can actually identify

866
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,880
problem points across the whole

867
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,880
you know network from from one point to

868
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,480
another or more likely you know these

869
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,080
days you're actually having network

870
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,679
applications that are reaching out to a

871
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,440
lot of different places and where is the

872
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,480
exact

873
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
javascript being pulled down to a web

874
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,679
page that's actually breaking that i

875
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,200
can't get to that little piece as

876
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,039
opposed to everything else that actually

877
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,200
is loading properly

878
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,880
so we need you know simple metrics and

879
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,600
we need metrics per application which

880
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,919
users are able to consume and report you

881
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,600
know issues about what is working and

882
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,080
what is not um i was noticing when i was

883
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,000
looking at the data tracker earlier that

884
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,399
that you know i had to click submit and

885
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,640
i didn't get any feedback that that my

886
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,480
submit actually went through right i had

887
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,919
no notion of of yes it is taking a bit

888
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,919
it is loading because it is loading in

889
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,080
the background and so that's to me i

890
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,360
wasn't sure if it was my network i

891
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,640
wasn't sure if it was the server i

892
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,840
wasn't sure if it was the the

893
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,120
application

894
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,240
um

895
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,279
one of the other things that we talked

896
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,120
about a lot is the differences between

897
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,640
quality of service versus quality of

898
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,360
experience uh so you know there's those

899
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,799
are thrown around quite a bit but um

900
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,320
they're they're

901
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,519
they are they are sort of the

902
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,880
quintessential things of how do we

903
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,399
measure quality of service and how do we

904
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,840
measure quality of experience and

905
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,360
they're not quite equal right how do we

906
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,600
measure what the user is actually doing

907
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,919
or experiencing

908
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,279
we also looked at some problem

909
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,760
statements and concerns so

910
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,320
some of the statements that were made

911
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,760
during the conclusion section were

912
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,120
related to

913
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,960
uh things that we

914
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,279
we had issues with um latency mean and

915
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,120
medians or distractions

916
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,279
is one um you know the interesting thing

917
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,200
is if you i think most people know that

918
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,720
if you look at gaussian curves or all

919
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,519
sorts of other you know metrics for

920
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,120
trying to determine

921
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,519
uh you know some statistical average

922
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,279
about something that if you just look at

923
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,480
the mean in the median you're missing a

924
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,000
whole lot of information right a mean

925
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,840
and a median can be great but the

926
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,760
standard deviation is so large that you

927
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,360
know you end up with a lot of brokenness

928
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,279
well beyond the mean and median for just

929
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,120
as an example

930
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,600
um and the second bullet there is

931
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,039
actually kind of similar to some some

932
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,960
things that we said before some of these

933
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,399
statements actually did have a lot of

934
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,720
overlap but it's frustrating that you

935
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,559
know if you can only measure stuff but

936
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,559
you can't simultaneously improve them

937
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,080
right we should be able to improve them

938
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,360
as well

939
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,760
and we need to figure out a way to

940
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,240
motivate those improvements right so we

941
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,159
need to come up with incentives for

942
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,840
public network access

943
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,600
uh that will motivate them and again

944
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,840
this is similar to you know if if you

945
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,840
just measure it then that's not uh

946
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,519
that's not very helpful

947
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,880
and there was some discussion about the

948
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,279
ecological impact of you know one

949
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,039
interesting aspect of measuring network

950
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,880
quality is not just how well it works

951
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,320
but how well it's damaging the

952
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
environment or how how well

953
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,080
um everything is

954
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,279
in the long run we could have great

955
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,200
networks that you do lots of bitcoin

956
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,279
mining that's fantastic but you know is

957
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,039
that is that a long-term

958
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,960
uh goal or will it actually you know

959
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
cause later issues that will

960
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,640
eventually erode our networks for

961
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,000
example

962
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,279
um

963
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,360
and you know there's there's not

964
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,240
evidence that any single metric is more

965
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,760
important than others and one of the

966
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,918
hard things that i i don't think that

967
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,119
the workshop came to a complete

968
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,800
conclusion about is

969
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
how do you do prioritization across

970
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,159
multiple metrics how do you find the

971
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,079
right metric for the right time

972
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,839
for the right component of a um

973
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,918
of a network right how do you know

974
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,000
there's not anyone that is perfect and

975
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,440
some are better than others and how do

976
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,839
you uh manage to put them all into one

977
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,760
situation or one evaluation and get a

978
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,719
concrete solution out of it

979
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,040
so in terms of future work we want to

980
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,440
document the the workshop um the draft

981
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,918
ieb and that is the

982
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,000
uh that acronym is yet horrible but i

983
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,520
figure we're good at horrible acronyms

984
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,119
so i just included but it's measuring

985
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,560
network quality for end users because it

986
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,000
was too long to fit in the draft name so

987
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,320
i shortened it to an acronym that

988
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,079
i don't think had been used until i put

989
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,520
it into the draft

990
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,440
uh it is in the um ieb

991
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,599
the internet architecture github

992
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,079
repository people are welcome to do it

993
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,480
there is the url that takes you to the

994
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,440
workshop itself all of the workshop

995
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,160
discussions were actually held in uh on

996
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,000
recorded videos so they're all in

997
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,240
youtube and there's links to them as

998
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,560
well as all of the papers from that that

999
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,839
link

1000
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,280
it was fascinating to listen to it in

1001
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,720
fact i still want to go back and

1002
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,079
re-watch it all before we finish

1003
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,560
publishing the entire report

1004
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,480
and then there's discussions about where

1005
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,640
to go next right so we need to bring the

1006
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,839
work forward uh there is some tasks that

1007
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,079
likely can be delegated to existing atf

1008
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,599
working groups if there's immediate work

1009
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,520
to be done and there was general you

1010
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,599
know interest in where do we take longer

1011
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,960
term stuff and i think that the the

1012
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,240
takeout is really we should take

1013
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,800
research tests to the irtf uh there was

1014
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,240
a little bit of discussion of do we need

1015
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,480
an ieb program for this um i think the

1016
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,040
general consideration is

1017
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,800
this is probably not program worthy at

1018
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,400
this point but um

1019
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
we have a breakdown between ietf working

1020
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,560
groups and irtf uh research groups that

1021
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,359
were

1022
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,359
uh we're probably okay so

1023
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,000
that is it for slides i think i took it

1024
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,320
almost exactly ten minutes is there any

1025
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,420
questions or discussion on this

1026
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,699
[Music]

1027
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,800
yeah maybe people want to bring it to

1028
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,400
the microphone somewhat

1029
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,760
yeah

1030
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,280
i will say you know there's so much

1031
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,440
information in that workshop it was hard

1032
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,079
to um there's no way to summarize it all

1033
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,079
and there was it was a very dense

1034
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,680
working workshop

1035
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,680
which was fantastic to participate in

1036
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,440
but i was you know looking at writing

1037
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,280
the draft going i don't even know how to

1038
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,320
summarize all that so

1039
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,480
yeah i think the the discussion in the

1040
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,079
chat is is actually a little bit about

1041
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,640
metrics and there's also a draft in iqp

1042
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,359
i'm talking about 100 times per minute

1043
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,160
as a different metric to use for example

1044
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,599
um i guess there was also a lot of

1045
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,200
discussion at the workshop about matrix

1046
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,320
right

1047
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,640
yeah i mean to throw out the ippm

1048
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,720
working group is the most likely place

1049
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,280
for for follow-on work to go but

1050
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,200
trying to be generic and not pigeon hole

1051
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,839
exactly there

1052
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,660
okay

1053
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,440
[Music]

1054
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,200
in that case i will turn it back to you

1055
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,839
guys i think

1056
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,440
yeah i mean

1057
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,040
people can still join the queue if they

1058
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,000
want to

1059
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,520
have more discussion because that's why

1060
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,119
we're here

1061
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,960
we don't have any other agenda item we

1062
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,440
have the usual mic spot so people can

1063
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,040
also just join the queue for any other

1064
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,480
questions they have to the iap if they

1065
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,720
want to

1066
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,359
and maybe to um i mean we we have the

1067
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,760
technical plenary which was already um

1068
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,960
last week

1069
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,359
and usually in the not in the technical

1070
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,040
so we had the administration and then

1071
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,960
last week already so usually we try to

1072
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,920
concentrate on more of the

1073
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,560
administrative questions at that plenary

1074
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,839
um so this this open mic is really more

1075
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,480
for technical questions

1076
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,400
based on any kind of workshop any kind

1077
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,240
of documents working on workshops or

1078
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,400
programs or even if you want to erase

1079
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,079
the topic that you think the ib should

1080
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,760
be aware of that's your chance

1081
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,839
and we have martin

1082
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,200
i just want to um say what i said in the

1083
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,839
chat which put in a plug for ippm next

1084
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,400
session which is going to have a draft

1085
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,640
about rpm

1086
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,000
okay i mean if there if there's nobody

1087
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,680
who wants to speak up has any questions

1088
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,359
or any comments we can actually close

1089
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,720
the session here but i'm feeling a

1090
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,160
little bit bad if i would close the

1091
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,440
session now while they're still

1092
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,839
discussing going in the chat

1093
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:12,880
um

1094
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,000
so i give you a few more minutes to

1095
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,359
take the chance and speak up in the mic

1096
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,959
charles

1097
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,960
yeah i had a quick question for uh

1098
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,880
actually for tommy on the survey is

1099
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,920
there a

1100
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,839
deadline or perhaps we should set a

1101
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,079
deadline for when responses are

1102
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,760
requested there so people know if that's

1103
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,200
something we need to kind of quickly do

1104
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,560
this week or

1105
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,079
i think we'll get more responses if we

1106
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,079
put a deadline in everyone's bedroom

1107
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,599
yeah gotten a fair amount of responses

1108
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,000
um i have been pretty happy with that so

1109
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,200
far

1110
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,720
i'm hoping that you know this reminder

1111
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,040
and maybe i'll send a ping to the list

1112
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,520
uh today just to tell people hey

1113
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,119
here's the link again

1114
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,880
go fill it out

1115
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,839
but

1116
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,839
i i imagine after

1117
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,359
just kind of naturally after like a week

1118
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,119
or so anyone who's going to respond will

1119
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,800
respond um

1120
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,319
something else

1121
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,000
but

1122
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,720
yeah probably you know by

1123
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,920
you know

1124
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,839
certainly by december i'll just say okay

1125
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,359
here's the results and we'll go look at

1126
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,599
it as a program

1127
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,520
okay and then uh you know one other

1128
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,200
thing i put in the chat just kind of

1129
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
more of a comment is

1130
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,040
you know my personal interest with the

1131
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,680
fine code draft is also a bit broader

1132
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,440
than implementation

1133
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,079
uh status and funding yeah the

1134
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,160
interoperability aspect which is super

1135
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,480
important and i think a goal

1136
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,720
as well but i'm also very interested in

1137
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,480
just any code related to it like some of

1138
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,520
the code that we've done in the

1139
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,680
hackathon and it kind of helps you with

1140
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,280
understanding a protocol or maybe

1141
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,960
implementing it or

1142
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,760
or viewing traffic on the network or you

1143
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,440
know any kind of test tools those types

1144
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,839
of things too are super helpful just to

1145
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,240
get people help people to um to

1146
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,839
implement some of the standards that

1147
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:12,960
we're

1148
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,040
um specifying in these drafts so i'd be

1149
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,880
interested in that as well

1150
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,160
yep

1151
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,399
thank you

1152
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,439
and we have spent any queue

1153
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,839
um

1154
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:36,880
i wanted to thank the uh

1155
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,079
the iab for doing the uh

1156
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,200
public

1157
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,040
viewing of it uh of iab meetings

1158
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,480
uh and for one specific reason

1159
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,400
which was

1160
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,079
the iab has been doing

1161
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,359
reviews of research groups uh on an

1162
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,240
ongoing basis for as long as i as long

1163
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,040
as i have known about

1164
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,520
and they have not tended to be very

1165
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,960
public

1166
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,480
i had the opportunity to

1167
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,520
watch

1168
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,520
not participate in but watch the pan rg

1169
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,440
review that the iab did fairly recently

1170
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,440
and having that be bented and

1171
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,920
viewable as you know as it was happening

1172
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,119
and things like that was super uh useful

1173
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,760
for me and i i

1174
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,040
hope other

1175
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,920
uh research group participants will take

1176
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,560
advantage of that when the iab is uh

1177
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,079
reviewing review their research groups

1178
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,319
but thank you all for doing that thank

1179
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,240
you for the feedback so um yeah you're

1180
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,640
right that these reviews haven't been um

1181
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,720
that much public because usually we used

1182
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,359
to do them during the meeting week um in

1183
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,200
one of our breakfast meetings and those

1184
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,280
are i'm not as public as our calls

1185
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,280
usually are and given the circumstances

1186
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,200
we now have integrated them into our

1187
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,200
frequent calls so we can schedule them

1188
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,200
anytime and those calls are actually

1189
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,520
open for observers and so you can join

1190
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,960
any any ib call in listening

1191
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,640
rust if you want to editing or are you

1192
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,480
just here to say goodbye

1193
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,000
no i think i'm good i would encourage

1194
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,760
people to join the ib

1195
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,920
that the calls that they can join other

1196
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,480
than executive sessions as an observer

1197
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,839
we have a lot of good technical stuff

1198
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,240
going on right now and uh we actually

1199
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,760
have a lot of drafts and stuff we could

1200
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,400
use help with

1201
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,119
yeah i mean um

1202
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,440
check out the ib webpage and try to find

1203
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,280
the agenda there it's there's actually a

1204
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,720
direct link on the front page on the on

1205
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,079
the right side

1206
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,240
um and you can see that we not only have

1207
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,160
those boring iap calls where we talk

1208
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,079
about administrative matters we now have

1209
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,440
actually calls that we label as

1210
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,119
technical discussions where we only

1211
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,800
discuss one technical topic so this

1212
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,720
could be interesting for you as well

1213
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,119
um if you want to check out but also as

1214
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,800
you just said documents i just want to

1215
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,040
remind people please review the passing

1216
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,480
this document which where we have the

1217
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,440
call for feedback um out there right now

1218
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,280
and and and

1219
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,720
check out the other work we are doing in

1220
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,560
the programs and now we have more people

1221
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,680
in the queue so robin is next

1222
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,079
i think we heard you already if you say

1223
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,359
something

1224
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,880
okay uh in fact i my this the

1225
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,960
my some this the

1226
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,960
one who has some of these comments on

1227
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,839
this is the draft that's the past signal

1228
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,920
yeah because you know that's the this

1229
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,640
time we have this the the evening work

1230
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,440
and we propose that's the solution

1231
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,280
that inca

1232
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,880
including the

1233
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,359
data plane encapsulation and also this

1234
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,240
is the

1235
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,640
uh control plane and this is the young

1236
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,040
model for this work so this will be

1237
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,000
helpful to understand this one yeah but

1238
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,599
you know that's the

1239
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,599
from my point of view so you'll notice

1240
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,359
there's also

1241
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,480
also there's the discussion about the

1242
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,440
open internet and the limited domain

1243
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,560
and according to our this the discussion

1244
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,400
about this the

1245
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,760
epm work so we kind of feel this uh so

1246
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,920
we we can feel this that possible

1247
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,119
difference even for this the past signal

1248
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,760
and also the ep work it seems

1249
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,480
uh

1250
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,800
similar that's the

1251
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,839
application and the networking that's

1252
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:36,800
this

1253
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,079
integration but you know that for the

1254
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,319
for the apm worker that is the limited

1255
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:45,680
domain so you can use only use available

1256
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,400
this is the package header information

1257
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,920
to map to some of this the api id

1258
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,560
but you notice if this is a pass signal

1259
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,440
so this is maybe that means this the

1260
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,720
signal information be directly derived

1261
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,400
as the host and the application that is

1262
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,280
maybe more specific because it's very

1263
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,000
clear about what's the user and what's

1264
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,599
the application

1265
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,920
so from my point of view so that when

1266
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,280
for this the

1267
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,520
for this drop from my point of view you

1268
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,319
to

1269
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,359
uh

1270
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,520
you should be thinking about the

1271
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,599
possible difference between the open

1272
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,359
internet and the limited domain

1273
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,200
so um if you remember i think at the

1274
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,440
last ieb open meeting we actually had a

1275
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,200
presentation about this draft and we had

1276
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,040
a bit of discussion there and got a lot

1277
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,640
of input that was really good and i

1278
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,200
think a similar comment was made um so

1279
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,800
the last revision of this draft we

1280
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,520
actually updated it to add a little bit

1281
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,119
more text about this

1282
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,880
um you you should probably just read it

1283
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,440
yourself but i think the considerations

1284
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,880
i personally think and i'm an author of

1285
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,440
that draft um i think the considerations

1286
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,640
are not that different for limited

1287
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,720
domains you need security also limited

1288
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,680
domains you have to protect um about you

1289
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,440
know unknown attackers that attack your

1290
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,280
network so i don't think there's a huge

1291
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,400
difference

1292
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,680
and that's what we're mentioning in the

1293
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,680
draft but i mean please have a look and

1294
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,760
provide more feedback and start a

1295
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,680
discussion on the architecture discuss

1296
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,480
mailing list i think

1297
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,160
okay

1298
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,359
thank you

1299
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,598
wes

1300
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,599
thanks i just wanted to follow on a

1301
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,160
little bit about russ's great comment of

1302
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,480
the iab meetings are all open um except

1303
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,839
for executive session and that's the

1304
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,000
part that i wanted to talk about we have

1305
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,760
almost nothing in executive session and

1306
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,359
i know i talked to somebody a year or

1307
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,599
two ago that thought you know we always

1308
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,280
go straight into executive session and

1309
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,760
that is that is we spent like maybe five

1310
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,240
minutes and it's only when we're looking

1311
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,240
at background information for people

1312
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,480
we're going to appoint or comments that

1313
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,400
you know when we collect public feedback

1314
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,440
that is about it we're we've actually

1315
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,280
had almost no executive sessions for the

1316
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,160
past

1317
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,400
three years that i've been in the aba

1318
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,160
yeah i can assure you that if you if

1319
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,680
you're missing the executive fashion

1320
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,680
you're only missing the boring stuff so

1321
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,520
no worries there

1322
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,000
spencer again

1323
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,440
i don't think you're supposed to say

1324
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,160
that in front of the uh iab members and

1325
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,119
potential iab uh nominees

1326
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:18,400
but

1327
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,400
but it is true um

1328
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,800
the uh

1329
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,160
the question i was going to ask is

1330
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,760
probably uh

1331
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,319
for something that russ was

1332
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,960
mentioning about uh

1333
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,359
having documents that the iab would like

1334
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:34,880
to have help on

1335
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,680
and um

1336
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,200
i i'm a little curious about uh two

1337
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,880
things one is kind of

1338
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,920
uh how we would know that

1339
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,040
and number two is is there a is there an

1340
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,760
obvious time for us to

1341
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,599
try to be helpful

1342
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,200
uh

1343
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,440
you know like often the often the

1344
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,680
notices i will see are

1345
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,040
uh

1346
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,040
for ib call for comments on adoption

1347
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,359
or something like that i mean but i'm a

1348
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,040
little vague on

1349
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,319
how we

1350
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,640
how the people could who could help

1351
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,160
would know that

1352
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,359
they

1353
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,040
should be helping and should be helping

1354
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,279
now

1355
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,160
and maybe so i mean uh i think your

1356
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,599
question is really good but maybe i also

1357
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,839
want to pre-empt this so when we publish

1358
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,599
the document on the ice cream it's also

1359
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,359
kind of an opinion piece from the iob

1360
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,119
right so we were looking for a lot of

1361
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,040
input because the iab has some smart

1362
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,640
people but we don't know everything and

1363
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,079
and we don't want to miss important

1364
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,000
stuff right but at some point it's it's

1365
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,160
also um you know what the iv thinks is

1366
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,920
the right advice to the community russia

1367
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,599
wanted to say something

1368
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,920
yeah i was just going to say yeah and

1369
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,839
you know if you attended some of the

1370
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,200
technical sessions you'd see some of the

1371
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,280
stuff we were working on and maybe get

1372
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,119
involved a bit sooner than when it's

1373
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,359
published and i don't really know of

1374
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,280
another good way of

1375
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,440
um or just look at the meeting minutes

1376
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,880
from the old meeting minutes and look at

1377
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,480
some of the stuff we're working on you

1378
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,440
don't have to attend the meeting

1379
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,680
necessarily just say oh yeah i see the

1380
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,240
ib talked about blah blah blah they

1381
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,839
might be doing a document there let me

1382
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:13,839
go find out so um just from the process

1383
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,599
point of view um for a couple of years

1384
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,040
already we have two steps where we

1385
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,359
actually reach out to the explicitly

1386
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,359
reach our community one is before we

1387
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,000
adopt a document as an ib document

1388
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,079
that's what what with passing document

1389
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:27,599
is right now so this is an early stage

1390
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:28,640
and this is a really good point to

1391
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,079
provide a lot of input because that's

1392
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,319
where we can still scope and change the

1393
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,000
document and the other one is very very

1394
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,079
late just because before we um start

1395
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,680
want to publish the document so that's

1396
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,200
the point where document is basically

1397
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,680
done and if you have a concern we might

1398
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,040
still consider it but we're not planning

1399
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,720
to change the document a lot but we do

1400
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,960
have these two points in in the process

1401
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,040
where you can easily engage

1402
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,720
and between those two points or even

1403
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,480
before that first point we try to

1404
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,319
actually bring it to this meeting here

1405
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,160
because that's where we have discussion

1406
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,118
time with the community

1407
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,119
thank you all

1408
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,160
have a great ietf

1409
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,520
uh robin

1410
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,160
uh in fact you know i'm not sure that if

1411
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,319
you have this talk to

1412
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,359
the community uh about the point or not

1413
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,559
in fact i think that's the ib meeting

1414
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:21,440
that is open and now that's the

1415
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,800
every month the uh the fourth

1416
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,119
week we will have a

1417
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,200
dedicated meeting for the technical

1418
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,839
discussion we wish that the community

1419
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,960
members can bring this interest topic to

1420
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,480
the ib so that we can help to schedule

1421
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,880
this one we can have some the discussion

1422
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,359
in the ib this is the meeting open

1423
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:46,240
meeting so that's that's my suggestion

1424
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,599
okay

1425
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,280
yeah definitely if you if you have

1426
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,720
topics and that's another purpose of

1427
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,400
this meeting if you have topic that you

1428
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,640
think the iab should consider please

1429
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,118
bring it to us

1430
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,040
so and now i think we actually reached

1431
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,720
the end of the queue and we can just

1432
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,319
stop a few minutes early here i don't

1433
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:20,240
think anybody would be too sorry about

1434
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,440
that

1435
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,640
um

1436
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,119
so in that sense thank you everybody for

1437
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,040
the meeting um if you have any further

1438
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,640
