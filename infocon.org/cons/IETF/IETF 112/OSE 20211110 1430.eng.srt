26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,399
so this is our agenda for today

27
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,479
i will start with some administrative

28
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,640
and then

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,119
we'll have the document

30
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,320
status of the working group documents

31
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,799
i will spend a bit of time to discuss

32
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,960
the x509

33
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,880
i drafted

34
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,759
the

35
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,479
simpler encoding the certificates draft

36
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,760
and

37
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,319
we will hear about

38
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,720
two new drafts

39
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,680
that might be of interest

40
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,599
for the working group and we have a bit

41
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,200
of flex time at the end if there are any

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,319
other topics is there any passion of

43
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,560
this agenda

44
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,720
i'll take that as a no

45
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,560
and so

46
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,560
uh the note 12 was presented

47
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,560
the minutes can be accessed here

48
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,879
we will need a minute

49
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,760
taker or a person responsible for the

50
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,519
minutes

51
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,519
um

52
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,239
are there any volunteers

53
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,640
we

54
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,519
only need someone to

55
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,480
make sure that the action items are

56
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,879
taken

57
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,120
so

58
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,599
it shouldn't be too

59
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,319
difficult

60
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,440

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,840
uh 8152 beast alex draft

116
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,479
uh it is in hot

117
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,319
48

118
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,759
for some time the same applies to the

119
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,319
best document

120
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,600
there have been some small discussions

121
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
that needed to be completed and

122
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,000
i believe

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,520
there was a

124
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,880
suggestion

125
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,319
by

126
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,319
jorgen

127
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,560
for

128
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,639
doing a

129
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,199
small modification

130
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,560
and do you want to discuss that

131
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,720
now

132
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,160
given that everyone is around

133
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,870
[Music]

134
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,339
[Music]

135
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,240
sorry viola was that the question about

136
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,800
the biz alex or the destruct

137
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,639
uh

138
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,919
so i remember there was a deja with

139
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,080
integers

140
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,120
uh

141
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,120
i think it was

142
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,039
yeah i think this was allowing the key

143
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,800
id to be both an integer and

144
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,759
a uh byte string

145
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,440
previously it was just a byte string

146
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,919
yes

147
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,479
so there is a pr uh

148
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,080
on the uh on the struct

149
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,599
draft

150
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,680
which is doing just that adding adding

151
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,280
the int

152
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,400
and then what it was in the mail

153
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
exchange on

154
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,720
what how should we handle this

155
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,960
given that

156
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,080
the

157
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,520
draft is in a progress state

158
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,599
and i think the proposal was that we

159
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,440
should actually try to

160
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,360
make the change in the

161
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,120
document now

162
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,160
but the question is do we need to have

163
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,319
further reviews or

164
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,800
how can we

165
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,759
how do we handle this that this

166
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,640
proposed change

167
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,320
so this is

168
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,640
mike jones speaking as chair um

169
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,000
the

170
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,560
point of taking stuff to internet

171
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,080
standard from draft standard is to

172
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,120
uh

173
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,200
preserve the parts that are

174
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,120
in use without any changes

175
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,880
and

176
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,560
uh changing the format of the key id is

177
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,160
a breaking change

178
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,120
it will

179
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,480
if people use ins it will break existing

180
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,240
implementations

181
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,160
therefore i'm strongly against ever

182
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,360
doing this

183
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,920
it's unnecessary

184
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,600
we should not do this we should close

185
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,360
the pr can you

186
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,399
uh put a link to the pr in the chat

187
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,839
please and i will close it

188
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,160
[Music]

189
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,560
this goes against what best documents

190
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,240
and internet standards

191
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,040
are intended to do

192
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,760
so i'm sorry i'm a little bit busy doing

193
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,240
both the agenda and sorry the the notes

194
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,640
and and uh trying to find this link but

195
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,279
i'm on my way

196
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,519
so

197
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,279
internet standards documents we we

198
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,959
always have

199
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,640
interesting discussions because not

200
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,440
everybody actually has run through this

201
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,600
process

202
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,519
and

203
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,519
internet and its

204
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,279
a little bit over the course of the last

205
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,959
10 years

206
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,800
in the itf

207
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,440
so basically what mike said is certainly

208
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,560
true

209
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,480
on the other hand

210
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,640
having experience

211
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,680
with using a protocol can also mean that

212
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,000
you learn something

213
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,279
and i think the learning here was that

214
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,920
there are applications where

215
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,480
having a numeric key id

216
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,399
is quite useful

217
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,360
so

218
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,120
we probably wouldn't want to

219
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,279
rearrange the structure of of uh cosy

220
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,200
encrypt zero or something

221
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,640
uh at this stage that would be wrong

222
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,279
but uh doing a small fix like this

223
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,800
is well within what can be done on the

224
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,240
way from

225
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,920
a proposed standard to an internet

226
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,440
standard

227
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,560
so that's just one point i would like to

228
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
make

229
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,920
i i don't have a strong opinion on the

230
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,839
point itself

231
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,480
uh whether we need the the

232
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,040
numeric key but i'm also not working

233
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,160
with the protocols that would benefit

234
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,600
from that

235
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,920
most so i leave it to others to make

236
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,120
that point but i want to say that the

237
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,120
process argument is

238
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,800
important

239
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,839
but

240
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,600
i don't think it actually applies to

241
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,040
this particular situation

242
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,680
um

243
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,839
it remains a breaking change which is

244
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,959
something you're not allowed to do

245
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,160
during

246
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,720
the process of taking a draft standard

247
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,000
to standard

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,639
if anybody uses this it breaks all the

249
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,880
existing implementations

250
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,600
they can't parse it

251
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,079
it would mean that we have to pull

252
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,800
the draft out of

253
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,120
the rfc editor queue which is actually

254
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,279
in auth 48

255
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,120
and then return it to the working group

256
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,760
and it is not worth doing

257
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,000
furthermore

258
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,800
the arguments for

259
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,519
numeric values

260
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,360
i think

261
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,040
don't hold up because you can

262
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,720
use the same

263
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,000
byte string

264
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,920
as you would use for the numeric

265
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,240
representation

266
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,120
and at most you're

267
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,720
adding a byte to the value

268
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,519
that is not worth pulling document out

269
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,200
of the internet standard queue

270
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,240
so i just uh want to uh that there was a

271
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,320
long thread on the

272
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,079
mailing list on the cosy mailing list

273
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,279
and the

274
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,200
the conclusion was that we should make

275
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,519
this change and now it's it's always

276
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,519
good to have new input

277
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,480
on the topic but

278
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,000
this input was not provided freely

279
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,079
look i'm sorry i didn't

280
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,320
weigh in on the thread um

281
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,399
but

282
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,480
we should not be making breaking changes

283
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,320
in the internet standard process

284
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,720
[Music]

285
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,930
uh yes john and then

286
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,399
[Music]

287
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,800
and probably

288
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,320
yeah i

289
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,720
i agree with what

290
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,959
harrison said that this is something

291
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,199
that is learned from experience and

292
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,000
can very well be done in an infinite

293
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,959
standard

294
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,920
i definitely don't think this is a

295
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,120
breaking change as this is as breaking

296
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,399
as registering a new algorithm if if you

297
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,560
use that new algorithm

298
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,959
none of the old deployments

299
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,120
will be able to talk to you

300
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,240
uh so i i don't really understand why

301
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,720
this would be more breaking than

302
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,839
registering um

303
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,600
like kiran said as a bit surprised i

304
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,760
think this was discussed quite

305
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,240
long and was from support i think it was

306
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,639
an ad suggesting that

307
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,600
it was

308
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,720
best to be done already now but i i

309
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,639
definitely think it needs to be done one

310
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,120
bite actually matters i don't have a

311
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,440
strong opinion about

312
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,519
doing it now or in a separate drawing

313
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,720
um the difference between

314
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,360
adding an algorithm which

315
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,680
i understand

316
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,880
is that

317
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,199
cryptographic agility demands the

318
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,199
ability to

319
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,199
add algorithms

320
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,959
and that's

321
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,320
an expected extension point

322
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,800
changing one of the most basic data

323
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,120
structures

324
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,040
in cosi

325
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,120
is not an expected

326
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,519
change

327
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,440
and

328
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,279
again

329
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,440
you're right that if somebody uses a new

330
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,880
algorithm

331
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,199
that

332
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,519
and it's not supported by the

333
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,600
implementation that'll

334
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,920
break that implementation

335
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,000
and if somebody changes the data

336
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,240
structure

337
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,560
that will break all implementations but

338
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,480
the difference is

339
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,680
there's no expectation

340
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,079
for the basic data structures changing

341
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,000
there is an expectation for new

342
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,639
algorithms

343
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,800
and next q a

344
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,519
as the responsible ed

345
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,720
so

346
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,560
i think that we've seen a couple of

347
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,959
different perspectives uh portrayed

348
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,720
about what the

349
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,639
standards process means in going from

350
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,959
proposed standard to internet standard

351
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,639
i

352
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,759
basically agree with what karsten said

353
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,560
that

354
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,800
there is some scope for

355
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,199
discovered with the spec as it was in

356
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,040
proposed standard form

357
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,680
when we go to internet standard

358
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,000
and you know what exactly constitutes

359
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,440
such a fix

360
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,519
is something of a subjective

361
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,440
determination

362
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,039
but furthermore it's something that we

363
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,720
do need to get both working group

364
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,319
consensus on

365
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,199
and full itf consensus on

366
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,599
and so if we were to propose to make

367
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,119
this change in this document

368
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,439
i would feel a need to go through a

369
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,439
specific working group last call and i

370
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,480
believe also an itf last call

371
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,880
because as mike points out this is in

372
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,960
some sense a significant change it's not

373
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,720
something i'm comfortable

374
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,320
just doing at the last minute in all 48

375
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,039
there is the potential for

376
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,080
real

377
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,679
consequences for implementations

378
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,360
and so it would be something that we

379
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,840
need focused attention

380
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,400
on i will also mention that if we

381
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,280
do not want to make this change

382
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,960
in this document going to internet

383
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,679
standard it's also an option to have a

384
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,919
separate document that is proposed

385
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,039
standard

386
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,200
that would then update

387
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,000
the

388
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,679
internet standard to be

389
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,280
rfc

390
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,639
uh to make this change

391
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,240
and i think there was also a note in

392
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,160
the chat which maybe bob is getting up

393
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,640
to the mic to say right after me

394
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,360
about uh being able to change the when

395
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,559
you're encoding if there's also a

396
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,160
version or a feature flag that you can

397
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,760
use to get that

398
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,720
um

399
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,760
so

400
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,480
i

401
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,960
i'm hearing everything that that has

402
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,880
every point that's been raised and

403
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,440
there's valid concerns all around and so

404
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,960
this is not a

405
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,280
clear-cut decision to make

406
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,918
at least in my mind

407
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,880
and this is mike i would be fine with

408
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,240
this starting in an individual draft

409
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,840
that's separate from the internet

410
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,120
standard

411
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,520
as a proposed extension and then people

412
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,240
could adopt the extension or not

413
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,840
but this should go through the normal

414
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,160
review process this shouldn't be crammed

415
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,679
into

416
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,440
a document in auth 48

417
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,280
right i don't think anyone is saying

418
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,799
we're going to make it during off 48

419
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,240
this would be something that has to come

420
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,080
back to the working group and the itaf

421
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,480
as a whole if we choose to do it in this

422
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,760
document

423
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
okay i thought i heard people asking to

424
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,960
do that

425
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,960
maybe i misunderstood but i i i'll defer

426
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,039
it to the queue

427
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,960
okay i think that brings up bob

428
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,840
decades and i can find

429
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,960
going from proposed to standard

430
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,679
cases where important changes were made

431
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,799
because there were oops or we lack

432
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,280
something or whatever and we've had to

433
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,320
make changes and because we've fielded

434
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,400
things we've learned that we don't have

435
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,120
the flexibility we need for whatever

436
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,160
reason

437
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,640
almost always there was some versioning

438
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,280
that we could use to make so we didn't

439
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,600
break what was deployed and make

440
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,559
products

441
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,320
migrate cleanly to what is standard so

442
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,919
hopefully there is some version that we

443
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,480
can use for making this change as to

444
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,960
what uh was just mentioned in the in the

445
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,559
in by

446
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,200
dkg if we got products that don't look

447
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,360
at version before they start decoding

448
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,840
the things that's their problem uh

449
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,000
that's why we have versioning in in

450
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,760
these sorts of things so we hope we have

451
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,720
urgently

452
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,840
so uh i'll just wrap up with that that

453
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,280
at as a community we do make these sorts

454
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,679
of changes as a community that's why

455
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,080
we've learned painfully to include

456
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,080
versioning

457
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,000
uh

458
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,320
yes carton i

459
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,159
think that should be the last comment

460
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,080
and you should move on

461
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,799
yeah

462
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,960
let me just quickly point out that

463
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,880
version is not needed

464
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,000
um to allow integers in this place

465
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,080
because the sibo encoding

466
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,640
makes sure that you notice that there is

467
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,600
something there that you didn't expect

468
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,159
um so a version would probably only

469
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,000
cloud the uh issue here

470
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,919
um so the the

471
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,240
essentially the the major type in that

472
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,440
field plays the same role that a vagina

473
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,360
would play in another

474
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,280
situation so if i were going to

475
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,600
build a separate extension i would

476
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,000
simply say let's extend the data type of

477
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,840
that element

478
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,240
and people will

479
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,159
notice if they don't

480
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,840
interpret it

481
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,000
there will be no false intervality which

482
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
is really what versioning mostly is

483
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,320
about

484
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,960
so i

485
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,600
really think we should move on and

486
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,840
discuss this further

487
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,640
uh

488
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,840
either

489
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,240
on the mailing list or if we have time

490
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,360
at the end

491
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,840
i just we are i think more than 10

492
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,840
minutes

493
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,280
behind the schedule and we have used all

494
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,360
of our flex 10

495
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,840
so let's continue and

496
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,158
move back to dc4 temperament

497
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,600
so then

498
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,159
tell us two documents on this page are

499
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,039
the x509 that we will

500
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,440
discuss on the next slide it is in

501
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,240
uh

502
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,640
its pasta adhd evaluation

503
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,000
but there are still a few

504
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,810
small things that we need to

505
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,320
[Music]

506
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,400
improve before it can be

507
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,720
progressed after that

508
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,080
and

509
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,000
the last one is the countersin

510
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,600
draft which

511
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,679
needs to be sent to the is3 and

512
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,600
this will be done

513
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,000
right after this meeting i think yes

514
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
uh so i believe that uh michael

515
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,840
richardson was

516
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,240
tagged to do the shekerbirds write-up

517
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,919
and that that's the only thing we're

518
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,960
waiting on right uh it is already done

519
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,919
i

520
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,159
hadn't noticed that

521
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,960
earlier but

522
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,760
we can now send it

523
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,360
to the isd

524
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,039
okay i think it's been done a long time

525
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,000
actually

526
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,720
yes it has been done for quite some time

527
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,240
so with

528
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,400
that

529
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,120
i will move on

530
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,520
so for the

531
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,480
x509 document there are

532
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,200
a number of issues in github i believe

533
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,200
most of them are already either

534
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,880
are resolved or marked as

535
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,320
one fixed

536
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,120
as you can see some of them have the

537
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,640
attack

538
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,039
fixed question mark

539
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,080
please the people that participated in

540
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,919
those

541
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,520
discussions

542
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,360
take a look if

543
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,799
the issues that were raised are really

544
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,240
resolved

545
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,080
there was like a

546
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,400
big commercial question that

547
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,039
finally got merged but

548
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,960
there were

549
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,720
still

550
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,960
some comments that

551
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,039
i weren't exactly at rest in it so

552
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,230
uh yes

553
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,919
[Music]

554
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,760
please take a look at that

555
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,799
ideally

556
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,960
i would like

557
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,679
to have someone

558
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,400
that will be

559
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,799
responsible for

560
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:11,919
wrapping

561
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,600
decent

562
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,880
declaring

563
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,799
victory

564
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,640
and

565
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,440
so for the fixed issues

566
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,840
and there is the

567
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,840
media type

568
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,520
issue

569
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,240
where i believe

570
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,480
we needed to discuss further with

571
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,010
kirsten how to

572
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,760
[Music]

573
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,159
progress with that one

574
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,120
whether we want one media type or

575
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,639
multiple media types

576
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,400
i think the discussion was around

577
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
that and how to formulate it in the

578
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,400
draft

579
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,000
yes

580
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,039
um was there an action there i'm sorry

581
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,080
so i believe the action is

582
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,679
apart from everyone to have a look who

583
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,919
is engaged in x509 to have a look at the

584
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,760
open issues

585
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,000
so the action for me is uh

586
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,840
the chairs and cars then to

587
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,279
discuss the media type

588
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,400
or if carson already has a good

589
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,200
idea what

590
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,760
kind of text could be suggested that

591
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,120
would be

592
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,200
wonderful otherwise

593
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,120
let's have a

594
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,559
small chat and

595
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,279
try to finish that

596
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,720
yes kirsten

597
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,880
yeah sorry for some reason this was not

598
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,360
my to-do list this would be a very

599
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,919
quick thing to do

600
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,440
okay

601
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,880
sounds perfect thank you

602
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,880
and

603
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,200
yes

604
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,960
i think

605
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,679
the last time it was

606
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,559
john who prepared a

607
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,200
pull request

608
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,200
uh

609
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,880
john would you be

610
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,520
uh willing to

611
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,679
take another look at the

612
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,640
questions and everyone to

613
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,279
also take a look and

614
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,240
unless anyone

615
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,200
complains about their issue not being

616
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,760
resolved and if you don't see anything

617
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,200
please

618
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,159
i just fix those

619
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,640
issues would that be

620
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,919
uh okay for you

621
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,200
i

622
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,760
took a quick look some week ago i

623
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,440
think it looked

624
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,840
good i didn't have any

625
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,199
comments yeah thank you

626
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,480
so

627
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,640
uh

628
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,440
i

629
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,600
think those were the

630
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,440
important things and

631
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,960
i guess we wanted to

632
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,880
take another

633
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,919
look

634
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,399
what are the phrasing of the protection

635
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,520
over

636
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,200
x five

637
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,600
uh back and chain

638
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,399
and

639
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,360
x5 t is

640
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,679
clear enough

641
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,840
i believe during the last interview

642
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,960
meeting we said

643
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,640
we want to

644
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,919
at least strongly recommend protecting

645
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,600
those

646
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,760
parameters

647
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,120
uh

648
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,640
so yes

649
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,240
i will

650
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,960
create an issue and uh

651
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,799
work on that

652
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,000
and of course anyone

653
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,799
that has a moment to

654
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,000
help with that please just let me know

655
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,120
but

656
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,039
otherwise let's

657
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,960
say i will be

658
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,000
taking this item

659
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,880
and

660
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
with that i think

661
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,720
and those are all the remaining issues

662
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,440
for the x 509 document

663
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,799
and we can move on to the presentation

664
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,440
from your

665
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,399
uh

666
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,719
okay

667
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,360
okay can you hear me

668
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,360
let me just

669
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,678
stop my presentation and accept your

670
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,760
okay can you see the slides as well

671
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,520
yes

672
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,559
okay good

673
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,279
so this is going to be quick um

674
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,760
there is just one slide or there is a

675
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,360
there is

676
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,440
two slides but there is only one slide

677
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,919
with content and

678
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,640
that's basically yeah status and next

679
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,080
steps the base specification

680
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,080
is stable

681
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,399
we have

682
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,320
had a discussion already at the interim

683
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,799
meeting

684
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,520
there is

685
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,360
this seems to be

686
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,880
fairly mature

687
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,799
we would encourage more reviews

688
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,600
to both look at this

689
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,760
specification and and also have see if

690
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,679
there is an interest in

691
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,200
in in drop testing or i mean

692
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,240
at least testing the

693
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,120
the results from the rust code which is

694
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,479
in the github repo

695
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,840
there was one proposal

696
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,279
we discussed this last time during the

697
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,840
interim and that is that the revocation

698
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,600
parts that's currently only talking

699
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,279
about crls

700
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,919
should be moved to a separate draft so

701
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,640
we should try to complete this part

702
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,200
without revocation and then have uh

703
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,039
serials and

704
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,360
other revocation aspects in a separate

705
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,519
drafts

706
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,279
so that's the uh

707
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,279
that's basically the only

708
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,519
things that we as authors

709
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,440
have i don't know if john wants to add

710
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,559
here

711
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,039
who has been doing the coding and main

712
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,000
part of the specification

713
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,880
you want to add something

714
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,840
not

715
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,279
much um

716
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,960
i think we will have

717
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,559
more time for c 579

718
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,240
here after

719
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,120
uh after i theft hundred and twelve

720
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,159
so i will i plan to do some i already

721
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,760
have uh some updated code or some bugs

722
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,960
in the old code and it didn't support

723
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,279
everything so the code has been updated

724
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,880
i will share that

725
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,799
in a month when i have

726
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,000
checked it also yeah

727
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,760
okay

728
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,000
so yeah so that's it um

729
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,440
first question should we take these

730
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,480
questions

731
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,679
to the chairs want to leave this

732
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,360
question about separating the draft into

733
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,799
two pieces uh whether we need to adopt

734
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,840
the the separate part or not

735
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,360
and also it would be good to have a call

736
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,279
for reviews if there are any

737
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,080
see if there are any volunteers

738
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,960
yes for

739
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,320
the

740
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,679
adoption

741
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:08,559
of

742
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,519
a separate draft

743
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,320
or

744
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,799
maybe even like the

745
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,840
idea itself to have a separate draft

746
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,039
i believe that is

747
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,840
fine

748
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,159
the

749
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,360
the motivation for that was

750
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,039
because it's

751
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,519
separate from the main concern of the

752
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,080
draft or what was the exact motivation

753
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,320
there

754
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,000
well maybe carson could

755
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,880
could fit in there

756
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,158
sorry it was just distracted

757
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,799
uh yes uh kyrsten

758
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,440
okay so the question was i mean i think

759
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,919
basically the reason why why carson

760
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,519
wanted to separate out the revocation

761
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,000
parts was that we have one part which is

762
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,839
fairly mature and the other is still in

763
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,760
progress

764
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,199
and

765
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,320
i suppose that would be a way of

766
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,839
speeding things up that we get something

767
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,760
that is ready earlier but maybe carson

768
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,159
can add

769
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,159
yeah i don't think i have anything to

770
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,839
add to this so

771
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,839
i think it would be good to finish

772
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:37,359
c509 um so if we can speed this up by

773
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,239
doing serials separately

774
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,719
um i think we have more than one thing

775
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,520
that could go into such a separate draft

776
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,520
i don't remember what the other things

777
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,839
were

778
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,200
crl and ocsp has been on the table

779
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,440
currently crls are

780
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,599
in the draft ocsp is not

781
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,520
yeah

782
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,920
so ocsp is probably the the one that i'm

783
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,160
more interested in than than so i think

784
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,320
this is the wrong way around

785
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,079
benjamin maybe you have a position on

786
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,079
this

787
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,960
i was just jumping in to say

788
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,640
that

789
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,560
we might end up in some situation where

790
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,520
like the core c509 spec says

791
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,520
and you need to have some way of using

792
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,320
or conveying replication information

793
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,960
there are multiple ways to do so which

794
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,000
include but are not limited to crls and

795
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,599
ocsp as specified in this other document

796
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,119
but if you want to do your own thing

797
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,880
that also meets the requirements of this

798
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,160
spec

799
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,920
that's the sort of

800
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,480
construction of the relationship between

801
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,079
documents that we see with some

802
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,520
regularity

803
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,000
this sort of thing makes some people a

804
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,359
little uncomfortable

805
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,520
because there's no

806
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,240
mandatory to support way of doing this

807
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,079
and it's sort of saying

808
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,720
there's a key part of the

809
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,800
correct operation of the system as a

810
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,440
whole that we are not specifying

811
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,760
but in some cases it ends up being the

812
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,359
least bad way to proceed

813
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,599
i guess that's

814
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,160
that's a good question

815
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,119
good input so i mean we still have the

816
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,560
option to

817
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,960
to keep it uh as it is if we think that

818
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,880
is better for

819
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,720
for being more clear at what

820
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,240
what type of revocation should be

821
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,040
mandatory if any

822
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,078
he has chosen

823
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,839
some concern

824
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,560
to move forward with uh

825
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,960
this draft without having

826
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,839
um you know a crl draft or some kind of

827
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,200
revocation draft that you could point to

828
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,720
uh

829
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,040
that would follow i mean

830
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,880
it seems like it would

831
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,160
be kind of a gap that

832
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,880
could you know during sector review or

833
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,119
something else could be raised and kind

834
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,880
of block moving uh

835
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,920
this d509 from moving forward

836
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,880
so

837
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,599
i mean if they if the

838
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,680
crl draft or or ocsp draft exists and is

839
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,000
progressing as well then i think that

840
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,800
would be fine but um

841
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,359
yeah you're sort of pointing out that

842
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,280
there's a risk that

843
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,359
uh we end up in a state where we try to

844
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,680
publish c509 and the other stuff just

845
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,680
isn't ready yet and you know we could

846
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,760
sort of force the issue by putting in a

847
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,920
normative reference so that the rfc will

848
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,599
not actually be published until they're

849
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,280
both ready

850
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,520
um

851
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,480
and you know i i'm amenable to that for

852
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,480
many of the reasons you described but

853
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,200
i'm reluctant to say that it is

854
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,359
definitely required

855
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,880
without getting some further input

856
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,000
yes russ

857
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,800
um i'm kind of opposed to the normative

858
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
reference uh

859
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,760
because if we just left it as it is and

860
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,440
finished the work we'd end up in the

861
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,160
same place with one document

862
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
and that seems like a better outcome

863
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,960
than

864
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,440
a document that sits in the

865
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,359
rfc editor's queue for a year

866
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,880
uh hi there i

867
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,839
uh want to point out that ocsp doesn't

868
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,839
actually necessarily work all that well

869
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,400
uh there's easy ways to block ocsp and i

870
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,839
would be reluctant to see this make the

871
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,119
same mistakes

872
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,960
that we've made for years in the x59

873
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,119
world about ocsb

874
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,280
in particular with x509 we've been

875
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,079
pushing on the ocsp must staple trying

876
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,079
to get that to be widely deployed

877
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,720
if c509 certs are going to be deployed

878
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,359
we'd like i'd like to see you know

879
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,440
the must staple stuff

880
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,359
be there from the outset

881
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,359
um

882
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,760
because otherwise it introduces privacy

883
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,119
issues and um

884
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,560
privacy issues if you don't do stapling

885
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,040
and if you don't require stapling then

886
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,079
the then you don't actually solve um the

887
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,119
replication at the time of the

888
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,720
revocation issue

889
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,480
um so if you're gonna try to do

890
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,839
revocation please please uh

891
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,599
take heed of the problems that we've run

892
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,680
into for basically like a decade

893
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,359
um i don't think that means that this

894
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,520
should necessarily hold it up you could

895
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,000
reference the existing x-509 must-staple

896
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,280
questions

897
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,359
and granted that wouldn't work for it

898
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,920
wouldn't necessarily work for a native

899
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,920
c-port but you could normatively

900
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,640
reference existing x-509 must staple

901
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,400
stuff

902
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,079
start work on

903
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,200
the must staple ocsp or crl work that's

904
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,640
cbore specific

905
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,480
and leave that out of a normative

906
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,040
reference in this particular draft just

907
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,119
have that subsequent draft update this

908
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,359
one

909
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,400
okay so my my summary would be that

910
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
having this cla section would be a

911
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,920
device to get this through the isg

912
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,040
uh but

913
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,520
well given that cis are usually not what

914
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,880
you want in a constrained environment

915
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,720
it's not what we would actually use so

916
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,240
it's a

917
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,599
rfc

918
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,640
what was that 6919 must but you know you

919
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,319
you won't

920
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,359
and then we will do something

921
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,640
like ocsp but better in the direction

922
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,760
that

923
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,920
dkg just said

924
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,000
to solve the real problem works for me

925
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,839
yes john and let's uh stop the

926
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:11,279
discussion afterwards

927
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,880
yesterday that mozilla is focusing on

928
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,319
something they call crl light instead of

929
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,640
ocsp but i don't have any

930
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,880
i haven't really read up on what it is

931
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,640
but is that something that that should

932
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,680
be

933
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,640
considered here

934
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,560
we can

935
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,720
junk you share that

936
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,880
either in the minutes or somewhere so

937
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,280
that people can take a look

938
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,119
and maybe discuss that later

939
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,920
uh in the interest of them i suggest

940
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,400
that we move on and look at

941
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,720
are there any volunteers for reviews

942
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:19,120
[Applause]

943
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,359
in order for this draft to

944
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,839
have progress we will need some

945
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,960
reviews and i believe there was a

946
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,680
good amount of support

947
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,720
when we adopted it so

948
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,359
please people that are interested in it

949
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,359
progressing

950
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,079
try to

951
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,280
read street and provide

952
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,520
some feedback

953
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,250
[Applause]

954
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,880
okay well

955
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,319
i don't see anyone

956
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,640
volunteering for now

957
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,760
but

958
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,920
yes

959
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,520
i imagine we'll have to

960
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,280
reach out to people individually

961
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,319
if there are no reviews

962
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,119
uh

963
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,480
so

964
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,440
is there anything more uh for this

965
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,160
presentation

966
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,839
nope

967
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,000
thank you

968
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,560
okay thank you

969
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,760
then

970
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,560
the next item is

971
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,560
hp

972
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,400
k e

973
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,200
and thrust

974
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,720
okay are you gonna share the slides room

975
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,959
i

976
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,000
yes i will share it okay great

977
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,119
okay

978
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,599
all right thank you um just as a bit of

979
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,000
background this is work

980
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,920
that was started in the suit working

981
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,119
group

982
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,359
where

983
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,920
this same set of authors was working on

984
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,400
how do we encrypt a firmware load

985
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,079
and uh we decided that uh

986
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,520
it might be

987
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,079
better to have a

988
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:42,960
uh

989
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,000
the hpke mechanism in

990
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,319
in cos a because we probably weren't the

991
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,640
only ones who were going to need it

992
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,440
and so basically we extracted that piece

993
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,319
out of the suit document and are

994
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,280
proposing that the cos a

995
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,160
working group adopted so let me

996
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,319
give you a little bit of a introduction

997
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,880
to the document next slide please

998
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,280
so um

999
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,920
as i said this was started as part of

1000
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,640
the firmware encryption

1001
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,200
you can see that

1002
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,480
the

1003
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,440
document suit firmware encryption zero

1004
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,319
zero basically is there we wanted

1005
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,720
to be able to support uh pre-shared keys

1006
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,079
and uh that was already offered by cos a

1007
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,720
but we also wanted to do the hpke

1008
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,760
approach

1009
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,119
uh which was not already straightforward

1010
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,000
in cos a so we uh wrote our own

1011
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,079
structures and we wanted to bring them

1012
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,040
here

1013
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,200
uh so that others can

1014
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,920
make use of that same work as opposed to

1015
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,160
it being tied tightly to the

1016
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,000
firmware encryption

1017
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,560
next slide

1018
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,960
so um

1019
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,760
like

1020
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,160
the other um

1021
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,079
similar mechanisms it's got three layers

1022
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,640
uh layer three maintains the parameters

1023
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,119
needed to generate the shared secret

1024
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,839
next slide

1025
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,760
the middle layer contains the encrypted

1026
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,760
content encryption key next slide

1027
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,040
and the top layer contains the encrypted

1028
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,720
payload

1029
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,200
of course it continues to support a

1030
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,960
detached payload as well

1031
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,839
next slide

1032
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,599
so as i said at the beginning not

1033
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,440
burying the lead we're asking the group

1034
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,880
to adopt this because we think it has

1035
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,800
will have usefulness beyond firmware

1036
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,480
encryption

1037
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,119
next slide

1038
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,800
we wanted to point out that

1039
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,960
there's already some implementation

1040
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,880
experience with this

1041
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,680
uh

1042
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,359
the folks at

1043
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,160
arm in particular honest has has done

1044
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,920
this work

1045
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,800
but it's based on steve farrell's uh

1046
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,319
happy key work that was done before that

1047
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,559
happy key relies on openness cell and so

1048
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:57,280
on

1049
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,559
um but this is uh

1050
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,680
the point is it's not just a

1051
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,839
paper spec

1052
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,000
so um

1053
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,800
i think that's the last slide

1054
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,800
but i did want to point out that

1055
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,319
yesterday

1056
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,480
there's been some discussion on the main

1057
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,800
list about this document already

1058
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,599
and uh you know we'll will of course

1059
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,839
take the spec wherever that discussion

1060
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:28,640
leads if the group chooses to adopt it

1061
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,040
i think that's it over to the chairs

1062
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:40,400
so

1063
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,440
um my understanding is that

1064
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,400
your goal with this draft is for it to

1065
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,359
be

1066
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,920
adopted as a working group

1067
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,040
document

1068
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,119
once it is a little bit

1069
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,040
more advanced

1070
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,440
is that correct

1071
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,000
yes that's correct

1072
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,319
okay do you want me to run the queue or

1073
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,200
do you want to run it

1074
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,000
yes that's

1075
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,960
that would be good thank you

1076
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,599
okay joe

1077
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,359
you're only using the unauthenticated

1078
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,240
modes for hpk is do you guys have any

1079
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,559
use case for authenticated modes or do

1080
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,319
you think it would be something that

1081
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:31,839
would be

1082
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,280
could be added in or is there a

1083
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,640
restriction of jose i'm not that

1084
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,680
familiar with jose

1085
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,640
uh no we don't uh

1086
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,960
so in

1087
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,559
suit we

1088
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,480
always have a signature and we

1089
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,240
optionally have encryption and so we

1090
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,920
were depending on that

1091
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,680
um we

1092
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,880
uh kose has a similar structure where

1093
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,599
there's a signature

1094
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,760
or an encryption but

1095
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,520
we could look at that if there's a need

1096
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,680
for it

1097
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,400
but that's that's the current way we the

1098
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,280
the division is done

1099
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,079
okay thanks

1100
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,640
dan

1101
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,880
yeah thanks uh so you mentioned you

1102
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,680
wanted to add a deterministic

1103
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,800
authenticated encryption mode i had

1104
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,520
brought up adding such a mode to the

1105
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,200
hpke and

1106
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,160
cfrg and i received a lot of pushback

1107
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,760
yes i'm wondering if you have a better

1108
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,400
use case than what i was suggesting

1109
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,680
could you explain what your use case is

1110
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,919
um

1111
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:44,960
so

1112
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,960
you're saying in the mail we had that

1113
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,520
discussion

1114
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,240
or uh

1115
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,520
yeah i think i actually had a

1116
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,520
presentation at the last meeting too no

1117
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,599
no what i meant was where are you saying

1118
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,240
i need it

1119
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,240
uh you suggested adding aes key wrap you

1120
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,720
said we need aes key wrap in hpke and

1121
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,480
that's a deterministic authenticated

1122
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,480
encryption mode

1123
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,640
indeed

1124
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,240
the output of the hpke is being used as

1125
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,720
the key encryption key

1126
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,959
that

1127
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:22,319
is so that when a firmware package is

1128
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:25,920
distributed to multiple recipients

1129
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,359
they each

1130
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,640
receive the same ciphertext and obtain

1131
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,839
the

1132
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,160
content encryption key by

1133
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,839
unwrapping the um

1134
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,119
that key

1135
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,000
using

1136
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,839
the one that was encapsulated a kek that

1137
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,240
was encapsulated just for them

1138
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,520
that's the the mechanism we

1139
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,280
it for

1140
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,680
so are you're using the the cipher

1141
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,319
inside of hp that is not

1142
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,640
aes key rapid what you're saying you're

1143
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,160
you're using that to wrap a key and then

1144
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,880
using that key to with ads

1145
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,559
that's correct

1146
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,280
okay thank you

1147
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,439
john

1148
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,400
yep i think this is great work i think

1149
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,920
because i should

1150
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,599
work on this um just the

1151
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,240
more high level question to cool see how

1152
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,599
do we see

1153
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,880
is hpk the future of key exchange in in

1154
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,480
cozy or do we continue to add more

1155
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,040
non hpk algorithms also to cosi

1156
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,000
in

1157
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,280
very shortly there will be new pqc cams

1158
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,319
they will probably be added to hpke and

1159
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:47,040
they will need to be supported in cosi

1160
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,319
will be

1161
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:52,880
will we support both apke and non hpk or

1162
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,280
will koci only usa piggy i don't have a

1163
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,880
answer to that question myself but i

1164
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,960
think it's a high level question we

1165
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,800
should ask ourselves

1166
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,800
if we adopt this draft which i think we

1167
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,160
will

1168
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,079
yeah i i don't know the answer to that

1169
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:09,440
either um

1170
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,280
i think lamps is struggling with the

1171
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,839
same question uh as the post-quantum

1172
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,839
kem's come along

1173
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:20,319
what's the cleanest way to

1174
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:21,599
embrace them

1175
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,559
we're talking about a kem recipient info

1176
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,079
in that environment

1177
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,280
a similar thing could be considered here

1178
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,240
um

1179
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,480
i don't know what the best answer is and

1180
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,480
it's really hard to

1181
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,400
guess what future

1182
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,359
uh algorithms will will look like and

1183
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,520
what parameters they all need

1184
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,359
so

1185
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:44,559
i guess

1186
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,280
this is part of the pain of being

1187
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,319
algorithm agile

1188
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,520
okay um so is the i didn't hear anybody

1189
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,559
speak against doing this uh does that

1190
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,079
mean we'll have a call for adoption on

1191
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,240
the list

1192
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,599
uh we can

1193
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,599
yes this is my i

1194
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,480
think that makes sense

1195
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,759
yes

1196
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,240
okay

1197
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,960
thank you for the presentation and the

1198
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,480
discussion

1199
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,760
and

1200
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,480
with that and let's move to the last

1201
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,960
topic for today the

1202
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,200
uh

1203
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,400
fast verification print the

1204
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,040
uh ecd ac

1205
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,119
i guess just sick

1206
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,119
hello

1207
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,079
can anybody hear me

1208
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,880
we can hear you

1209
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,160
yes

1210
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,920
sorry i got an error on my screen for

1211
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,480
some reason

1212
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:23,200
um we are not seeing any slides though

1213
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,439
no

1214
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,559
and you want me to share this flight in

1215
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:33,400
the interest of time and uh

1216
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,680
you will just let me know when to

1217
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,160
advance

1218
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,839
okay

1219
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,559
all right

1220
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,000
um

1221
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,040
good morning afternoon everybody um i

1222
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,119
see i have less than five minutes left

1223
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,599
so it's probably going to be hard to go

1224
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,799
through the slides but i will try anyway

1225
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,760
i to catch the main concept so what i

1226
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,319
wanted to do today is

1227
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:18,960
try to introduce a way to uh use ecdsa

1228
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,640
which is very well known and has been

1229
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,920
over 20 years in a way that allows

1230
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,000
faster verification

1231
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,079
and i think it's a useful effort for

1232
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:28,839
this

1233
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:31,839
group so the outline is the for the

1234
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:32,799
following

1235
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:35,599
and i'll just skip this part in the

1236
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,319
interest of time

1237
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:41,200
and so i just want to recap the ec dsa

1238
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,280
algorithm as we all know it's an

1239
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,599
elliptic curve based signature scheme

1240
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,400
which produces signature consisting of

1241
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,520
two components usually denoted as an r

1242
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,799
and s

1243
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:55,680
where the second signature component s

1244
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,480
is

1245
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,319
dependent on the first signature

1246
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:00,319
component and the private

1247
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:01,359
key

1248
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:02,319
in

1249
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:06,400
a way using a signing equation

1250
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,960
and the important thing to notice

1251
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,359
during the signing is that this

1252
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,200
signature component r

1253
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,160
is

1254
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,720
derived from the ephemeral signing key

1255
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,040
big r

1256
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,319
verification involves several steps

1257
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:23,520
it involves

1258
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,319
recomputing this ephemeral signing key

1259
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:27,359
are

1260
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,920
and then checking whether it maps to the

1261
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,760
same signature component small r

1262
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,040
so this is a very nice algorithm and has

1263
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,319
been widely adopted but the problem with

1264
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:42,960
it is that it doesn't really allow a

1265
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,119
fast

1266
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,760
batch verification so checking a number

1267
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,640
of sequences at the same time

1268
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,520
there's also a way to

1269
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,319
speed up a single verification

1270
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:58,880
um but that

1271
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,160
is only possible if we use similar to

1272
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,480
like ed dsa

1273
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,640
so the

1274
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,000
essentially the bernstein signature

1275
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,780
where uh the signature instead of uh

1276
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,079
[Music]

1277
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,960
consisting of the small rns components

1278
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,440
replaces this r component by the thermal

1279
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,440
signing key

1280
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,160
and what is the impact of that change

1281
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,880
the impact is that

1282
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,839
we can essentially

1283
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,599
massage the

1284
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,839
verification equation that's

1285
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,160
the last verification step mentioned on

1286
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,040
this ecd is a star

1287
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,720
slide

1288
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,000
um

1289
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,079
and then it suddenly becomes only an

1290
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:49,920
algebraic equation that has to be

1291
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,079
checked

1292
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:53,839
and

1293
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:56,480
so that allows

1294
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,680
a speed up of roughly 30 percent in the

1295
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,480
single verification case and if you have

1296
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,799
for example a certificate chain

1297
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:05,839
or you

1298
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:07,760
have for whatever reason you want to

1299
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,240
check multiple signatures the same load

1300
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,480
balancing or something like that then

1301
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,440
you can get a speed up of roughly a

1302
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,119
factor six

1303
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,079
and the downside is that

1304
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:24,079
that the speed up only applies if

1305
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,720
we use a slightly different format

1306
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,240
for

1307
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,480
the signature itself

1308
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,440
so

1309
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,920
uh the objective of the next few slides

1310
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,599
is to show that actually the format can

1311
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:38,240
be the same

1312
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:41,760
so

1313
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,680
i'm i'm going to explain this trick and

1314
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,760
i i think i have only like one minute

1315
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:46,720
left

1316
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,799
i i just want to point out on the next

1317
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:49,839
slide

1318
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:52,280
there is an example in the rfc

1319
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,839
7515

1320
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:56,559
about how to use ecdsa in a josie

1321
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,720
context

1322
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,079
and

1323
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,559
that example gives

1324
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,960
an ecd's a signature

1325
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,480
uh rs that's option one that is printed

1326
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,319
in that specification

1327
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,000
an important thing to notice is that

1328
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:12,839
with

1329
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:16,000
ecdsa you always get two signatures that

1330
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,240
are possible and that is due to the

1331
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,799
so-called b9 malleability property of

1332
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:24,640
ecdsa so instead of having one signature

1333
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,920
you always can make a second one and

1334
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,000
that can be done by anybody

1335
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,319
without having access to the

1336
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:34,000
private keying material

1337
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,440
so in terms of

1338
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,559
this example you get two options for the

1339
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,559
signature

1340
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,480
and um

1341
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,799
the important property

1342
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:46,079
is that

1343
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:46,799
in

1344
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:48,799
one of the options

1345
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:50,799
the if you actually would do the

1346
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:53,040
verification step itself

1347
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,520
you would have an ephemeral signing key

1348
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,359
where the

1349
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,520
so-called y-coordinate of this thermal

1350
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,240
signing key is odd and the other one is

1351
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,480
even

1352
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,720
so

1353
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:10,480
what he can do is he can try to pick

1354
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,040
any ecdsa signature of these two options

1355
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,599
at will

1356
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:16,880
and

1357
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,480
as you see

1358
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,640
if we have for example the rule that we

1359
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,480
always want to have the

1360
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,480
y corner to be even

1361
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,280
then we in this case pick option two

1362
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,480
but in in any case in in all in all

1363
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,799
signatures we have two options one of

1364
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,280
them with the assigning keys y corner to

1365
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,480
be odd and the other one even

1366
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,240
so let's look at this

1367
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,359
suppose we always

1368
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:45,760
pick the option where

1369
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,559
the

1370
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,880
used signing key was

1371
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,200
with y coordinate even

1372
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,400
then

1373
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,240
we are actually able

1374
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,200
to

1375
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,640
express the

1376
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,920
ec dj signature as yet one of those two

1377
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,640
options for the same ecd jsongju so it

1378
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,119
remains an ecdsa signature

1379
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:06,960
but

1380
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,480
since the signature consists of

1381
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,000
the the x-coordinate of the signing key

1382
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,880
and the y-coordinate

1383
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,280
if we know this the parity of that

1384
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,240
y-coordinate we can uniquely recover the

1385
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,319
thermal signing key from the signature

1386
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:26,240
itself without first doing the entire

1387
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:30,240
verification and that allows to speed up

1388
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,520
so

1389
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,799
the

1390
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:35,599
procedure to get uh

1391
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:37,599
to more of these two signature schemes

1392
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:40,160
versions uh together

1393
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,559
is that we generate the signature always

1394
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,319
in the same way as

1395
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:47,599
we have done the like the last 20 years

1396
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:48,640
but

1397
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,200
if the signing key has

1398
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,039
an odd y-coordinate

1399
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:54,640
then we just

1400
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,440
toggle the sign of the second signature

1401
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,000
component

1402
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,720
that allows to represent the

1403
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,839
signature in such a way that the thermal

1404
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:07,520
signing key can be

1405
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,000
recovered and that all the speed ups are

1406
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,480
obtained

1407
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,319
i will think i will just go soon in the

1408
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:19,920
interest

1409
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,480
yeah yeah go to the last slide

1410
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,319
so um

1411
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:26,160
i think we don't really have time to go

1412
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,280
over all the details but uh the main

1413
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,799
reason that i wanted to present

1414
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:32,960
something is right now there's lots of

1415
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,319
interest in

1416
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:36,880
initiatives that use uh

1417
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,200
josie signatures

1418
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,839
for example in e-health initiatives for

1419
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:43,520
example just to get in a restaurant you

1420
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,520
have to show you qr codes there's lots

1421
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,839
of things and that uses uh

1422
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:50,480
jws signatures

1423
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,680
and i think there's an excellent

1424
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,920
opportunity to make some of these things

1425
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,359
speedier but for that we need

1426
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:00,319
this to be facilitated by uh

1427
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:01,599
idf

1428
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:03,680
so the question is whether people are

1429
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:07,039
interested in in looking at this further

1430
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:10,319
and how we can make sure that we

1431
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:12,480
move quickly on that and what i need to

1432
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,760
do to in order to satisfy uh

1433
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,200
you know your requirements

1434
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:23,200
i'll leave it at that for now

1435
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:28,880
yes thank you for the presentation uh if

1436
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,480
people are interested for sure be

1437
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,680
uh sure to reach out to renee

1438
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,799
uh

1439
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:39,440
he hasn't smells to demonically so

1440
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,280
you'll find also there are his

1441
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,359
coordinates

1442
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:45,039
and we are

1443
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:49,039
quite over time so unless there are any

1444
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,880
special comments i think we can

1445
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,680
close at that thank you very much for

1446
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,760
the participation

1447
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,050
and

1448
01:04:58,050 --> 01:04:59,119
[Music]

1449
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:02,559
have a nice day

1450
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,480
thanks

1451
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,720
you
