7
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,320
more minutes

hi everyone i was just troubleshooting

9
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,840
with our first speaker on how to get in

10
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,440
so i'm also going to just message the

11
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
meet echo people really quick about this

12
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,600
issue and then we can get started and

13
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,120
i'm sure she'll be here before

14
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,560
we are finished with the intro

15
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,440
thanks for bearing with me

16
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,479
okay brilliant so um

17
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,600
welcome to welcome everyone

18
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,560
to

19
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,880
the hrpc session

20
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,960
of the internet research task force at

21
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,440
the ietf 112 meeting um we have just one

22
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,639
speaker today followed by discussion of

23
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,479
our drafts and so

24
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,800
i'd like to ask for

25
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,639
a note taker but only for the latter

26
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,880
half of the meeting after the talk

27
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,280
would somebody volunteer themselves by

28
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,919
typing in the chat

29
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,080
anybody who can do notes please

30
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,319
well if you prefer i can always ask

31
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,360
again

32
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,840
uh just before we get to that second

33
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,160
half if i remember it'd be really great

34
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,240
though if somebody could help with the

35
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,800
notes because we'll be discussing

36
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,120
updates on drafts and steps forward

37
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,759
chime in anytime in the chat

38
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,880
um

39
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,520
so then let's go over the agenda

40
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
i'll give you a chance to revise it if

41
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,120
you'd like the

42
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,199
um after the welcome slides we'll have

43
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,240
andrea esterhoisen come to speak about

44
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,879
the internet governance forum

45
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,560
she's currently trying to get in the

46
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,520
room right now and unfortunately

47
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,479
we had a second top talk scheduled

48
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,720
to be delivered by sasha constanza shock

49
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,960
but will not

50
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,680
be able to come

51
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,160
today because of illness it's that time

52
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,599
of year um

53
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,759
i'm definitely due to get a cold because

54
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,440
everyone in my house is sick

55
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,440
so that's that happened

56
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,000
hopefully we'll see sasha at a later

57
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,479
ietf meeting

58
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,520
yeah

59
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,360
pity yeah because i think it's a anyway

60
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,719
nonetheless we uh might be done

61
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,200
earlier than expected because of that

62
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,399
then we have um from me just an intro or

63
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,279
an update rather on draft feminism which

64
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,559
is a

65
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,240
project we started

66
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,920
as part of this research group wasn't

67
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,720
formally adopted but juliana is here i

68
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,120
see who's the co-author on that um just

69
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,519
wanted to give you some updates and ask

70
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,600
your thoughts on way forward with that

71
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,720
work

72
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,640
and then we have a bunch of updates in

73
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,839
general so this is where i'm going to

74
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,080
rely on colin a lot

75
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,519
about the

76
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,600
status of

77
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,040
at least one draft on draft guidelines

78
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,959
and then i think meals there's a draft

79
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,279
association that might have an update or

80
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,160
two

81
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,760
it's expired but i know you're still

82
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,600
working on it and then lastly i think

83
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,680
we'll maybe get an update on the search

84
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,440
for a co-chair for hrpc because you'll

85
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,200
notice i'm here

86
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,920
alone today although it is really nice

87
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,080
that both aubry and niels are here so

88
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,360
once you've been a co-chair of this

89
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,160
group you never actually leave you just

90
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,720
stop sharing

91
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,960
okay good so i've heard that um

92
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,959
[Music]

93
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,240
andrea is on her way um let me continue

94
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,839
on with the intro because we've got a

95
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,240
few slides that you need to see

96
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,800
so the notewow slides um

97
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,959
these are from the irtf um but also they

98
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,560
comply with the ietf general um

99
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,440
ipr disclosure rules so familiarize

100
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,040
yourselves with these please

101
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,320
but you've probably seen them a few

102
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,720
times already this week um

103
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,800
the code of conduct is an important

104
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,160
piece also of the notewell so um

105
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,399
it's good for me now to remind everyone

106
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,880
that this is being recorded it will be

107
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,200
up on the internet somewhere very

108
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,720
shortly after

109
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,240
um so keep that in mind

110
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,800
um and you know behave yourself

111
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,160
then um

112
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,000
just wanted to give a general intro to

113
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,959
this group and to the irtf so

114
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,160
um

115
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,640
we are

116
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,440
we're not part of the iata we're not

117
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,000
setting standards um we're working on

118
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
the long-term issues of the internet and

119
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,720
one of them being certainly

120
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,000
human rights and the impacts

121
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,240
going both directions

122
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,000
that is what

123
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,720
hrpc does

124
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,880
it was chartered to look at how

125
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,800
protocols strengthen

126
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,839
or weaken human rights as defined in

127
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,519
your universal declaration of human

128
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,320
rights um and the

129
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,040
international criminal

130
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,240
court

131
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,279
never remember the acronym so the um the

132
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,600
point i think also happens the other way

133
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,839
whereas that as things change

134
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,160
in um the field of human rights and

135
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,000
other things how does that maybe impact

136
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,399
as well the way that we um design and

137
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,240
develop protocols that's maybe the idea

138
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,040
as well so um we have some explicit

139
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,360
objectives then as part of our charter

140
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,519
um we're obviously talking about this

141
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,079
relationship um of human rights and

142
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,480
protocols in general but in specific we

143
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,680
look at

144
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,640
two

145
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,480
of the human rights the first is

146
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,600
the right to freedom of expression

147
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,000
and the second is the right

148
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,519
to freedom of assembly and association

149
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,839
privacy also sometimes factors in quite

150
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,519
a bit since that's also a human right

151
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,600
but there is another research group for

152
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,920
that um that does i think the bulk of

153
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,160
that work in the irtf

154
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,639
um in addition to just talking about the

155
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,240
relationships

156
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,800
between these two sets of standards

157
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,200
human rights as a standard

158
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,399
and also

159
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,279
then internet protocols and standards

160
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,959
we want to actually develop specific

161
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,720
guidelines

162
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,399
this is kind of

163
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,480
envisioned as how the privacy

164
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,200
considerations of rfc 6973 were were

165
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
thought up um and we've worked towards

166
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,240
that um second objective with uh draft

167
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,839
guidelines which we'll be updating you

168
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,200
all about

169
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,399
um

170
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,920
in just a little while

171
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,959
um

172
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,120
and then the other thing that is key to

173
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,200
note about this group is that it isn't

174
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,320
the work happening here is not totally

175
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,399
just self-contained within the research

176
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,600
group a lot of us are engaged outside

177
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,760
of um

178
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,000
[Music]

179
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,320
this

180
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,440
um

181
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,480
so

182
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,959
that means that the larger human rights

183
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,200
community hopefully is made aware of

184
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,839
some of the things happening in this

185
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,760
technical community

186
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,279
and then vice versa

187
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,680
okay

188
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,040
so

189
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,760
moving on i'm just also chatting with

190
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,319
the um

191
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,639
the issue around henriette coming in so

192
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,760
um yeah so specifically then in the

193
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
human rights protocol considerations

194
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,839
research group we are looking beyond

195
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,680
just drafts as well

196
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,240
just internet drafts in the irtf

197
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,079
we also

198
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,839
have done a lot of work to invite

199
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,800
speakers from academic community from

200
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,880
civil society organizations and and

201
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,959
others we had a speaker not too long ago

202
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,199
from erickson talking about 5g you know

203
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,440
we're an equal opportunity

204
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,720
um

205
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,399
group and

206
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,120
we want to have um

207
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,440
you know influence and be influenced by

208
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,279
other other groups so policy and

209
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,720
academic papers

210
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,639
also result from some of the work

211
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,320
happening here

212
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,079
at some point there was a film which is

213
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,440
really cool um there have been

214
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,120
interviews as well so these are other

215
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,720
products of the working group outside of

216
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,519
just

217
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,320
you know

218
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,480
rfcs and ids and that sort of thing um

219
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,360
folks

220
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,160
have suggested use of data analysis for

221
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,959
some of this research um we had at the

222
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,440
last meeting 111

223
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,480
sebastian come and talk about big bang

224
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,399
there's an upcoming iab workshop on the

225
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,600
same

226
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,320
so that can help as well further ideas

227
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,279
around

228
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,040
data-driven research that we could do in

229
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,000
hrpc which is excellent

230
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,839
and

231
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,920
um yeah we want to then through the

232
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,920
guidelines document of rfc 8280 um or

233
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,480
based on a280 to also then review um

234
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,720
um

235
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,560
the

236
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,720
protocols elsewhere in the ietf based on

237
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,959
this so we're actively

238
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,839
a lot of us from hrpc are

239
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,760
consciously and active

240
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,639
consciously active in the ietf

241
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,399
to think about human rights

242
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,800
as we engage in those

243
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,079
groups

244
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,240

thanks okay

247
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,240
continuing so yeah the work to date um

248
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
i mentioned some of these already

249
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,959
we were chartered um

250
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,839
you know

251
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,440
some years ago

252
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,959
there's been a film

253
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,320
there has been also then one rfc 8280

254
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,360
that i mentioned um

255
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,079
thanks niels for putting that workshop

256
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,000
in the chat very helpful

257
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,600
and then we've got

258
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,720
some

259
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,120
not all of these are active in the

260
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,880
technical data tracker sense though

261
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,560
they're active because i know they're

262
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,759
being worked on um we have uh guidelines

263
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,000
for human rights protocol considerations

264
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,560
um that's in

265
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,480
the that's just been reviewed actually

266
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,880
by colin the rtf chair

267
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,040
so that's progressing um and then we

268
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,839
have as well um active draft on freedom

269
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,360
of association

270
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,839
on the internet and another one on

271
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,519
feminism and protocols you'll get an

272
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,959
update on

273
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,040
both of them today

274
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,839
and where they're at

275
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,399
though that is um what i have for you

276
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,240
right now as far as an intro we still

277
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,399
don't have henriette in the chat because

278
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,079
apparently there's just been a confusion

279
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,759
about her um registration so if you

280
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,279
allow me to put myself on mute for a

281
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,440
second i'm going to go back to our

282
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,880
agenda

283
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,279
and then ask you if you have

284
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,360
any changes you'd like to make is there

285
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,120
any other business

286
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,360
um

287
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,320
things you want to add

288
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,160
songs you want to sing dances you want

289
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,279
to do

290
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,839
trying to fill time

291
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,720
uh hi mallory does it make sense to

292
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,559
maybe do some of the updates on the

293
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,240
drafts while we're trying to get

294
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,959
henrietta

295
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,880
make sense to me

296
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,959
yeah i appreciate that so let's jump to

297
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,400
item

298
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,919
five

299
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,079
and i can save my presentation on draft

300
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,319
feminism for after henriette so yeah

301
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,160
status updates we can just take these in

302
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,960
turn do you wanna um do we wanna talk is

303
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,720
there anything to say about the co-chair

304
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,039
search

305
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,880
yeah hi uh so for the the co-chair

306
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,679
search uh you

307
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,440
sent me um some really good candidates

308
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
and then i failed to get a chance to

309
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,360
talk to them so that is entirely my

310
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,080
fault uh and i i realize i i'm running

311
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,840
behind on that

312
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,520
but yeah i mean that they thought there

313
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,360
looked to be some some really good uh

314
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,919
potential uh co-chairs on that list and

315
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,160
uh i'm hoping to talk to them next week

316
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,360
uh

317
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,799
we will see

318
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,799
but yeah i realize i'm behind on that

319
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,840
it should be fine

320
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,000
uh that got cut off at the beginning i'm

321
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,320
afraid

322
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,919
there was also some feedback but

323
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,320

little while and yeah i'm hoping to get

340

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,480
yeah go ahead nails

344
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,799
hi all does this mean that there are

345
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,640
several candidates for the new

346
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,400
co-chairship did i just hear that

347
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,880
correctly

348
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,960
yeah so the process was that we did um

349
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,200
outreach to the list and actually to

350
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
other places as well this is going with

351
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,799
some of our goals and objectives for the

352
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,640
group we wanted to cast our net wide

353
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,880
into other communities so you

354
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,640
folks who are tuned in to this work

355
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,039
might have seen me put like email a few

356
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,600
different places um after

357
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
i didn't really put a deadline on it for

358
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
when i wanted folks to email me if they

359
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,960
were interested

360
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,520
but it was clear that interest

361
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,280
sort of flared up and then sort of

362
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,440
petered out so at some point i went

363
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,360
through folks who had emailed me i

364
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,880
looked at their cvs and then i gave

365
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,600
colin a sort of short list of folks that

366
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,640
i thought

367
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,600
fit the criteria that we'd sort of

368
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,000
looked at so we were hoping to get since

369
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,760
i represent civil society we were hoping

370
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,159
to get one or even two additional

371
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,760
co-chairs that would be either coming

372
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,320
from industry coming from academia

373
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,880
and that had complementary

374
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,440
background and skills so sociologists

375
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,840
has always been on our wish list for um

376
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
co-chair ships and so based on what i

377
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,600
understood to be the criteria i gave

378
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,919
colin a few options and i think again

379
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,320
like it could be that not just one new

380
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,679
um

381
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,600
one new church could join another one

382
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,240
could as well or even you know since

383
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,960
there's interest and folks um getting

384
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,240
involved in this work which is always

385
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,919
flattering we can also think of other

386
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,400
roles right like please come uh give a

387
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,200
presentation please come you know help

388
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,320
document shepard or edit um this work

389
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,080
that sort of thing so that's we're

390
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,159
hoping that actually everyone who

391
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,679
reached out with interest um can find um

392
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,960
work here in the um hr pc

393
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,840
um that that's my ulterior motive but

394
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,679
it'd be good also to have um at least

395
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,520
one co-chair as well before the next

396
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,360
meeting so

397
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,400
yeah and uh i mean a comment i give to

398
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,320
research groups regularly is is that you

399
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,840
have a lot of flexibility in your

400
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,200
process so

401
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,840
if there are a role roles you can find

402
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,679
to bring in people uh even if they're

403
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,880
not

404
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,559
the sort of traditional role you might

405
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,360
see in an ietf group then you know the

406
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,880
research groups have the flexibility to

407
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,840
do things in a different way if that's

408
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,640
useful

409
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,000
if it helps advance the goals

410
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,039
any other comments on this you can come

411
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,760
to the mic or you can

412
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,200
okay so there's a good question in the

413
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,799
chat about good starting place for

414
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,880
newcomers um well this is a really good

415
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,960
starting place um to be here in this

416
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,720
meeting so thanks for joining we're

417
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,039
gonna go over sort of current work items

418
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,559
and um

419
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,400
and then yeah there's also a website

420
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,960
that we have um that is a little bit

421
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,760
more detailed than the the information

422
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,679
about hpc and the data tracker and the

423
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,520
other thing you might do and this is

424
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,919
maybe some slight change we could add to

425
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,360
that um

426
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,679
website niels just shared which is to

427
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,559
watch

428
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,240
older

429
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,559
um meetings that are now all on youtube

430
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,559
so you can go back

431
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,280
and see what um some of the speakers

432
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,159
we've had come to talk about work it's

433
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,440
it doesn't always it doesn't always

434
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,280
result in a draft

435
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,919
uh necessarily um but i think it

436
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,400
introduces the possibility for um for

437
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,960
collaboration and research and then um

438
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,679
of course you get um sort of the you can

439
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,880
track the different um drafts we've had

440
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,960
um the discussion about those and that

441
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
sort of thing

442
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,200
um

443
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,280
right

444
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,400
so i think

445
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:54,760
um

446
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,320
[Music]

447
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,799
what else could we talk about i think um

448
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,640
actually if we could get an update from

449
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,080
you colin while you're still on camera

450
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,039
and here on uh draft guidelines i saw

451
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,200
and everybody should have seen your

452
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,799
review of that go to the hrpc list i

453
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,480
believe or if it didn't it just went to

454
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,080
authors but it was very thorough of you

455
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,000
i thought your comments really excellent

456
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,520
if you wanted to sign post some of this

457
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,200
uh yes i think i sent it to the hr pc

458
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
list so hopefully everyone should have

459
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,799
seen that

460
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:27,600
um

461
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,400
yeah so i mean this is draft guidelines

462
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,039
dash 10 so it's a draft irt feature pc

463
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,039
guidelines dash 10.

464
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,440
um a a since a really long uh detailed

465
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,919
review um i guess it was over the

466
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,600
weekend i forget possibly the end of

467
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,719
last week um

468
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,799
i actually thought this document was

469
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,200
really interesting it's

470
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,600
a really interesting read

471
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,720
there were a whole bunch of

472
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,679
really interesting questions it raises

473
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,240
and a lot of things to think about when

474
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,400
designing protocols and developing

475
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,000
standards

476
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,400
um so it i think it's it's an important

477
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,480
document uh i think it's something that

478
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,039
the the group needs to finish up uh and

479
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,679
i i can see it being very useful to the

480
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,559
community when it's finished

481
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,559
in terms of the

482
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,440
um

483
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,320
content i i had

484
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,120
five main issues and then

485
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,678
a bunch of details

486
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,240
the the main issues um

487
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,200
i mean the the document is structured

488
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,919
around you using the you're in

489
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,400
declaration of human rights uh

490
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,240
and a bunch of other

491
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,200
similar documents to to signpost the

492
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,760
list of human rights to consider uh and

493
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,240
then builds up a bunch of questions

494
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,360
uh to think about when when bill you're

495
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,039
designing a protocol and how those

496
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,679
relate to those rights

497
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,840
um

498
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,120
and

499
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,559
i mean that that seems to me as

500
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,200
someone who who isn't a

501
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,360
human rights lawyer or uh

502
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,520
you know isn't active in that space as a

503
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,640
plausible

504
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,400
way of starting it

505
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,760
um

506
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,279
i

507
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,360
would have found it more helpful if the

508
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,600
documents had said more about those

509
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,360
rights

510
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,640
um

511
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,480
you know as someone coming in from an

512
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,480
engineering background i i can read the

513
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,080
headline

514
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,400
definitions in there and i can sort of

515
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,080
guess what they mean

516
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,559
but obviously you know different

517
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,400
um you know there will be a body of

518
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,559
experience of interpreting those those

519
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,480
rights a bunch of different people and

520
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,159
perhaps in different countries will have

521
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,200
um

522
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,279
different interpretations of what those

523
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,760
rights and those responsibilities mean

524
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,120
um and i i would expect that the extent

525
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,039
to which they're incorporated into

526
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,080
various national laws would vary and

527
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,159
the way the different national laws

528
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,640
interpret those rights uh and the way

529
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,240
different cultures and different

530
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,919
countries interpret those rights would

531
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,679
vary

532
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,840
um so i think it would help the reader

533
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,120
if the document said

534
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,120
more about what are those rights and um

535
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,039
perhaps how the authors interpret them

536
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,640
but also perhaps

537
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,960
how they're interpreted in in different

538
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,880
bodies of law and in different cultures

539
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,120
in different countries um

540
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,880
and giving some sort of concrete

541
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,159
examples of that which

542
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,919
might make this perhaps somewhat

543
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,200
abstract discussion about rights uh

544
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,279
something quite concrete which people

545
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,679
developing protocols can see how they

546
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,000
directly relate to them

547
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,200
um

548
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,320
and

549
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,010
you know um

550
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,159
[Music]

551
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,600
freedom of speech for example gets

552
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,279
mentioned a lot and i think that's one

553
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,360
thing where um

554
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,840
for example a u.s based interpretation

555
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,919
and a european interpretation might

556
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,960
differ in in ways which would surprise

557
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,360
some people uh i think once we start

558
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,520
getting into the various privacy laws

559
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,200
handling of personal data and how they

560
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,159
relate to the rights um

561
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,640
it seems that the the gdpr for example

562
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,320
is quite different to the the equivalent

563
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,799
laws in the us or in china or in other

564
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,039
places so something that talks about how

565
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,279
these rights get reflected down into

566
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,120
regulations and how those differ around

567
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,960
the world and maybe giving some examples

568
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,760
of

569
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,000
how they turn into concrete regulations

570
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,200
that people

571
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
you know have to conform to

572
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,760
might help make this real to the the

573
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,120
engineers actually designing the

574
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,279
protocols and make it clear why this is

575
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,960
a real

576
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,640
you know a real concern they actually

577
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,799
have to pay attention to rather than an

578
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,320
abstract would-be nice concern

579
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,039
um and if nothing else it means that uh

580
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,960
you know it's it's easier to say well

581
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,559
you know you you need to pay attention

582
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,159
to this because you will be subject to

583
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,000
this set of laws and you should be start

584
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,679
paying attention to how they relate to

585
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,960
human rights and how it affects your

586
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
products

587
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,320
so i think some of that discussion would

588
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,399
be useful just to set the scene and make

589
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,360
it more concrete

590
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,360
um in terms of the the later bits of the

591
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,559
document um

592
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,760
it's

593
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,159
it talks about development of protocols

594
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,080
and having human rights reviews of

595
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,440
protocols um and i guess that's more of

596
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,679
a historical thing from the way

597
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,760
the group has evolved and the way the

598
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,720
document has involved

599
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,039
i'm hoping this can turn into something

600
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,880
where um

601
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,399
it's more something which critical

602
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,720
design is taking to take on board as

603
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,520
they develop the protocol

604
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,760
uh rather than where a group of people

605
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,600
comes your parachutes into the group and

606
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,279
says hi we're from the human rights

607
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,600
review team we're here to help

608
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,360
um

609
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,159
and i think that yeah i think phrasing

610
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,240
it perhaps in a less

611
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,840
less of a you are being reviewed for

612
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,159
human rights more of a here are a bunch

613
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,399
of questions that you may want to think

614
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,520
about when you're designing your

615
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,760
protocol i think i think would just make

616
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,399
it a slightly less antagonistic

617
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,480
adversarial process and might make

618
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,640
make it a little easier sell to parts of

619
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,360
the community

620
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,480
um the big bit was the

621
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,039
the meat of the dread is a long list of

622
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,159
questions to consider um to illustrate

623
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,440
various human rights choices um

624
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,360
and as i said at the beginning there's a

625
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,679
lot of really good questions there right

626
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,960
and

627
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,320
there are certainly things i hadn't

628
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,480
thought about i'm sure that

629
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,000
most of the people in this community

630
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,440
there will be things that they they

631
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,520
haven't thought about and would deserve

632
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,600
to think more about i'm saying that's a

633
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,399
really nice list of questions

634
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,719
um

635
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,360
i thought the the order wasn't

636
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,159
necessarily the most obvious order in

637
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,320
places there was a moderate amount of

638
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,399
overlap between the questions um

639
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,919
so a um

640
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,799
you know i think there are there are

641
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,559
some ways in which this could be fixed

642
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,960
editorially um

643
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
which would make the material easier to

644
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,840
follow

645
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,720
i think in in places the document

646
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,440
was phrased in ways that

647
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,440
advocate particular approaches without

648
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,919
necessarily acknowledging the the

649
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,760
complexity of the the trade-offs

650
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,039
one one example might be there was some

651
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,320
um

652
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,840
there was some discussion of

653
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,240
prioritization um and it it talks about

654
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,200
the network neutrality impacts of it and

655
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,159
the impact on choice and and topics like

656
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,480
that if i'm remembering right

657
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,080
uh and and you know these are all

658
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,679
clearly real issues and like they're

659
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,000
clearly potential problems um

660
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,600
what the

661
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,519
if i'm remembering it right what it

662
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,360
didn't so much to talk about was well

663
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,360
there's also arguments for being able to

664
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,240
prioritize certain types of traffic um

665
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,159
you know if i make an emergency call on

666
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,559
my voiceover ip phone uh i would quite

667
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,880
like the the traffic to be prioritized

668
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,919
uh over the neighbors kids watching um

669
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,080
sort of cartoons and using up all the

670
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,960
local link bandwidth right um

671
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,120
and i think if you look at a bunch of

672
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,600
these issues raised there's

673
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,159
that there's arguments for you for and

674
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,159
against prioritizing certain types of

675
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,360
certain characteristics um

676
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,240
and

677
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,480
in most of the cases there is a

678
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,880
trade-off to be made

679
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,640
we saw something similar i guess with a

680
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,240
quick group and the spin bits where

681
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,200
you know

682
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,159
certain people wanted to to be able to

683
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:02,960
um

684
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,200
measure the network for various reasons

685
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,279
um some people wanted measurement not to

686
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,360
happen um

687
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,200
and um

688
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,960
obviously there are clearly ways you can

689
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,559
go way too far

690
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,320
in the measurement and collect far too

691
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,880
much information and be very invasive of

692
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,480
privacy

693
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,640
equally going entirely the other

694
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,720
direction not allowing any measurement

695
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,799
makes the network unmanageable

696
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,399
and there is a need for the network

697
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,320
operators to have some information about

698
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,000
the traffic flows just to see that the

699
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,960
network is is correctly being operated

700
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,320
and there was a big discussion about

701
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,240
that and we you know

702
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,640
the group eventually after um

703
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,320
more discussion than i would imagined

704
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,760
would have imagined was possible about

705
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,279
one bit eventually came to some

706
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,200
consensus on

707
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,799
how that should be done

708
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,320
but you know in most of these cases

709
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,240
there's a trade-off and it's

710
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,720
it's balancing different um

711
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,480
different needs and different concerns

712
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,559
and that balance doesn't always come

713
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,799
across in places

714
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,039
um

715
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,919
and i think it would be be useful to

716
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,679
adopt more of a sort of neutral point of

717
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,760
view you know here are the trade-offs if

718
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,679
you are trying to optimize for this then

719
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,120
you need to consider the following

720
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,039
things and emphasize the following

721
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,399
things if you're trying to optimize for

722
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,320
that then you need to

723
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,120
um

724
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,120
rather than necessarily advocating one

725
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,200
approach and giving the impression that

726
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,960
if if you are not fully behind that then

727
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,279
um you know that's

728
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,600
that's that's a problem

729
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,120
uh and you know i don't think that

730
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,519
that's the intent but the way the doc

731
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,679
draft comes across in places it could be

732
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,200
it could be balanced out a little bit

733
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,039
more

734
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,200
um and i i think there are

735
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,080
also a couple of places and i'm

736
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,080
blanking on examples right now where um

737
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,159
it could perhaps be a little bit clearer

738
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,360
on what the

739
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,399
general

740
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,240
what concrete things the protocol

741
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,039
designer can do to emphasize particular

742
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,679
outcomes you know if you want if this is

743
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:02,799
your goal

744
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,600
then

745
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,399
you know

746
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,919
emphasize this thing and if that's your

747
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,079
goal then emphasize the other thing and

748
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,760
there's a couple of places where it

749
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,520
highlights an issue but doesn't really

750
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,679
suggest which directions to go depending

751
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,800
on what you're trying to optimize for

752
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,119
so i think that was my high level view

753
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,760
um as i say there's a lot of really good

754
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,879
work in here there's a lot of really

755
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,800
good questions in here it's just getting

756
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,440
them structured in a way phrased in a

757
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,359
way and perhaps getting a little more

758
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,480
detail in a bunch of places um

759
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,440
to really highlight the issues so

760
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,440
it's it's you know a bunch of

761
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,960
interesting things but not quite there

762
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,199
yet

763
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,119
also on behalf on uh guru shabbat i'd

764
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,320
like to thank you very much for the uh

765
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
for the very much in-depth review which

766
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,918
is which is which was really good and

767
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,599
really helpful and

768
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,119
we already started working on an

769
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,000
approach but uh of course we don't have

770
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,800
uh

771
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,280
don't have it fully fleshed out yet

772
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,440
but please allow me to provide some

773
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,480
preliminary observations

774
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,480
and one thing that is uh

775
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,800
that i think important with draft

776
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
guidelines is that we do not want to

777
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,839
redo

778
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,000
rfc 8280

779
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,920
so that we want a really like

780
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,480
practicable document and not

781
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,640
re-establish the whole theory the whole

782
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,320
history of

783
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,119
human rights the interrelation between

784
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,280
human rights and protocols because if we

785
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,200
start to redo that then we'll have

786
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,520
another 80 page document and we'll not

787
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,760
get to the guidelines right but i very

788
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,320
much understand that we need that we

789
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,800
could um

790
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,920
[Music]

791
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,160
that that human rights are implemented

792
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,560
differently but i think we really also

793
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,800
chose this research group to be about

794
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
human rights to ensure that we do not

795
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,839
need to compare the 194 different

796
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,440
regulations in all the countries of the

797
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,480
world but use the most widely shared

798
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,160
norm there is and that countries have

799
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,960
subscribed to and therefore focus on

800
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,720
human rights and how they are translated

801
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,280
but we can definitely add a sentence to

802
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,040
make clear that they are explained

803
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,359
differently in different jurisdictions

804
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,880
and uh

805
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,119
i think it needs more than more than a

806
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,760
sentence here

807
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,280
the you know

808
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,400
reading this i i'm not actually

809
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,240
without doing a bunch of further reading

810
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,640
understanding what right the document is

811
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,960
talking about or how they translate into

812
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,400
something concrete

813
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,640
so i agree you can

814
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,480
look at all of the different

815
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,320
um

816
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,760
you know all of the different countries

817
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,280
and how these are interpreted in all the

818
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,720
different countries because yeah

819
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,720
obviously that's a multi-hundred page

820
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,400
sort of uh

821
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,000
legal essay um but i think some you know

822
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,520
being you know going through the right

823
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,040
thing a little bit about what's meant by

824
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,240
each one giving a couple of examples uh

825
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,560
about each one is

826
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,560
important to make it clear to the

827
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,720
readers who are not steeped in the human

828
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,960
rights culture what's being talked about

829
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,119
here

830
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,640
so

831
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,400
we need to explain

832
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,599
the rights

833
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,760
explain how the rights

834
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,079
are connecting to

835
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,440
technology

836
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,240
or

837
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,640
how they connect how they are translated

838
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,400
to different jurisdictions because these

839
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,240
are also three huge different fields

840
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,479
right

841
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,800
um so i mean just just reading the

842
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,760
the the

843
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,640
the documentary it talks about

844
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,680
human

845
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,560
i mean section two sort of lists uh a

846
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,160
bunch of rights uh but it says very very

847
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,680
little about what each of those mean and

848
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,520
um

849
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,560
you know

850
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,640
what their practical impact on on

851
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,359
anything is

852
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,000
um so yeah as you know i i can look at

853
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,079
that list and i i can guess what it

854
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,520
might mean

855
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,960
but i'd have to guess what it might

856
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,480
means and what

857
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,640
because i don't have that background and

858
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,440
i think most people in you know

859
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,200
developing protocols don't have that

860
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,119
background in in understanding what

861
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,800
people mean when they talk about these

862
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,440
various rights and what that actually

863
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,599
means in practice so rather than having

864
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,760
people guess what's intended i think it

865
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,000
needs a some text in here to say okay

866
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,560
this is what it means and for example

867
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,040
it translates into

868
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,359
you know whatever set of laws in this

869
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,960
country i mean obviously not in all

870
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,079
countries because that's that's a

871
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,839
ludicrous amount but

872
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,119
you know if you're talking about the you

873
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,119
know protecting personal data then it

874
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,119
would be useful for example to mention

875
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,599
that that you know that gets uh

876
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,160
interpreted as the gdpr in in europe for

877
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,200
example

878
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,520
so and i'm sure that a bunch of places

879
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,040
or if it doesn't this is just showing

880
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,359
that that you know this needs something

881
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,160
there's some confusion here but you know

882
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,640
it needs just a few words i think to try

883
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,160
and make it a bit more concrete

884
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,280
okay but i think i think what we

885
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,640
really try to do with the work is try to

886
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,400
focus on human rights and once we start

887
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,359
treading

888
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,760
into national regulations and into

889
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,160
policies of different countries

890
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,320
then things become much murkier right

891
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,079
and that that was also the strategic and

892
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,320
the tactical discussion that's also in

893
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,359
the charter so i'm i'm i'm a bit

894
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,520
but i'll definitely try to to hint to

895
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,640
that how

896
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,320
as examples

897
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,280
but

898
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,040
making that part of a structural piece

899
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,200
of the study i think would be uh would

900
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,400
be opening us up for far more work and i

901
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,640
think like to establish the relationship

902
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,119
between different rights

903
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,960
and technologies

904
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,880
we've outlined several cases in rfc 8280

905
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,119
to establish the uh

906
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,720
the relationship

907
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,640
and i'm not sure we would want to do

908
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,960
that again in this document because for

909
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,640
instance draft association which is

910
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,880
another document really goes that into

911
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,839
depth

912
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:12,640
to

913
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,319
dive into

914
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,920
what one of these rights means and that

915
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,520
would then be a whole document so i'm

916
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,560
also a bit like what do we fit where and

917
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,640
do we have a kitchen sink approach and

918
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,560
what do we try to do in which documents

919
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,839
so

920
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,520
and guidelines are really like what's

921
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,599
the guidelines documents but i would

922
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,560
definitely

923
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,160
say that there can points to other

924
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,319
documents can point to other literature

925
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,160
and point to other things but trying to

926
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,720
do that work in this document might then

927
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,359
distract from the actual

928
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,520
objective of the document yeah okay i

929
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,440
mean that that's fair and and it may be

930
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,599
that what this needs is something

931
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,680
relatively brief and a bunch of pointers

932
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,560
um

933
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,160
but you know all i'm saying is is that

934
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,920
reading this as someone who doesn't have

935
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
that human rights background i i got you

936
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,359
know i can guess what's being meant but

937
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,520
i didn't know uh and i think having to

938
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,359
guess what's meant is is not helpful

939
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,960
and that's that's

940
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:08,960
yeah

941
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,200
just a couple reactions from a broad

942
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,720
overview of the group i think um on the

943
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,960
one hand in figuring out how to sign

944
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,400
posts to different drafts i mean

945
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,920
guidelines definitely should point back

946
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,400
to 80 280 that's where it goes into

947
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,240
depth and guidelines is meant to be sort

948
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,400
of like a a re

949
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,079
uh

950
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,720
it's just it's actually just a rev

951
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,960
a different version of 8280 but in a

952
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,359
more practical way so that's one that we

953
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,960
need but we need to bring out the

954
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,400
salient points and i think we've

955
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,560
actually had that discussion i'm happy

956
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,640
with where it's at on that level but

957
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,200
then specifically to

958
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,000
the question of national laws i think in

959
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
the past we've because this came up

960
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,359
actually um not long ago sandra raised

961
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,640
it there was quite a prolonged

962
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,880
discussion on the list and we did i

963
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,720
think determined that it was out of

964
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,040
scope but i think what you're saying

965
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,119
colin which is i think useful feedback

966
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,200
is that for someone who's reading this

967
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,599
document and trying to glean

968
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,560
knowledge from it to do better in making

969
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,240
these trade-offs um around

970
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,160
decision-making it might actually be

971
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,880
helpful to get that guidance um not in

972
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,640
the specific i don't think it would be

973
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,160
helpful actually even to look at you

974
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,079
know the big countries with the big laws

975
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,520
i think we shouldn't do that i think

976
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,240
what we should say then instead is

977
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,480
here's an approach you can take

978
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,560
to just make sure you know if it's and

979
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,079
it's not going to be for all sections

980
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,720
but certainly for like data privacy or

981
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,800
other things there's going to be a need

982
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
to suggest to people

983
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,599
um to look at any applicable laws and

984
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,400
since

985
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,800
it's tends to be glo like we're building

986
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,000
global

987
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,079
protocols protocols that are meant to be

988
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,400
rolled out not in any particular country

989
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,720
it's worth i think nodding at that as

990
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,760
part of the process um because also i

991
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,599
think niels and this is maybe a

992
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,119
departure from the discussion we've had

993
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,480
in the past is that there is a path to

994
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,720
achieving compliance with human rights

995
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,160
through national laws because

996
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,079
governments are um accountable and

997
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,000
responsible for doing that they're you

998
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,040
know signed

999
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,800
signatories to the

1000
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,680
um human rights declaration so it's not

1001
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,599
out of the realm of possibility that

1002
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,520
that would actually be a useful thing i

1003
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,200
just don't think we need to elaborate on

1004
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,319
it because

1005
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,720
um of all the reasons we mentioned right

1006
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,800
because it you know it's it's slightly

1007
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,400
out of scope from our charter that's not

1008
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,160
the reason i'm leaning into right now

1009
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,000
it's it's just that there's maybe too

1010
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,520
many um

1011
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,000
countries to consider um we're rolling

1012
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,319
out global protocols and also

1013
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,480
um they will change over time and so

1014
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,400
just baking it into the process i think

1015
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,440
is the suggested change maybe that would

1016
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,920
be an opportunity to point

1017
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,760
um protocol developers in the right

1018
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,760
direction as far as

1019
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,040
compliance on specifically the kinds of

1020
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,720
privacy and other kinds of laws that

1021
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,720
would actually matter

1022
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,560
yeah it just seems quite abstract the

1023
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,880
way it's written and you know i know a

1024
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,119
lot of this has gotten reflected in more

1025
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,800
concrete terms and it's just i think

1026
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,560
probably be useful to to the people

1027
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,240
actually building the protocols to make

1028
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,598
it a little more concrete

1029
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,400
yeah and so for rights

1030
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,000
that are going to have

1031
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,240
a counterpart in national law it might

1032
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,079
be useful to say that it's not going to

1033
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,480
be for all of the rights

1034
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,160
um

1035
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,520
great thank you for the um

1036
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,599
overview of your feedback colin and

1037
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,440
thanks very much niels for engaging on

1038
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,280
that i think actually the bulk of

1039
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,680
that work is going to happen on the list

1040
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,359
right niels and gershwat are going to

1041
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,760
digest all that feedback come out with a

1042
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,839
new version ask questions where they

1043
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,440
need to clarify your

1044
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,160
review and then we'll aim to move that

1045
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,119
draft forward so thanks to you both

1046
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,000
sure i mean if it's useful to have a

1047
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,720
chat with the authors about this

1048
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,480
then i'm very happy to arrange that

1049
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,119
excellent thanks so much

1050
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,920
good um niels i wonder if you wanted to

1051
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,240
um stay up here with me in gallery view

1052
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,760
for a second because i want to ask you

1053
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,079
about what's happening with draft

1054
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,839
association or if you wanted to

1055
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,200
um any updates or thoughts about what's

1056
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,439
next

1057
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,720
yeah so i think draft association has

1058
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,560
done a lot of the things that the

1059
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,960
research group has asked it to

1060
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,440
and um

1061
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,040
uh once again i went through the whole

1062
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,680
list and uh couldn't find any other

1063
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,520
things anymore so i think it's currently

1064
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,720
in the waiting uh line for a document

1065
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,839
shepard

1066
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,359
so uh

1067
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,040
i hope that once it gets a document

1068
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,720
shepard it will uh maybe

1069
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,319
receive just such an excellent review as

1070
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,359
draft guidelines has gotten and then we

1071
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,720
can also move that document forward and

1072
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,599
then we hopefully we kind of cleaned up

1073
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,839
some space for uh some fresh new

1074
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,319
documents

1075
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,000
so yeah so if there is a uh

1076
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,920
someone who has followed the discussion

1077
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,560
on draft association and wants to help

1078
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,800
it get to the uh

1079
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,319
to the finish line

1080
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,640
please uh please make yourself known and

1081
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,598
happy to work with you

1082
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,319
and to be clear about why we need a

1083
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,599
document shepherd because i'm a

1084
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,240
co-author and um i'm the only coat i'm

1085
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,839
the only chair at the moment so we just

1086
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,079
need somebody else to come in um in my

1087
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,760
view both as

1088
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,000
chair and a co-author it's in a really

1089
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,319
good place we had um

1090
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,560
now it's been a year and a half i think

1091
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,400
since we've completed

1092
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,680
a real overhaul um led by

1093
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,800
uh stefan couture through um sort of

1094
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,960
redoing the literature review coming up

1095
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,839
with sub questions coming up with cases

1096
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,880
that address the sub questions so

1097
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,680
um

1098
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,040
and it hasn't

1099
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,960
it hasn't become controversial on the

1100
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,079
list i think there's actually quite a

1101
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,680
lot of support and a lot of um past

1102
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,400
discussion that indicates the draft is

1103
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,240
in a really solid place so it would be

1104
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,680
actually quite straightforward for

1105
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,359
somebody who

1106
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,560
would like to be a document shepard even

1107
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,200
if you're new to doing um

1108
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,440
shepherding that would be fine but we

1109
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,880
would really appreciate some extra

1110
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,880
participation so that we can take the

1111
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,839
next step with this draft

1112
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,599
go ahead

1113
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,359
yeah just just follow up on that the

1114
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,000
role of the the shepherd in in the irtf

1115
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,960
process is is just is primarily to

1116
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,200
document the consensus

1117
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,680
of the draft and and to

1118
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,680
um help make sure it gets through the

1119
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,440
review process

1120
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,319
um so so the the primary you know the

1121
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,880
primary effect here is is doing a

1122
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,000
uh a

1123
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,839
review of the draft and the discussion

1124
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,839
and writing up you know the extent to

1125
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,599
which there has been consensus and

1126
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,440
agreement and disagreement on on the

1127
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,559
list

1128
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,920
and in the group

1129
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,319
um and then just working with me and

1130
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:09,280
with the the irst to just make sure that

1131
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,599
review happens and chasing people up to

1132
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,200
follow up on review comments and things

1133
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,160
like that

1134
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,240
so it's it's not an especially onerous

1135
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,240
role

1136
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,559
and it's a it's a draft that's very

1137
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,480
explicitly listed in our charter in the

1138
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,559
sense that we are you know we've done

1139
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,200
the sort of broad human rights work with

1140
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,640
8280 and the guidelines draft um but the

1141
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,960
human rights to freedom of association

1142
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,280
and assembly is listed specifically so

1143
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,400
it's a really important i think

1144
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,720
cornerstone of our group go ahead niels

1145
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,520
i promise i won't need a lot of chasing

1146
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,599
so uh just to make

1147
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,160
things easier

1148
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,160
okay excellent

1149
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,400
all right i think that is uh that is all

1150
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,640
for our updates um i

1151
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,599
um

1152
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:00,960
did exactly what i thought i was gonna

1153
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,680
do was just forget to beg somebody to do

1154
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,520
note taking on this so we'll probably

1155
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,440
just have to watch this

1156
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,440
next week and write up the notes

1157
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,520
um so this is the only portion of the

1158
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,880
meeting i think where we need to have

1159
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,119
notes except for maybe after i present

1160
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,960
on draft feminism so

1161
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,960
anyway with that i think we're at a good

1162
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,640
place to

1163
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,839
shift

1164
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:25,839
uh let me put the agenda back up again

1165
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,920
um

1166
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,440
so we've we've taken care of one

1167
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,839
and five we don't have any in any other

1168
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,680
business and sasha's unable to present

1169
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,720
so it's just up to honor yet now who um

1170
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,200
can go ahead um put yourself on camera

00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,440
um is that the correct slide

1188
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,640
does it have the the slide number one

1189
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,720

1193
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,839
unfortunately i can't move this

1194
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,400
i had it in presentation mode is that

1195
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,800
better

1196
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,079
yeah now that it's in the first slide

1197
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,800
okay great

1198
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,440
so apologies again everyone but i won't

1199
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,520
dwell on it and thanks so much for

1200
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,920
inviting me i've been following your

1201
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,000
work for many years

1202
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,599
um from a distance although i've

1203
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,599
attended some of the sessions at icann

1204
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:48,880
meetings

1205
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,839
and um i'm just very happy to be here

1206
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:55,119
so i'm andrew esterhosen i'm currently

1207
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,960
the chair of the internet governance

1208
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,800
forum multi-stakeholder advisory

1209
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,680
committee until the end of this year

1210
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,319
and i want to talk to you about the igf

1211
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,599
so

1212
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,839
i'll go a little bit into the background

1213
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,520
and mallory is that the correct slide

1214
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,839
now is that the one that says outcome of

1215
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,720
the world summit

1216
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,680
yes that's great right

1217
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,160
so so the igf and i know many of you

1218
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,559
have been part of the igf in at one

1219
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,800
point or another

1220
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,920
it's this fairly unique kind of creature

1221
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,079
in the sense that it is an outcome of a

1222
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,720
formal united nations process

1223
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,400
the world summit on the information

1224
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,599
society

1225
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,559
um in 2005

1226
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,559
and but it's not part of a un process in

1227
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,280
a very rigid or strict way so it's

1228
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,520
connected to the u.n it's bound by some

1229
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,400
of the u.n bureaucracy and protocols but

1230
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,640
it also has a life of its own because it

1231
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,400
has evolved

1232
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,760
into

1233
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,000
initially an event but now more of a

1234
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,400
process that is organized by a

1235
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,559
multi-stakeholder advisory group the

1236
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,040
group i chair which is appointed by the

1237
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,079
un secretary general

1238
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,480
and there is a secretariat which is part

1239
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,880
of the un they they sit inside the uan

1240
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,440
division for economic and social affairs

1241
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,680
but really the igf is shaped by the

1242
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,839
community by the people that run

1243
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:22,559
sessions that participate in sessions

1244
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,200
that submit input on what should be the

1245
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,920
agenda of the igf so the bottom-up

1246
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,640
approach has actually been very

1247
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,680
firmly established in the igf

1248
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,000
and sometimes there is tension between

1249
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,680
this bottom-up approach and the more

1250
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,200
bureaucratic um un system approach but

1251
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,760
somehow it kind of works

1252
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,520
and it has evolved over time this is the

1253
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,480
15th anniversary of the igf 2021

1254
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,960
and the renewal of the igf mandate by

1255
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,000
member states um will be reconsidered in

1256
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,880
2025. and that in itself is actually

1257
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,839
quite um significant because the igf

1258
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:07,040
um does not actually control its own

1259
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:11,200
destiny and not entirely anyway

1260
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,760
it's very much linked to this definition

1261
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,599
of internet governance

1262
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,599
which i know avery is in the room with

1263
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,760
us she was a member of the working group

1264
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,640
on internet governance the wiki a group

1265
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,400
which between 2003 and 2005

1266
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,200
um

1267
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,280
investigated explored internet

1268
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,480
governance and how it should be

1269
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,559
approached and they came up with this

1270
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,599
definition which i find very interesting

1271
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,960
because it is so broad and it was in in

1272
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,799
a sense a counterpoint

1273
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,960
to what at the time

1274
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,280
were the prevailing more technical

1275
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,839
definitions of internet governance

1276
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:49,680
focused on the coordination and the

1277
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,319
technical management of the internet and

1278
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,799
this definition i'll just read the last

1279
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,920
phrase um looks at norm's rules

1280
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,640
decision-making procedures and programs

1281
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,520
that shape the evolution and use of the

1282
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,599
internet so it's really very soundly um

1283
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,880
focusing in on that constantly growing

1284
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,799
space um

1285
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,119
of people and and the internet being

1286
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,280
shaped by people and interacting with

1287
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,359
people

1288
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,839
and just to talk about human rights just

1289
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,000
very briefly because i know this is this

1290
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
is part of the work that you've been

1291
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,920
doing has been trying to put human

1292
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,040
rights on the agenda in a space

1293
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:31,920
that

1294
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,799
was not necessarily initially designed

1295
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:37,119
or that didn't anticipate that should

1296
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,520
prioritize human rights and actually

1297
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,119
this also applied to the igf um it's

1298
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:45,599
been quite a long and elaborate struggle

1299
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,640
to get human rights recognis recognized

1300
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,599
as an important topic at the igf

1301
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,599
probably it's taken about 10 years at

1302
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,720
least it was covered very broadly under

1303
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,880
one of the main themes of the idea of

1304
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,559
the historical main themes openness

1305
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,640
but it has been difficult to get more

1306
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,359
in-depth discussion on human rights

1307
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,319
there was a fear um from some of the igf

1308
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,880
supporters that if we put human rights

1309
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,280
on the igf's agenda some governments

1310
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,680
would lose interest or they would they

1311
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,839
would withdraw report or even that the

1312
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:21,359
private sector might not be that

1313
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:22,720
interested

1314
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,440
and the same applies to gender issues um

1315
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,599
it's taken a long time and quite a lot

1316
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,319
of assertiveness from the bottom up to

1317
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,319
get these issues recognized as

1318
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:36,240
legitimate internet governance topics

1319
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,799
and so to tell you a bit about the mag

1320
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,960
that's the multi-stakeholder advisory

1321
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,760
group

1322
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,079
and the context that we've worked with

1323
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,880
this year has been um

1324
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,359
really the pandemic has been

1325
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:52,559
a major concern in 2020 we had a fully

1326
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,280
virtual igf which was much easier to

1327
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,520
organize than the hybrid igf we're doing

1328
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,799
this year

1329
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:02,160
but it has also heightened awareness of

1330
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,240
the internet and the importance of

1331
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,520
internet policy frameworks that that

1332
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,839
prioritize access particularly access

1333
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:12,880
for those that are excluded from access

1334
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,640
and that are impacted on it so

1335
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,839
incredibly profoundly in the context of

1336
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:19,359
the pandemic

1337
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,160
the other factor that's been a big issue

1338
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,079
for us this year is the u.n secretary

1339
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,559
general's roadmap for digital

1340
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,640
cooperation

1341
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,200
and papers and proposals from various

1342
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,520
governments that emerge from that the

1343
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,400
pending renewal of the mandate and the

1344
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,799
fact that internet governance in itself

1345
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:42,160
is is continuously changing and growing

1346
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,520
it's no longer a set of processes that

1347
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,240
you can you know define as sitting

1348
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,880
inside icann the igf

1349
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,160
uh maybe the international

1350
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,799
telecommunications union and internet

1351
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:56,960
governance has just proliferated and

1352
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,760
there are spaces at national global and

1353
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,920
regional level that deal with various

1354
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,920
internet related um

1355
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,720
policy um issues and and we need to

1356
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,760
somehow still find a way for the igf to

1357
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,480
be the connector the common space that

1358
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,319
brings all the all those different

1359
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,400
forums together

1360
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,040
um just our goals have been to be more

1361
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,200
uh inclusive that's always a goal for

1362
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,079
the igf to remain relevant to be more

1363
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,119
focused and impact oriented and to

1364
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,680
integrate all the different activities

1365
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,920
that are are now part of the igf

1366
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,760
ecosystem and i'll say a bit more about

1367
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,760
that

1368
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,559
the this year's igf and i invite you all

1369
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,040
to participate it's free and it's open

1370
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,240
there are more than 200 um sessions

1371
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,640
of different nature different kinds of

1372
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,559
sessions some are more formal some are

1373
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,599
more informal and but what i think is

1374
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,040
really interesting you know are the

1375
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,119
topics that will be discussed they're

1376
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,559
only two main issue areas um economic

1377
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:00,880
and social inclusion and human rights

1378
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,240
and universal and meaningful access and

1379
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,480
for each of those there are a set of

1380
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,119
policy questions which which emerged

1381
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,760
from the community input we received

1382
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,559
and the workshops and other sessions at

1383
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,920
the igf will try to respond to some of

1384
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,440
these challenges

1385
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,359
and then there are four cross-cutting

1386
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,520
areas emerging regulation

1387
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,599
from content regulation

1388
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,839
to antitrust regulation it's just

1389
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,920
increasingly a topic that needs to be

1390
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,880
discussed it comes with risks

1391
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,799
it needs to be approached with caution

1392
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,440
but it also needs to be considered as

1393
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,680
something i mean i heard you talk about

1394
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,319
data privacy earlier for example

1395
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:45,200
trust security security and stability

1396
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,200
environment and climate change and i

1397
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,440
actually want to bring that up because

1398
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,280
there's a proposal on the table for

1399
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,760
environmental impact assessments to

1400
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,400
become part of internet governance and

1401
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,799
then digital cooperation that's the sort

1402
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:00,720
of bigger picture the whole sort of

1403
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,720
metaverse of

1404
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,799
of internet governance and digital

1405
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,280
cooperation the multi-stakeholder and

1406
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,559
the multilateral bits of it

1407
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:13,119
the idea is not just a conference so

1408
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,440
that's that's always important it has

1409
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,960
these different

1410
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,119
components and different modalities

1411
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,680
which are all very bottom up and you can

1412
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,000
all participate in them there are two

1413
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,480
policy networks one on environment one

1414
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,119
on universal and meaningful access

1415
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,599
there are 20 plus dynamic coalitions

1416
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,920
ranging from looking at issues like

1417
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,079
platform regulation to gender um to

1418
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:40,319
community connectivity

1419
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:43,359
there are more than 140 national and

1420
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:46,160
regional and youth igfs there's this

1421
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,480
newly announced leadership panel in fact

1422
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,559
there's a call for nominations that went

1423
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,079
out yesterday

1424
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,240
and there's the mag and the mag has

1425
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,960
working groups and while the mag members

1426
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,520
are appointed by the secretary general

1427
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,520
the working groups are open to anyone

1428
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,079
who's interested the secretariat the

1429
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,200
staff the u.n division of economic and

1430
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,960
social affairs that's the most

1431
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,359
affordable component but then there's

1432
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:13,440
the igf community and and it's really

1433
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,480
quite vast you know we had in 2020 we

1434
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,280
had nearly 7 000 participants in the igf

1435
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,319
process

1436
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:23,520
and that's really the life of the igf

1437
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,680
um just quickly to mention you might be

1438
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,680
interested they're two best practice

1439
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,359
forums this year

1440
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:32,640
these are communities that work together

1441
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,960
to do some research and they generate a

1442
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,520
report one on norms

1443
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,440
in cyber security

1444
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,200
and understanding how they work

1445
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,040
effectively

1446
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,319
to mitigate adverse cybersecurity events

1447
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,079
and then one looking at gendered

1448
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,599
misinformation and disinformation and

1449
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,920
looking at practices and tools and

1450
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,400
policies that can help build a less

1451
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,359
toxic environment for female and gender

1452
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:02,880
diverse groups in the online space

1453
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,440
okay i'm kind of at the end just the

1454
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,160
internet governance um is the internet

1455
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,240
governance forum is at a bit of a

1456
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,319
critical juncture in the sense that the

1457
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:15,039
mandate renewal is coming up it's being

1458
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:18,000
challenged by the un secretary general

1459
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,440
um to be more output-oriented

1460
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,480
um

1461
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,200
and there's also a concern that in fact

1462
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,039
maybe the igf shouldn't be so

1463
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:29,599
output-oriented that it should focus on

1464
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:32,640
deliberation and discourse on being a

1465
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,559
place for discussion not a place for

1466
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:37,119
negotiation there are also exciting

1467
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,839
opportunities in particular there's this

1468
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,359
common agenda

1469
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:43,200
published by the united nations

1470
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,520
secretary general in september

1471
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,480
and it emphasizes the global digital

1472
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,760
comments

1473
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,400
and this could be an opportunity in fact

1474
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,200
for for looking at the internet as such

1475
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,839
a digital commons and putting some

1476
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:01,119
principles on the table

1477
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,119
along the lines of the internet being

1478
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:05,200
governed and internet governance needing

1479
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,880
to be underpinned

1480
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,960
by these principles of the internet as a

1481
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,920
digital um commons and but that of

1482
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,240
course um will take a lot of debate and

1483
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,480
there'll be a lot of of

1484
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,559
different perspectives on that and then

1485
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:20,799
the igf as a process and institution

1486
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:24,319
also needs to to strengthen um in order

1487
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:26,799
to to continue to evolve

1488
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:29,119
so really i'm i'm looking forward to

1489
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,200
your questions i just wanted to to

1490
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,520
reflect that i think there'd be value in

1491
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,440
some collaboration between yourselves

1492
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,799
and the igf

1493
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:39,920
or for you to come in fact as you are to

1494
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,240
the idea to share some of your

1495
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,039
experiences in fact i think the idea of

1496
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,640
impact assessments and how they can work

1497
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,960
better how they work well

1498
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,319
um so a kind of lessons learning or best

1499
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,720
practice good practice gathering

1500
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,960
on impact assessments could be very

1501
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,280
useful and from the perspective of human

1502
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,240
rights impact perspectives but also from

1503
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,160
from the perspective of these proposed

1504
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:09,440
environmental um impact assessments

1505
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,680
um there's also a discussion about the

1506
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,839
human rights based approach to internet

1507
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:16,559
governance and so they're different

1508
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,319
modalities we could form a dynamic

1509
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:20,880
coalition we could just have a bilateral

1510
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,480
but i i do hope that that your work can

1511
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,839
continue to be and become more visible

1512
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:30,240
at the ig event if there any ways in

1513
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,240
which you think the igf can support your

1514
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,559
work let's talk about it back to you

1515
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,119
mallory

1516
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,400
thanks henriette um

1517
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,119
really it's a great presentation i have

1518
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:46,880
i can talk with you all day about this i

1519
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,200
wish that we could do that um

1520
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,000
but i want other people from

1521
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,039
um

1522
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:56,400
the participants to ask um

1523
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,720
if there are questions if um folks are

1524
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,280
familiar with the igf if you've been

1525
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,839
what your assessment is

1526
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:06,240
um i think yeah andrea is the expert in

1527
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,839
the room right now on this

1528
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:15,279
i'm trying to stop sharing

1529
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,880
stuff if you'd like to um i don't know

1530
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,039
before you had your camera going unreal

1531
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:22,640
but we didn't see anything we just saw

1532
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,799
black swear if that's how you like it

1533
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,880
that's fine um but just inviting you if

1534
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,079
you want to

1535
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:29,680
put your camera i'd be happy here i've

1536
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,359
just been kind of switched but it's dark

1537
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:33,680
here i need to switch the light off but

1538
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,079
please let's i'll i'll do that but let's

1539
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:38,319
just get the the questions going in the

1540
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:41,839
meantime andrew go ahead

1541
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,119
all right uh thank you and uh always

1542
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,119
good to get the background on the on the

1543
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:48,839
uh

1544
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:52,079
igf so thanks for the presentation

1545
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,400
and yet just turning your your last

1546
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,559
point back on its head

1547
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:59,359
um i think it will be fantastic to get

1548
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:01,599
uh more participants from the igf

1549
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,799
involved in the

1550
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,760
because we could really do with a lot

1551
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,240
more input from people with a better

1552
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,880
understanding of the policy implications

1553
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,319
of standards decisions

1554
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:17,839
i'm sure not everyone in the itf would

1555
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:19,520
agree with me on that but um i think

1556
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:22,400
we'd end up with better better standards

1557
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,200
uh if we understood the the real world

1558
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,480
impact of some of the choices uh being

1559
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,839
made

1560
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:31,119
but other than that i'm really looking

1561
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:33,920
forward to uh in-person participation in

1562
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,839
poland in a few weeks time which will be

1563
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:37,039
fantastic

1564
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:38,960
thank you absolutely andrew there is

1565
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,960
actually a dynamic coalition on

1566
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,160
standards

1567
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,280
that is it was initiated by a guy called

1568
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,119
de natris i don't know if you followed

1569
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:48,559
that work

1570
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:51,599
it was relatively um

1571
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:54,000
it it operated as a kind of standalone

1572
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,839
project at some point

1573
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:56,720
um

1574
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,880
but now it's a self-organized community

1575
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,480
of practice

1576
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,119
i'm not sure if any of the of the itf

1577
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,359
people are involved in that but i

1578
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,039
absolutely agree with you and i think

1579
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,280
that that in fact in the early days of

1580
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,559
the igf there was more conversation and

1581
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:14,480
i've read i wonder if you even remember

1582
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,680
that

1583
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,319
there was more focus on standards in the

1584
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:21,280
early period of the igf and than there

1585
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,400
is now

1586
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,960
and so and i andrew i think it's very

1587
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,720
important to have that kind of cross

1588
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,280
virtualization the the bigger picture

1589
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,720
perspective

1590
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,440
along with the specificity the the

1591
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,920
specific technical um

1592
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,680
detail that you have to deal with in the

1593
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,839
standards process so yeah that's uh it

1594
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:43,720
is important i agree

1595
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,440
but for example we have um you know

1596
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,760
human rights protocol considerations

1597
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,960
group that is um

1598
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:54,640
not working as well you can hear my

1599
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,799
audio right um

1600
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,079
i can hear you

1601
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:58,880
good

1602
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,680
the platform is lying to me um yeah i

1603
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,760
the i think the other one you mentioned

1604
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,920
too is the best practice forum on cyber

1605
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,000
security and i've also been engaged in

1606
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,119
that for a while and it i think um a lot

1607
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:12,720
of folks who

1608
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,960
helped me with my research projects in

1609
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,238
that group

1610
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:18,238
um could could apply those here it's

1611
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,040
just

1612
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,719
they're not it's not always so very

1613
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:22,640
technical but for example like this year

1614
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,198
um i've had a team researching

1615
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:26,479
how um

1616
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:28,319
internet security events could have

1617
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,399
maybe been

1618
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,399
mitigated differently if

1619
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:33,839
whether or not

1620
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:35,439
um international norms would have

1621
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:37,359
actually made a difference

1622
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:40,080
um so we'll see but it could be similar

1623
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,560
to i think um work in in irtf around

1624
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,880
um you know could these practices have

1625
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,719
been different looking in the past at

1626
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:51,359
different things

1627
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,479
um so simon hicks has mentioned in the

1628
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:56,319
chat um that the

1629
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,000
the large players from the ietf haven't

1630
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,238
been involved i think that's not always

1631
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:02,238
true i don't know about this year but in

1632
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,560
the past i know the ietf has

1633
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,238
hosted um a forum

1634
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:11,040
an open forum open forum is a

1635
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,920
a workshop style or a session style

1636
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,960
where um a body this goes to the igf as

1637
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,040
being a sort of connector so if you are

1638
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,560
representing

1639
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,399
you know another sort of internet

1640
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:24,080
governance body you can hold an open

1641
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,759
forum in which

1642
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:27,839
people participants come to learn about

1643
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:30,560
your body and then um you can have

1644
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,479
questions and answers and i think folks

1645
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:34,158
from the iab have done that in the past

1646
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:35,920
but i don't know actually it's on the

1647
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,960
schedule for poland

1648
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,719
um

1649
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:42,479
there are lots of open forums i think

1650
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,319
there are about 40 different open forums

1651
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,279
i'm not sure who is um

1652
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:50,319
i don't think the itf is presenting one

1653
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,238
but but that is a modality that you can

1654
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:55,120
use and and in fact there's there's also

1655
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,120
what we've tried to do is make the igf

1656
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,719
more flexible

1657
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:00,560
and uh

1658
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,400
the one of the the

1659
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,719
forms of organizing a session during the

1660
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:07,280
igf as a networking session and that

1661
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,760
remains open in fact one could apply now

1662
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,800
for a networking session on on a

1663
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,440
particular topic you could for example

1664
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,520
during the igf

1665
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,840
organize a networking session on

1666
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,120
standards

1667
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,679
and you know do during a lunch break and

1668
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:26,480
just invite everyone who's at the igf

1669
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:29,040
who cares about standards um to come

1670
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,280
together and and share their reflections

1671
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,440
on whether you know the policy people

1672
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,920
understand standards or not um for

1673
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,400
example

1674
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,719
yes and colin is saying um that the ice

1675
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:45,360
the internet society is internet society

1676
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,360
is running an open forum

1677
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,239
they they're talking uh specifically

1678
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:53,360
about their internet way of net you know

1679
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,760
the internet way of networking their

1680
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:56,800
approach

1681
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,640
at the moment which they've been working

1682
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,239
with which is to apply apply um the

1683
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:04,000
interoperability

1684
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,120
um

1685
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,600
of internet protocols and how the

1686
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,000
internet operates as an interconnected

1687
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,800
network to policy making so it's

1688
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,560
interesting they had sessions on this

1689
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,239
last year as well but they are

1690
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:20,400
definitely running an open forum on that

1691
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,080
i can download

1692
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,120
there's not one for the iab or the ietf

1693
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,320
um i also heard w3c talking about doing

1694
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,080
one but i don't see

1695
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:38,640
i don't think wc3 applied in the end

1696
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,719
but there is a yeah no i don't think

1697
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:42,800
they did they are participating in the

1698
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,360
dynamic coalition on accessibility and

1699
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,480
disability so they might be

1700
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,040
participating

1701
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,600
uh in that session with the standards

1702
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,600
with their recently uh released

1703
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,520
standards on accessibility

1704
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,080
i i'm going to jump into my question

1705
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,080
since there's no one else in the queue

1706
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,480
so one of my questions um i have two

1707
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,760
actually the first is about the

1708
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,600
leadership panel that you mentioned has

1709
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,640
just been

1710
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,360
the open call has gone around um as of

1711
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,640
yesterday

1712
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,080
because it lists

1713
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,400
various criteria for who

1714
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,880
uh how there will be um

1715
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,880
stakeholder participation so they've

1716
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,199
held two slots

1717
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:26,640
for the technical community for a

1718
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,400
representative or senior director

1719
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,920
position of the technical community do

1720
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,280
you know how that's been defined and how

1721
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,600
they plan on

1722
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,199
i would i would assume there would need

1723
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:40,480
to be outreach to the you know iab or

1724
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,360
other people who are in a position of

1725
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,400
leadership within different sdos do you

1726
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,199
know how they're going to go about that

1727
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:51,600
i think i know what you know which is in

1728
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,199
the document um on the igf website which

1729
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:57,280
has the nomination process and the terms

1730
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,560
of reference

1731
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,000
um but yes i think they are looking for

1732
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:02,840
for

1733
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,520
um o c and leadership

1734
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,560
two people from each stakeholder groups

1735
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,480
uh each stakeholder group and then they

1736
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,120
have these two at large uh positions as

1737
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,000
well

1738
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,760
so you know i think it really is

1739
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,400
important that one makes nominations

1740
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,960
um and that you motivate you know that

1741
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,880
you're looking at people i i mean

1742
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,719
personally i think it's not enough just

1743
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:27,199
to be a ceo of an international

1744
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:30,000
technical organization you also need to

1745
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,920
be someone that's willing to put in the

1746
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:32,800
time

1747
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,040
and and engage with the space because

1748
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,719
what would be the role

1749
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:39,360
of technical community leadership on

1750
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,000
that igf leadership panel the role would

1751
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,360
be to bring the igf community um closer

1752
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,360
to to the technical community and vice

1753
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,560
versa

1754
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,080
um

1755
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,960
so um it would be important you know for

1756
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,960
it to be people that that actually have

1757
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,480
the interest and the capacity and the

1758
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,840
time to play that kind of role

1759
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,320
one consideration is that there aren't

1760
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,400
as far as i know there's not a lot of

1761
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,280
mechanisms either in the itf or even

1762
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,920
icann or w3c around

1763
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,400
appointments on behalf of

1764
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,480
a technical community that's why i found

1765
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,640
it like an interesting inclusion but if

1766
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,040
because the i think the term in the

1767
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,719
technical community's liaison right

1768
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:23,120
you're like the liaison

1769
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,199
you know icann and the itf or you're the

1770
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:28,080
liaison between the itu and the ietf you

1771
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,880
would be the liaison between the ietf

1772
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,840
and the igf but not that you're actually

1773
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,400
representing not just the body that

1774
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,320
you're a leader in you're representing

1775
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,480
the whole technical community so if

1776
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,400
there are two slots and let's say you

1777
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,040
know someone from the itu-t

1778
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,719
and then someone from

1779
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:48,560
you know the ieee

1780
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,159
are appointed they're actually

1781
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:53,280
responsible for connecting all these

1782
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,280
sdos so it's just a bit you know it's

1783
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,800
it's actually kind of a tall order and

1784
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,280
i'm not sure

1785
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,320
it's a very true order

1786
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,719
you know i i think it is

1787
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:06,640
there's a rotation the terms are two

1788
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:07,920
years

1789
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:08,800
um

1790
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,199
i think i wouldn't even go as far as

1791
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:13,199
calling it a representation i don't

1792
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:15,280
think you can represent the entire

1793
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,320
technical community in its diversity

1794
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,400
with two people

1795
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,520
i think that applies to the other

1796
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,440
stakeholders as well you know but i

1797
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,600
think that that you know maybe if it's

1798
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:26,880
the iab

1799
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,440
you know it and if it's if it's if it's

1800
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,760
if it's the iatf maybe that will bring a

1801
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:35,840
particular perspective um um maybe

1802
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,800
two years later it can be isoc maybe it

1803
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,719
can be someone completely different

1804
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:42,719
somebody who is outside of the

1805
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,360
institutional framework but very deeply

1806
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,520
embedded in the development of the

1807
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,320
internet um i think it is a tour order

1808
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,159
but i wouldn't aim for perfect

1809
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:53,679
representativity

1810
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:56,000
i would really aim for someone with the

1811
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,800
interest and the commitment and and who

1812
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,560
is well networked

1813
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,679
within the technical community

1814
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,400
um andrew thanks a lot for posting that

1815
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,639
link

1816
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,320
uh and then just the last question maybe

1817
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,000
this will spark others for more

1818
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,040
discussion but um i noticed the tension

1819
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,760
between whether or not the igf should

1820
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,960
continue to be a place for um discussion

1821
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,640
um and deliberation or whether it should

1822
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,400
have more outputs and i

1823
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,600
i feel like output driven can be a lot

1824
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,600
it can be very meaningful like it's one

1825
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,520
of the reasons why i've engaged more in

1826
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,120
intersessional work

1827
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,159
over

1828
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:40,239
years i've been in working in the igf

1829
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:42,159
rather than just focusing on the annual

1830
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:43,199
event

1831
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:45,520
um but i think even output is very

1832
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,280
different from like

1833
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,679
you know consequence or

1834
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:53,199
binding um deliberations it it's a very

1835
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:55,120
different kind of space than the ietf

1836
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,520
for example where there's clear outputs

1837
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,080
but also not just

1838
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,800
that it's an output it's actually it it

1839
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,880
then they these outputs go out in the

1840
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,159
world and they do something very

1841
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:08,239
specific i mean there's we're not making

1842
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:10,080
sure people are implementing

1843
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,520
the standards

1844
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,040
but they will be implemented and that's

1845
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,520
very important i wonder you know if

1846
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,159
there's also a parallel in the igf where

1847
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:19,920
it isn't just about producing outputs

1848
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,120
but if there is um a push for or what's

1849
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,360
the discussion i guess around making the

1850
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,360
igf um

1851
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:30,480
outcomes i guess of consequence to the

1852
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,800
internet

1853
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,159
i think that

1854
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:35,840
that i think what the the strength of

1855
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,120
the ijf is is that it brings very

1856
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,679
diverse perspectives and interests

1857
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:43,520
together

1858
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,400
and

1859
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,040
and it's in a sense a safe space where

1860
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,480
where where those those interests can

1861
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,520
play themselves out use one example the

1862
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,239
topic of regulation for example

1863
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:59,440
um a regulation of platforms let's take

1864
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:02,719
that um as an example

1865
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,400
how should that be done

1866
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,719
should it be self-regulation should it

1867
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:09,920
be by global agreement um as in further

1868
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,520
development

1869
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,679
around the international system human

1870
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:15,760
rights standards for example should it

1871
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,800
be done by national legislatures

1872
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,199
do we need new internet legislation as

1873
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:23,840
some people in civil society want

1874
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,480
and the private sector in the sense at

1875
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,080
the moment is kind of driving the

1876
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,719
process by by putting self-regulation

1877
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:32,640
into the pla into place the facebook

1878
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,800
oversight board for example

1879
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,600
um is that sufficient um

1880
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,640
so the value of the igf is that allows

1881
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,320
us to debate

1882
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:45,199
the pros and cons and of those different

1883
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:46,560
approaches

1884
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,880
so in a way it's a very um

1885
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,800
indirect

1886
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,920
way of influencing decision making

1887
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,840
sometimes yes sometimes you'll get

1888
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,520
consensus

1889
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,600
and that can then be channeled as a

1890
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,640
consensus position or insight from the

1891
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:06,239
igf into other decision making forums

1892
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:08,320
and take something like spectrum

1893
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,640
regulation for example there's been a

1894
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,880
consensus that spectrum should be

1895
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,679
regulated dynamically rather than as a

1896
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:17,600
scarce resource

1897
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,360
and the igf has been sending that

1898
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:22,560
message to the itu and to regulators for

1899
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,560
10 years still not really being

1900
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,840
implemented

1901
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,159
and but sometimes there isn't consensus

1902
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:29,760
and just the fact that there isn't

1903
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,560
consensus in itself is quite important i

1904
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,520
think

1905
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,120
so um

1906
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,199
i think mallory the the the you know the

1907
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:39,440
other value of the igf is that it is

1908
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,520
very different from from from the itf as

1909
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,280
you've said is that

1910
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,400
between 50 and 60 of participants in the

1911
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,800
annual conference every year

1912
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,760
are first-time participants

1913
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,199
and i think that's a bit of a challenge

1914
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:55,679
for the igf it's a strength because it's

1915
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,679
clear it's a kind of a clearinghouse

1916
01:19:57,679 --> 01:19:59,280
it's a space where people that are

1917
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:02,400
interested can come and network

1918
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:05,040
refine their area of interest work out

1919
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:08,080
where they should be more involved

1920
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,400
but that also means it's not an expert

1921
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,719
space it's not a space like the ietf

1922
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:14,480
where your credentials

1923
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:17,280
and you know it will shape what you are

1924
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,040
allowed to do

1925
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:21,679
and it makes it very broad based and

1926
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:22,880
quite rich

1927
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,760
but maybe not the ideal space to

1928
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,000
negotiate you know concrete policy

1929
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,400
recommendations but i think the igf can

1930
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,239
more effectively

1931
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:33,360
channel

1932
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,960
this diverse

1933
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,239
debate

1934
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:38,480
the different perspectives even the ones

1935
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,239
you know the areas where there's real

1936
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:41,679
contestation

1937
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:43,760
just by documenting that

1938
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,080
and communicating that more effectively

1939
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,719
to other decision making forums i think

1940
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:53,280
it can enrich the policy making process

1941
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,480
um

1942
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,719
yeah if there are no questions telling

1943
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:05,920
the queue last call

1944
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:09,199
please just jump in um

1945
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:11,840
if not we'll thank you andrea for coming

1946
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,840
oh colin's here good go ahead colin

1947
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,040
yeah

1948
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,360
no question but uh just just to echo the

1949
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,040
the thanks i i think it's really

1950
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,880
important to uh

1951
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,320
have this talk i think it's all

1952
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,000
important to

1953
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,960
for the the itf the irtf and the igf to

1954
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,280
understand each other uh perhaps a bit

1955
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:34,800
more and to to try and increase the

1956
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,800
in the different groups

1957
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,760
uh and i i'm not sure how we do that and

1958
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:42,080
maybe we need a bit more of an education

1959
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,320
in both directions so the the iatf

1960
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,320
participants know how how to get

1961
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,880
involved in practical terms uh as as

1962
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,719
well as of them

1963
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:52,159
you know being involved once they're

1964
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:54,880
there so i agree it's it's important

1965
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,320
that we start the conversation

1966
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,360
thanks colin and and i i really think

1967
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:04,080
the work you are doing with the protocol

1968
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,719
and i think that's valuable work i think

1969
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,639
that's a methodology

1970
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:10,960
it's a methodology that's being tried

1971
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,520
that can be applied

1972
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,400
um

1973
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,120
in other spaces other policy making

1974
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:20,560
spaces other implementing spaces

1975
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,440
um

1976
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:24,239
and as i said you know i really like the

1977
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:26,000
people that are working on environmental

1978
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,679
impact assessments

1979
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:30,080
um to also look at how you have done

1980
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,560
that to see if there might be uh lessons

1981
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,199
um to be learned and then maybe you know

1982
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:37,520
one final you know value that the igf

1983
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,880
can bring

1984
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,360
is i mean i think you don't work with

1985
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,440
governments you're very lucky probably

1986
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:44,880
that you don't have to work with

1987
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,199
governments as part of your day-to-day

1988
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:49,440
uh debate but i think particularly when

1989
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,800
it comes to

1990
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:54,239
something such as consolidating respect

1991
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:56,639
for for for human rights in the the

1992
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,719
future development of the internet

1993
01:22:58,719 --> 01:22:59,520
um

1994
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,080
uh i think liaison with governments can

1995
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,800
actually be useful and i think that can

1996
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,600
be something else the igf can provide

1997
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,440
because it has a very different makeup

1998
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,000
it's more formally constituted as

1999
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,080
government civil society business

2000
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,080
technical community and there is

2001
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,760
actually quite quite extensive

2002
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,880
participation from governments and and

2003
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,360
at times i think particularly with human

2004
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:24,320
rights

2005
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:27,040
you do want to engage governments uh

2006
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,800
because as mallory said right you know

2007
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,360
as before before i even spoke there is

2008
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,800
this existing framework of

2009
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,560
accountability with governments as

2010
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,080
duty-bearers

2011
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:38,159
so that might be something else i think

2012
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:40,400
that that could be of value

2013
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,760
to you but

2014
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,560
thanks very much for inviting me and

2015
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:49,159
i hope to see you at the igf

2016
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,639
thanks very much henriette um yeah i

2017
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:54,320
hope we hope to see

2018
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,480
more folks from the ietf there

2019
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:59,520
um or the folks that that can go between

2020
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,920
the two worlds more links are needed for

2021
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,880
sure

2022
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:03,679
um

2023
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:05,600
all right so we just have one final

2024
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:08,400
presentation um and we'll probably be

2025
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,920
ending a little bit early depending on

2026
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,080
how discussion goes um so thanks

2027
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:15,360
everyone um who's who's still

2028
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,760
sticking around for that um

2029
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:18,639
i

2030
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:21,199
can just very quickly put up the agenda

2031
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:23,840
again just to um

2032
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,600
remind us all where we've where we're

2033
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,600
supposed to be going here um so yeah

2034
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,600
we're on item number four

2035
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,000
this is an update on a draft um that

2036
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,920
actually juliana and i are both uh

2037
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,800
co-authors on and juliana is here

2038
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,440
so juliana at any point if you'd like to

2039
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:44,320
um go off mike um interrupt me or um add

2040
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,560
in your thoughts i would very seriously

2041
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,719
welcome them i'm just going to switch

2042
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:52,080
slides now slide decks rather to this so

2043
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,760
so this will look familiar to some of

2044
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,199
you um

2045
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:57,040
but we haven't discussed this draft for

2046
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:00,239
a while and the reason why i wanted to

2047
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:02,159
discuss it again is because yeah there's

2048
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:04,719
actually speaking of the igf there's an

2049
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:07,199
opportunity to talk about this work at

2050
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:10,000
the internet governance forum as part of

2051
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:10,960
an art

2052
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,280
installation actually um

2053
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:16,080
sort of an archival process of

2054
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:19,440
um looking at different ways um in which

2055
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:23,760
um you know feminism and um this draft

2056
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,239
in particular has carried on some of its

2057
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:28,239
previous work and it is actually if

2058
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:30,480
you've not um engaged with this draft

2059
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,840
for a while

2060
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,920
um it is actually very much about the

2061
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,600
process and the journey and not so much

2062
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,040
about the document itself but we're

2063
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,199
hoping to change that by um sort of

2064
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:42,638
refreshing efforts on it

2065
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,600
the abstract so the goal of this

2066
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,920
document is really to just try to

2067
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:49,840
describe how internet standards and

2068
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,679
protocols of course and their

2069
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:53,280
implementations

2070
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,560
would impact

2071
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,239
diverse groups and communities from an

2072
01:25:56,239 --> 01:25:58,159
intersectional feminist perspective so

2073
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:00,000
feminism

2074
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,320
is one school of thought intersectional

2075
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,320
feminism is a slightly different one

2076
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,840
which in which

2077
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,159
lots of different issues related to

2078
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:11,679
identity um and oppression are

2079
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:14,080
considered it isn't just about

2080
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,960
gender or sexuality or things like that

2081
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:17,760
um

2082
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:21,440
so we sort of took the idea um from rfc

2083
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,239
8280 that if you took the universal

2084
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,400
declaration of human rights which is

2085
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,400
itself sort of set of standards very

2086
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,159
clearly laid out

2087
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:33,280
and then started applying them to

2088
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:36,159
you know standards body development what

2089
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:37,440
might be

2090
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:38,960
some of the takeaways from that so it's

2091
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,560
similar to that

2092
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,719
but instead we'd have to use a sort of

2093
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:44,080
slightly different

2094
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,600
framework

2095
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,679
for the intersectional feminism side

2096
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:50,560
so

2097
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,440
um

2098
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,280
we've attempted to do that um through

2099
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,440
the history of this so uh one of the

2100
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:56,480
first

2101
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,600
um

2102
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,520
steps in this journey for this working

2103
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,880
group or this research group in

2104
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:04,239
particular was um at iitf 104 we had

2105
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:06,159
asked the association for progressive

2106
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:09,040
communications another tie to today's um

2107
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,360
session this is where andrea and i

2108
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,560
um used to work and also on avery um the

2109
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,320
feminist principles of the internet

2110
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,320
seemed like a very good place to start

2111
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,480
the discussion because like the

2112
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,719
declaration of human rights it was very

2113
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:25,199
clear and it had specific principles

2114
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:28,320
laid out um and that itself is a whole

2115
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,800
journey over many years

2116
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,639
to develop those principles so that was

2117
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:35,280
presented there was a bit of discussion

2118
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:38,159
um and then juliana and and i put pen to

2119
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:39,840
paper and actually

2120
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,320
came up with a with a version so yeah

2121
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,000
the presentation i actually ended up

2122
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,360
delivering this presentation because

2123
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,679
there was a conflict um with the

2124
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:48,800
presenter

2125
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,600
um from apc at the time but you know i

2126
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,679
took the slide deck and and i i did my

2127
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:55,600
best having at some point been involved

2128
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:58,000
in the work um but yeah the feminist

2129
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,280
principles the internet if you're not

2130
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,880
familiar you could go to feminist

2131
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:04,719
internet.net or org actually both work

2132
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:07,120
um and you can see sort of how you know

2133
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:10,000
there's they're grouped in terms of um

2134
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:10,960
different

2135
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,520
big picture ideas like access to the

2136
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,520
internet there's issue of access but

2137
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:17,280
there's also that issue of access to

2138
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,639
information

2139
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:20,719
reclaiming technology

2140
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:23,679
and you'll see echoes not just from

2141
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:25,920
human rights such as you know right to

2142
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,440
information

2143
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,880
but you also see

2144
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,840
um holy feminist concepts that have been

2145
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,679
integrated from a variety of different

2146
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:35,040
perspectives

2147
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,520
and how those um how feminism is really

2148
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,800
expressed

2149
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,080
around the world so presented that um

2150
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:45,199
then the the sort of um initial version

2151
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:47,440
kind of had two it was trying to do two

2152
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,520
things at once um maybe not once was

2153
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:51,120
trying to do two things in the same

2154
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:54,400
draft the first was how to identify um

2155
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,560
maybe at the user level

2156
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:57,440
um

2157
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,840
issues that might come up with respect

2158
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,120
to internet protocols and how they're

2159
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,800
designed and then the second thing it

2160
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:06,159
did is it tried to look inward at how

2161
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:07,360
gender

2162
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,600
is a function of

2163
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,760
the internet governance and the protocol

2164
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,440
development that happens in the ietf

2165
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,880
and so you can see that reflected here

2166
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:19,360
this was juliana's presentation from the

2167
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:22,800
ietf 105 meeting

2168
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,560
where you know at the user level we're

2169
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,760
trying to describe some of these

2170
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,440
internet threats and how it might

2171
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:30,480
actually you know be improved um by

2172
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,400
changing the way some internet protocols

2173
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,280
work and then on the other hand also

2174
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:39,360
maybe using some of this data analysis

2175
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,600
techniques right looking at actually the

2176
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,560
ietf archive to analyze terminology

2177
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:47,520
context discussion and how

2178
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,920
gender roles played into the ways in

2179
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,480
which decision making was done

2180
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,360
um

2181
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,360
that was the first version

2182
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,719
and then um

2183
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:59,040
you know we also then uh like i said

2184
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:02,239
previously the the focus has been

2185
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:05,120
then on how we actually go about

2186
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,719
doing this so again another slide from

2187
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:08,400
julio's presentation

2188
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:09,600
um

2189
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,040
you know trying to follow in the

2190
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,520
footsteps um

2191
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:14,560
of

2192
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:17,040
the 8280 process you know

2193
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,280
going point by point through each of

2194
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,440
these uh

2195
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:25,199
principles i think there were 13 or 17.

2196
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:27,120
um

2197
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,719
what you know what could you say about

2198
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:30,480
each one what could you point by point

2199
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,080
say about internet protocols in each of

2200
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:33,600
those

2201
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,719
principles

2202
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:38,000
um and then also um the other process

2203
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,719
point was just around um

2204
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:42,320
how do we actually get feedback on this

2205
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:45,199
so we didn't feel so the big focus then

2206
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:46,800
i think on the on the following version

2207
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,080
was

2208
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:51,440
how do we get feedback from actual

2209
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,679
feminist communities about what we're

2210
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:55,360
writing and saying

2211
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,120
because that's actually

2212
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,639
the um

2213
01:30:58,639 --> 01:30:59,520
i think

2214
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,400
an important element to consider is

2215
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,080
uh and maybe we can over considered it

2216
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,480
we we focused a lot on process on you

2217
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,120
know sending this draft to mailing lists

2218
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:09,920
where

2219
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:12,320
um feminists and

2220
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:15,440
technology are combined we did a few

2221
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:17,440
workshops actually at various

2222
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:18,719
conferences

2223
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:19,679
um

2224
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:21,760
julianna and i both just to just to talk

2225
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,400
about it so that feminists out there

2226
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,000
scholars out there knew that we were

2227
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,600
writing it and we wanted um their

2228
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:28,960
feedback so we've actually had a lot of

2229
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,400
opportunity for feedback

2230
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,280
um

2231
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:32,960
and we focused a lot on process but but

2232
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,719
then i think that the text isn't

2233
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:37,679
finished and it's not quite um it's not

2234
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:40,560
full yet there's no full full draft so i

2235
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,120
wanted to then so this is the history so

2236
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:47,120
far we we haven't yet got um an o2 in

2237
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,560
the data tracker yet it's sitting in

2238
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,320
github because the doc freeze we'll get

2239
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:54,000
one up uh soon um we branched out

2240
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,280
actually the

2241
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:58,159
github and issue tracker from the irtf

2242
01:31:58,159 --> 01:32:00,639
hrpc group and it's now sort of on its

2243
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:02,320
own for a little while we'll maybe merge

2244
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:05,040
it back in as a separate or give control

2245
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:06,159
to the

2246
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:08,159
uh to the repo

2247
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:10,000
to that group depending on how this

2248
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,400
discussion in particular goes um

2249
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,639
but we wanted to um update you on some

2250
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:17,040
of the just small bits that have changed

2251
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,679
since so we've got a bit of a reframe in

2252
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:22,719
the introduction thanks to juliana um

2253
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:25,199
we've had another contributor sophia

2254
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:28,400
selly come in with some suggested tweaks

2255
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,199
um and then the suggested changes which

2256
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:32,480
have yet to

2257
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,880
be done but wanted everyone's feedback

2258
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,159
on it

2259
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:37,520
based on other feedback that we've

2260
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,280
gotten is actually

2261
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:42,880
maybe we should not focus so much on the

2262
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,880
feminist principles of the internet but

2263
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,120
actually do a broader literature review

2264
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:50,239
so this would include other um

2265
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:52,400
sort of derivative works of the fpis it

2266
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:55,040
would include entirely different bodies

2267
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,280
of work on

2268
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,040
feminism and technology

2269
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,520
that are completely outside the fbi's

2270
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,639
um

2271
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:06,400
and then um the second proposed thing

2272
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,639
would be then to

2273
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:11,120
um maybe shift

2274
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,960
the um

2275
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,040
idea so so going back to

2276
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,360
to where we're talking about version

2277
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:18,800
zero zero right

2278
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:20,639
rather than do both things at the same

2279
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:23,360
time in fact use the document almost

2280
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,760
like draft guidelines so skipping the

2281
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:28,800
idea of doing a sort of 8280 similar

2282
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,280
similar um format and actually skipping

2283
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:34,719
into a guidelines like format so that

2284
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:38,560
the audience is the ietf

2285
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:40,800
sort of letting go of that you know

2286
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,880
internal conversation

2287
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,480
as much as possible and then just really

2288
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,800
focusing as much as we can in the

2289
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,440
substance of the draft on identifying

2290
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,360
those user level impacts

2291
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,760
i don't know if that shift made sense um

2292
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:56,480
it's a bit subtle and um we're coming

2293
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,560
towards the the end of this presentation

2294
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,080
so i hope you're still following but but

2295
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,080
that's i think where we want to go

2296
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:02,960
um

2297
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,800
in the in a new direction with this so

2298
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,639
that might mean that we actually then

2299
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:09,440
take the structure down

2300
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:10,239
um

2301
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:12,560
currently which breaks down each sort of

2302
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:14,080
feminist principle

2303
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,239
one by one actually erase that sort of

2304
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:18,480
do a really nice sort of literature

2305
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:20,719
review first

2306
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:22,400
and then develop from there

2307
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,600
um

2308
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,400
so i'll i'll just show one example here

2309
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,000
of something that i think is really

2310
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,960
compelling maybe for the for the future

2311
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:33,840
of the work which is things like this um

2312
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,760
you could go to this is repository

2313
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:38,159
anarchyserver.org

2314
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:39,040
where

2315
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:42,080
these collections have really tried to

2316
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:44,719
almost be an archive of sort of the

2317
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:47,920
history of feminism and technology

2318
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,080
um and that is typically what we find

2319
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:51,360
when um

2320
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:52,239
these

2321
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:54,639
sorts of bodies of work appear it is

2322
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:56,320
it's very rare you know we're not we're

2323
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:57,760
not looking to just create a wall of

2324
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:59,360
text we're actually trying to contribute

2325
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,159
to sort of a living breathing movement

2326
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:05,119
um of of activists around the world

2327
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:07,280
trying to solve these problems and this

2328
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:10,719
process in the irtf in hrpc today is

2329
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:12,480
actually part of that and that we want

2330
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:13,840
more people

2331
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:16,320
to be able to engage with these ideas

2332
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,840
um

2333
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,600
so yeah these are the proposed next

2334
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,199
steps i think for the research and

2335
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:22,880
juliana this is where i really want your

2336
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,119
thoughts and we'll definitely

2337
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:28,320
create some time after this meeting to

2338
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,159
to talk just the two of us about this

2339
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:33,119
but i'm thinking that you know we we

2340
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:34,800
might reformat the entire draft to

2341
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,040
reflect a different you know different

2342
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,040
structure so rather than going principle

2343
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:41,840
by principle we actually

2344
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:44,159
now develop a research question a

2345
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:45,840
clearer one which is how can

2346
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,000
intersectional feminism guide the

2347
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,679
development of internet standards

2348
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:52,080
protocols and their implementations

2349
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,679
we can change that but that would be

2350
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:55,520
part of the first sort of

2351
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,280
re reframe

2352
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,199
and then based on that being our our

2353
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:02,080
north star or our research question

2354
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,159
actually then just do a literature

2355
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:06,960
review um in service that question so we

2356
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,960
can really focus on storytelling so some

2357
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,880
of our sources are not going to be texts

2358
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,520
but they might be media interviews

2359
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,400
collections of such um and then to that

2360
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,800
end we'll maybe need to create somewhere

2361
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,800
somehow a repository of those things

2362
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,239
given that they're not just going to be

2363
01:36:22,239 --> 01:36:24,960
citable texts they might be a little bit

2364
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,400
less tangible

2365
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,119
um than that and then i think to

2366
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:30,320
continue

2367
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,320
in that vein we might actually think

2368
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:35,679
about either invited talks to this group

2369
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:37,840
workshops in other

2370
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:40,480
conference settings we could even do an

2371
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,480
interim meeting or two

2372
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,560
as part of hrpc

2373
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,400
um and that sort of thing so and then

2374
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,320
actually just maybe let it sit for a

2375
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:49,920
while because i don't know actually what

2376
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,840
the next step

2377
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:55,040
would be without i think a lot more

2378
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,440
convening and introspection about the

2379
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,119
things that we would find

2380
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:01,760
in the proposed steps

2381
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,520
two or three

2382
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,199
so now comes the time where i get to ask

2383
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:07,119
you you know what you think of this

2384
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:09,920
proposal um any thoughts any additions

2385
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:12,480
you have about what i'm proposing um if

2386
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,320
you are just simply interested in

2387
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,679
following the work or at some point

2388
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:18,400
getting involved please email us email

2389
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,440
the

2390
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:22,400
um juliana and i as authors or anyone

2391
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:25,280
else who joins us support for this

2392
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:27,920
document with the email here

2393
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:30,239
and then also i'd love for folks to

2394
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:32,639
either put in the chat or put yourself

2395
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:34,159
in the queue as to whether or not you

2396
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:37,520
think um the hrpc should adopt this

2397
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,480
draft um as it has

2398
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:41,440
i think

2399
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,760
right now um not a whole lot of work

2400
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,040
items

2401
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:46,960
um and so i'd like to get

2402
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,880
i'd like to get this group a little bit

2403
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,639
more focused on

2404
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:52,000
on something of interest i think this

2405
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,679
should be it but that's just a proposal

2406
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:56,239
so please let me know what you think

2407
01:37:56,239 --> 01:38:00,119
i'm watching the queue now

2408
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:18,159
go ahead niels

2409
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:19,600
um

2410
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:23,520
i have like draft politics which i think

2411
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,679
which which i given quite a lot of

2412
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:27,520
thought and there's quite some work

2413
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:31,119
there but i'm hesitant to restart work

2414
01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:33,040
on that before draft guidelines and

2415
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,119
draft association

2416
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:37,440
go out of the door so

2417
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:40,159
so so that is a bit my thinking so first

2418
01:38:40,159 --> 01:38:42,480
get that those ones done

2419
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:46,239
before the other stuff comes through

2420
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:51,519
and i think

2421
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,480
sorry there's the echo i think it wasn't

2422
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,320
a

2423
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:57,920
working group document or a research

2424
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,840
group document is that right don't go

2425
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,679
away just yet

2426
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:03,440
oh

2427
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:05,320
my

2428
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:06,880
[Music]

2429
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:10,480
not sure actually i think it

2430
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:14,080
was because i worked on it extensively

2431
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:16,960
with andrew sullivan who then had to

2432
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:19,199
yeah it was adopted as a research group

2433
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:20,159
document

2434
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:22,320
yeah for sure

2435
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,080
yeah actually quite uh for seven

2436
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:25,600
versions already

2437
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:26,639
yeah

2438
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:28,560
yeah i recall and i feel like the last

2439
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,800
time you talked about draft politics we

2440
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,320
wanted to take it an entirely different

2441
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,440
direction

2442
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:35,199
which could be which could be fine we

2443
01:39:35,199 --> 01:39:36,639
have a habit of doing that in this

2444
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:40,960
research group we start here and then

2445
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:43,040
hard left and go

2446
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:45,199
so that's fine um i mean that's kind of

2447
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:46,800
what i'm proposing with draft feminism

2448
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,239
as well so

2449
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:49,840
um i don't think that they necessarily

2450
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,920
have to be um exclusive like we could

2451
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:54,320
still you know adopt the draft feminism

2452
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:58,639
work um with um the aim of getting

2453
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:00,880
also draft politics back on the docket

2454
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:03,520
it's it's oh totally i think that the

2455
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:06,080
approaches would be very different also

2456
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,960
yeah for sure for sure for sure

2457
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,159
i mean in a way they could be

2458
01:40:10,159 --> 01:40:12,400
complimentary because i feel like

2459
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:13,520
with

2460
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:17,760
draft politics you know you're aiming to

2461
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:20,000
basically make a definitive statement

2462
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,639
that you know technology's not neutral

2463
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:25,600
uh you know with a lot of

2464
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,280
citations and and deeper thought than

2465
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,040
that but and i think that you know

2466
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,880
obviously feminism or intersectional

2467
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,800
feminism is an expression of politics

2468
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:35,280
it's a very specific one um and so i

2469
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,960
think rather than making a general

2470
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:38,960
statement it actually kind of accepts

2471
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,800
the premise that

2472
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:41,760
um

2473
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,760
technology is not neutral and it is

2474
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:46,800
political and quality and then and how

2475
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,040
right and how in particular

2476
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,440
so i do see them as complimentary i

2477
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:52,719
almost see them they don't necessarily

2478
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:54,480
have to be linear but i think one sort

2479
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:58,080
of assumes the premise of the other

2480
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,080
other thoughts on just whether or not

2481
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:01,679
because i don't think it makes sense to

2482
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:04,960
adopt the draft if there's not um sort

2483
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:06,560
of interest from the rest of the group

2484
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,239
about that um

2485
01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:10,159
and if there isn't then certainly

2486
01:41:10,159 --> 01:41:12,400
juliana and i can think

2487
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,760
about

2488
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:17,040
how we can change or or or

2489
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:18,719
how we can make progress on this draft

2490
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:21,600
between now and 113 to convince you

2491
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,000
otherwise

2492
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:30,159
uh hi mallory uh i'm not sure that

2493
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:32,560
adoption is necessarily the important

2494
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:34,800
point take so obviously people you know

2495
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,239
if there's interest in the group then

2496
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:37,440
people

2497
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:39,199
interested in the work then then people

2498
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:40,560
can work on

2499
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,960
on a document whether it's been adopted

2500
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:45,520
by by the group or not um

2501
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:47,280
and i think that the main thing i would

2502
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,600
i would encourage you and the rest of

2503
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:51,199
the members of the group to do is if

2504
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:52,560
there are topics which are interesting

2505
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:55,119
then to work on the work on the document

2506
01:41:55,119 --> 01:41:58,400
work work on getting this described and

2507
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,719
building community uh and we we can

2508
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:02,080
figure out whether the right thing to do

2509
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:03,520
is for the group to adopt them or

2510
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,040
publish them in some other way at a

2511
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,320
later point so

2512
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,159
doing interesting work is more important

2513
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:09,119
than

2514
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:11,520
you know the precise process details of

2515
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,920
exactly what's adopted when web

2516
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:15,920
and this looks like interesting it looks

2517
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:18,000
highly relevant so

2518
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,840
that's what i want to i want people to

2519
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,760
get involved and i want

2520
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:22,639
you know

2521
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:25,440
that that's my main um

2522
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:27,840
my main goal is to get to get to have

2523
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:30,159
presented this today to in the hopes of

2524
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:32,480
of getting more people to um

2525
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,360
write to us or contribute to the github

2526
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:38,159
um but just to say that you know if part

2527
01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:40,080
of our process and let me go back a

2528
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:42,800
slide is to maybe you know focus a lot

2529
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:45,600
more on the storytelling and continue to

2530
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,080
um to think about process with respect

2531
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,400
to other communities that are actually

2532
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:52,400
active on this topic and connecting it

2533
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:54,560
to them if we go to a workshop for

2534
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,639
example like it could just be juliana

2535
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:59,360
juliana and i or or some combination of

2536
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:00,719
the authors or folks that have

2537
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:03,440
contributed presenting this work

2538
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:05,920
but i think it can also be um more

2539
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,639
meaningful to folks to locate it within

2540
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:10,719
the internet research task force

2541
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:13,280
specifically hrpc not as necessarily

2542
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:16,480
like an ownership or a stamp or a

2543
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,520
sort of

2544
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:20,719
i don't know authority um signal but

2545
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:22,960
um i think it then helps to bring people

2546
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:25,040
back into hrpc right where it's like

2547
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,199
this isn't just our idea it's actually

2548
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:29,360
supported by a sort of larger group that

2549
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:31,440
thinks it's a good idea to keep

2550
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:32,639
thinking and talking about this so

2551
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:34,960
that's all at some point i i do think

2552
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,080
that that can

2553
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:38,639
really compel folks outside of this body

2554
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:40,719
to understand um the importance of this

2555
01:43:40,719 --> 01:43:41,840
work

2556
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:42,639
um

2557
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:45,520
at um the ietf

2558
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,840
yeah and i i would agree with that and

2559
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:50,000
if that's a useful thing to do then by

2560
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,239
all means you know to bring the work

2561
01:43:52,239 --> 01:43:54,480
into the into the group and adopt it it

2562
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:56,960
seems clearly in in your chatter and and

2563
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:59,119
it looks interesting for the

2564
01:43:59,119 --> 01:44:00,639
you know sort of

2565
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:02,159
you know it seems there's people

2566
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:05,519
interested in doing the work so

2567
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:12,239
all right i'm gonna leave the queue open

2568
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:15,519
for another beat or so

2569
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:21,840
if anybody anybody'd like to jump in

2570
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,520
also happy if you want to throw anything

2571
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:30,719
in the chat if you don't want to get on

2572
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:34,199
mic that's fine

2573
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,000
all right

2574
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,840
um it doesn't seem like anyone else has

2575
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:48,480
anything to say about that so i think we

2576
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:51,040
have gone through our agenda for the day

2577
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:53,040
um

2578
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,480
and so

2579
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:56,719
there's not much there's not much left

2580
