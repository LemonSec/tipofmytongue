1
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,280
on because i would say that kyle's was

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,360
flipping so it may just be local

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,919
conditions

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,720
i actually figured that you were that

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,480
you're you were dropping a little bit

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,400
from uh because of your internet

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,960
connection that was my assumption

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,519
but it's so minor that i wouldn't worry

9
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,840
about it you're perfectly audible

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,680
yeah that's let's not discuss ethernet

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,640
today

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,239
that was that was the other technical

13
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,199
challenge of the morning but

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,200
we're just going to say that apple needs

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,120
to figure out their usbc

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,200
implementation again and leave it at

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,440
that

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,440
all right

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,440

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,640

22
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,399

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,199
taking of notes

24

26
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,760

so um

52
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,680
i guess we should note the node well

53
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,800
well

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,239
um

55
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,239
remember reminding everyone not only

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,840
about the um patents

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,440
and the um

58
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,760
the requirement to declare any

59
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,319
knowledge of um

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,560
ipr and encumbered

61
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,560
technologies which you'll

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,480
i'd like to end up covering a whole lot

63
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,000
in this discussion but that is still an

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,200
iot requirement and any discussions here

65
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,640
can and will be used as part of the ietf

66
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,239
uh proceedings

67
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,280
um

68
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,160
and

69
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,200
uh

70
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,640
in particular i'd like to draw

71
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,480
everyone's attention to the

72
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,720
fact that we do have a code of conduct

73
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,319
um and the url is on the slide for

74
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,400
the code of conduct and how to contact

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,319
the ombuds team if you leave that you've

76
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,440
had

77
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,879
if you have if you feel you've had an

78
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,280
issue with improper conduct

79
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,840
uh at the ietf

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,519
i think that's a hopefully that's a

81
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,519
reasonable covering of the note well

82
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,280
kyle anything else you'd like to surface

83
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,959
in the

84
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,319
i mean i would yeah i would just say

85
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,080
that regarding the regarding the code of

86
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,640
conduct and and harassment just treat

87
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,319
your fellow participants with respect

88
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,640
and don't be an and

89
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,959
things will probably be fine

90
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,720
so

91
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,080
great

92
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,519
our next slide

93
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,400
yep

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,920
so we have a pretty straightforward

95
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,319
agenda this morning um

96
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,440
we've already managed to get through

97
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,280
all of the admin hooray

98
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,239
um

99
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,599
we do have some extra industry updates

100
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,879
from glendeen and sanjay this morning

101
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,640
a couple of updates on the working group

102
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,159
docs and then

103
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,920
some interesting other work going on

104
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,000
within the ietf

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,080
and then

106
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,480
it seems a valuable time to take a take

107
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,000
a look back over the last two years of

108
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,760
the mops working group my goodness has

109
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,599
it been two years already

110
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,400
um

111
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,200
and

112
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,720
talk a little bit more about where we

113
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,239
have been and where we might go from

114
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,599
here so um unless anyone would like to

115
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,360
bash that agenda

116
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,639
um

117
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,600

118
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,440

alliance also known as the sva

154
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,720

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,080
you know what we'll clarify questions on

158
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,400

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,840
i'll you know we can talk at the end of

160
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,880
this

161
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,960
um so the sva has been uh pumping a lot

162
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,039
of work recently uh you know it's been a

163
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,680
very productive 2021 despite you know

164
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,360
what we've all been facing

165
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,800
and uh

166
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,240
the way the sva is organized is very

167
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,039
much like the ietf we're divided up into

168
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,199
working groups that focus on particular

169
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,160
areas we have focuses on uh you know

170
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,960
security privacy augmented reality

171
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,400
uh vr

172
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,160
live streaming

173
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,880
and caching things like that and so when

174
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,720
i go through this deck a lot of this can

175
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,360
be sort of topic focused uh and then on

176
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,960
to the next topic and it's sort of

177
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,800
organized by a working group

178
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,400
so the first thing i want to highlight

179
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,440
is we have released a a test bed now for

180
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,759
the open caching api so those who are

181
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,160
familiar with open caching from sva

182
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,840
there's a linkage across pollination

183
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,039
here going on with uh the open caching

184
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,919
uh at itf there's our open caching sba

185
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,160
and the cdni working group over at itf

186
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,560
in fact sanjay uh you know is involved

187
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,720
in both uh especially at the itf as one

188
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,599
of the co-chairs uh and so

189
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,919
you know we've been developing these uh

190
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,560
these apis uh at the sva around open

191
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,800
caching for several years now and we've

192
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,360
now put together a test bed uh to allow

193
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,720
people who are trying to adopt those

194
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,120
apis to actually exercise against them

195
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,039
and uh check to see if you know where

196
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,479
they need uh compliance

197
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,199
so

198
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,840
that's a bit up and rolling uh we also

199
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,160
have some configuration apis they were

200
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,520
so awesome we had to split them into

201
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,639
three documents uh so there they are uh

202
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,240
this has actually been a considerable

203
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,080
amount of work going through that group

204
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,479
uh to create these configuration apis

205
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,199
and it's really meant to be sort of um a

206
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,759
companion uh to the rest of this work

207
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,479
we're doing around uh caching and uh

208
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,199
availability

209
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,639
next up uh we had a live streaming plc

210
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,240
and a couple of these slides are going

211
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,879
to talk about plc's that were going on

212
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,520
you know one of the things the sva does

213
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,759
uh above and beyond working on sort of

214
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,879
apis and specs and best practices

215
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,960
is uh you know we're sort of i guess you

216
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,840
could say where the industry meets the

217
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,160
specifications uh because in the room we

218
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,360
have a lot of people who do technical

219
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,680
specifications and architectures and and

220
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,280
product we also have a lot of people in

221
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
the room who are actually deployed

222
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,160
uh centric and uh content delivery

223
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,960
centric so uh in the end you know we

224
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,560
have this great opportunity to bring

225
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,680
together the people doing the

226
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,000
specifications with the people doing the

227
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,799
deployments and allowing us to sort of

228
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,240
you know let them do some proof of

229
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,000
concepts and say well does this

230
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,760
architecture we've all put together

231
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,800
across the itf across cinti across other

232
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,200
wars like scudy and

233
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,120
at the sva does all that come together

234
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,040
in a meaningful way and what can we

235
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,560
learn from that to feed back into all

236
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,920
the various organizations that are

237
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,480
contributing and so we put these pocs

238
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,160
together uh we've got a couple that will

239
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,399
come up in the decks here but typically

240
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,959
the live stream plc uh has been uh

241
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,399
active uh they've got some um

242
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,519
links here uh that uh that you can go

243
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,040
off and follow and particularly they've

244
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,720
been working on measuring live our

245
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,600
latency in abr streaming and so that's a

246
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,360
very much a great example of you know

247
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,680
putting together this the specifications

248
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,279
we're all been working on you know abr

249
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,560
has you know been around for a few years

250
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,560
but you know latency reducing that

251
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,120
especially for live streaming uh for

252
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,279
things like sports are huge right now in

253
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,680
the delivery industry and so this plc

254
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,760
brings together that uh exercise and

255
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,440
says well are we at the right

256
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,880
we're the right way are we going the

257
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,560
right direction is there things missing

258
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,480
that we need to take back into our

259
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,080
development work into our specification

260
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,120
work and expand on

261
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,120
another plc we have is

262
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,399
all about latency

263
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,080
in streaming vr

264
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,360
uh so

265
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,640
you're gonna see a theme here a lot of

266
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,320
these things it's latency latency

267
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,480
latency and a big part of that is if you

268
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,640
you know look at the the the content

269
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,000
industry there's been this shift in the

270
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,399
last few years you know when we started

271
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,320
mops even two years ago the big focus

272
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,800
was very much on delivering

273
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,600
of uh pre-word recorded content or you

274
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,320
know stuff that was from files often in

275
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,760
the industry we call the spot video on

276
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,800
demand

277
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,959
and you know that's what we've been

278
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,320
doing when we watch a movie we're

279
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,920
watching video on demand

280
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,720
and

281
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,800
we've got it pretty well done but one of

282
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,560
the things that you can be very tolerant

283
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,959
of in a vaude setting is latency you

284
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,440
don't care if you know the movie is

285
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,600
starting up one you know half a second

286
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,440
later or a second later or two seconds

287
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,079
later uh you you're very taller because

288
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,839
it's a recorded film another if you're

289
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,519
watching live sports you want to make

290
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,760
sure that the the events you're seeing

291
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,200
on the screen are as close to uh live as

292
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,519
possible and this is sort of the new big

293
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,279
challenge in front of the streaming

294
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,360
world it's how do we reduce that latency

295
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
so that experience is as close to live

296
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,440
as possible and so that applies to live

297
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,600
streamings applies to vr everything

298
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
we're doing is trying to like bridge

299
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,640
that uh that gap between you know what

300
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,079
you end up with on your screen you know

301
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,839
your goggles and what happens in the

302
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,839
real world and so you're gonna see that

303
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,839
sort of a repeating theme in this deck

304
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,519
but also as we go forward with

305
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,600
specifications and work that's a big

306
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,800
focus area in the industry

307
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,120
uh we also have a distributed request

308
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,519
tracing uh this is a another way for us

309
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,440
to tell how well the

310
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
uh the system is working end to end as

311
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
part of the qoe experience and of course

312
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,360
you know you can make things very fast

313
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,680
and very low latency but you can do it

314
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,000
by shaving off quality and that's not

315
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,440
good especially when we're talking about

316
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,200
things like live sports equality and

317
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,760
sports is something that viewers demand

318
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,800
and so

319
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,200
part of the qe experience work uh in

320
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,079
this distributed tracing framework is

321
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,320
actually start looking at how do we uh

322
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,480
collaborate end-to-end and collect all

323
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,480
that data so we can understand when it's

324
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,399
working when it isn't working and why it

325
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,680
isn't working

326
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,639
and so if you're interested in that

327
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,560
space and i think just real overlap with

328
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,279
some of the itf uh stuff please go check

329
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,399
out this link

330
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,839
and you can see what that project is

331
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,160
doing

332
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,240
and then something that's probably

333
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,399
pretty relevant to the itf

334
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,639
uh quick for video streaming uh you know

335
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,480
now that we have quick publishers with

336
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,600
specification yay um you know there's

337
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
been a lot of conversation at the itf

338
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,920
around quick for streaming you know we

339
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,240
have mock which is you know meeting and

340
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,040
discussing uh you know the aspects there

341
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,800
well the sva as well has been taking a

342
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,519
look at quick and you know uh looking

343
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,279
back at some of the notes when we did an

344
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,560
update from the svh the itf uh a couple

345
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,399
its ago one of the comments we made was

346
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,240
you know we're looking at quick but we

347
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,160
didn't have any clear plans to pick up

348
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,399
and start deploying it at scale as a

349
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,560
delivery infrastructure you know as an

350
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,600
industry

351
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,639
and

352
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,480
one of the things we identified in

353
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
asking the question why is that was that

354
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,600
you know there's a little big shift

355
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,760
going on here right obviously shifting

356
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,480
to quick udp infrastructure away from

357
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,959
the tcp based infrastructure that the

358
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,959
delivery guys all know and have

359
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,399
instrumented really well

360
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,920
is a big challenge

361
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,360
and it's retraining it's uh developing

362
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,120
some new tools and new ways of looking

363
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,040
at the problem space and it's also

364
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,480
understanding how this all comes

365
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,639
together with expectations of the all

366
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,639
the expectations of the new and what

367
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,240
tools and infrastructure we have to

368
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,360
support it

369
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,160
and so one of these the uh the sva has

370
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,600
decided to do

371
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,000
is to create a poc

372
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,320
that is going to

373
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,639
build both a reference architecture for

374
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,200
testing the environment but try to uh

375
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,600
tease out the details of how do you do

376
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,199
that instrumentation and how do you do

377
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,480
the metrics collection from end to end

378
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,040
so that you can actually evaluate quick

379
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,560
compared to your current delivery

380
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,720
environments evaluate quick you know

381
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,600
what it

382
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,519
looks like compared to that but also how

383
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,959
you can then start exercising some of

384
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,399
the more advanced features of quick that

385
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,480
aren't available in the old world and so

386
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,079
ultimately the goal here is to build a

387
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,199
reference

388
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,839
uh evaluation platform

389
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,800
that the uh the broader industry can

390
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,120
take and make use of uh so they don't

391
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,639
themselves have to sort through things

392
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,880
so in practical terms what have we done

393
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,399
so one of our first things we've been

394
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,800
working on is looking through all the

395
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,040
the myriad of quick server

396
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,600
implementations that are out there and

397
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,800
trying to you know

398
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,199
create a set of criteria well why would

399
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,440
you pick one over the other and what

400
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,000
features are you looking for in a quick

401
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,399
server implementation and how would you

402
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,079
then do instrumentation that connects in

403
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,320
with the tool sets you already have

404
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,480
as part of your delivery environment

405
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,600
likewise we're looking at the player's

406
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,279
side how you connect with a player that

407
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,279
supports quick and how you instrument

408
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,279
properly and then how do all the pieces

409
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,800
in the middle come together in a

410
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,120
coherent way and the idea behind this

411
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,519
plc is it will start publishing at each

412
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,639
of its five phases outputs uh that the

413
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,320
sva members and the broader industry can

414
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
take a look at and make use of in their

415
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,480
own evaluation quick so hopefully this

416
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,360
helps bridge that gap between you know i

417
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,279
want to play with it and i now have

418
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,880
touched it played with i now understand

419
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,320
it i can start figuring how it fits in

420
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,680
american picture

421
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,000
and also one of the big goals here is to

422
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,240
be able to bring back to the itf

423
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,560
real life experiences around this to say

424
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,680
well here's what worked here is what

425
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,519
didn't work here's some things we think

426
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,199
we made directions we may want to

427
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,580
suggest going in to improve things

428
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,600
[Music]

429
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,000
and it's bringing together here uh so if

430
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,759
you need to get a hold of any of us uh

431
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,000
i'm glenn dean i'm nbc universal and

432
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,240
comcast here's my email uh we have

433
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,680
sanjay uh

434
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,519
at verizon and we have jt at the

435
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,199
streamingvideolines.org uh and with that

436
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,839
are there any questions

437
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,399
all right uh uh kyle are you guys

438
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,519
bingeing the key or do you want me to

439
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,279
manage the queue

440
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,279
oh we're uh we're managing the queue oh

441
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,000
oh

442
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,160
yes so go ahead jake

443
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,199
all right uh okay good

444
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,160
uh

445
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,240
yeah thanks glenn um i wanted to ask

446
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,639
about uh

447
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,160
so it

448
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,240
some of the documents in the sva look

449
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,519
like they're

450
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,440
available for free download i'm not sure

451
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,079
about the distribution policies like

452
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,079
obviously the ipr

453
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,160
and copyright kind of constraints are

454
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,399
quite different than in the itf and

455
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,120
i was curious

456
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,880
just sort of how much of this work do

457
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,480
you anticipate bringing to the itf and

458
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,480
kind of getting it into the more

459
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,000
you know clear

460
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,040
uh space and how much of it is uh like

461
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,120
do we do we have to ask our lawyers

462
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,480
before we should get involved and

463
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,199
whatnot you know well you know the

464
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,120
official answer as we both know is

465
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,399
always you must ask the lawyers for

466
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,399
everything

467
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,519
because

468
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,639
you know engineers aren't allowed to

469
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,759
make decisions like that um but

470
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,800
you know

471
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,600
so

472
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,119
the work of the sva really can be

473
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,280
divided into a couple categories right

474
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,119
one of them is sort of technical

475
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,720
specifications

476
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,599
those may contain uh ip related stuff

477
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,439
and if you're an sva member part of

478
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,039
joining the organization is of course

479
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,520
agree the ip licensing rules which

480
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,160
really focus on uh providing licenses to

481
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,959
other

482
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,119
uh sva members if they want to negotiate

483
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,280
with you yeah and it's not the sv unlike

484
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,400
the itf

485
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,640
isn't uh essentially you know like

486
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,679
as open a ip policy it's very flexible

487
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,600
if you're a member if you're an outsider

488
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,240
it's it's different right

489
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,400
but that's for the specifications and

490
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,480
the really technical stuff or the things

491
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,559
like plc's

492
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,960
uh best practices

493
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,600
and white papers those are things which

494
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,400
do not typically contain any ip related

495
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,640
assertions or materials because they're

496
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,000
they're looking at the industry level

497
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,200
and they're looking at the technology

498
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
level that's available across the open

499
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,039
industry like so quick would be a good

500
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,120
example right we're not building a quick

501
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,360
server at the eye at the sva we're not

502
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,160
putting sda member you know ip into that

503
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,240
quick server we're taking stuff that's

504
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,080
already out there that's available off

505
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,360
the shelf

506
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,760
typically open source and and taking it

507
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,520
in and making use of it and documenting

508
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,600
how we make use of it so that stuff is

509
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,440
all available and will be available when

510
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,600
published to the outside world you can

511
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,360
just go to the sva website

512
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,280
uh click on the download you know it

513
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,640
does the same thing where it asks you to

514
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,480
i think register your email address so

515
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,760
we know who you are

516
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,080
and then you download it and and

517
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,760
right the documents you know copyrighted

518
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,679
by the sva but of course you know you

519
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,919
can go out and read and use it and stuff

520
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,760
like that uh the copyright is to prevent

521
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,520
you from republishing it yourself as

522
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,320
your own work uh but not to consume it

523
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,880
uh so you that's as you know and we're

524
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,080
trying to make it as open as possible

525
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,240
because the goal here is to really help

526
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,559
bridge the world between

527
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,799
the delivery operations environment that

528
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,120
is sort of the sva and then the the

529
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,919
development architecture like the itf

530
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,280
um

531
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,640
i kind of liken it sometimes unto

532
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,039
uh like what analog does right now is

533
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,720
full of people who actually take

534
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,880
the technical specs for networks deploy

535
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,039
them and make them work and the itf

536
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,880
writes those technical specs and that

537
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,960
will feed back to the itf where things

538
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,799
work and where things don't work and ask

539
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,799
for changes and i think that's a very

540
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,799
similar relationship between the sva and

541
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,120
the itf for video

542
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,679
does that sort of cover it

543
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,919
uh that's helpful thanks

544
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,039
um

545
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,720
i i guess i'll have to

546
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,160
check with the lawyers but yeah thank

547
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,520
you well

548
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,799
and and the other thing i should add to

549
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,039
is obviously we have like sanjay and

550
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,600
myself were very active in the itf and

551
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,240
so part of our you know role here i

552
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,120
think is to act as that uh

553
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,640
that bridge where it's appropriate and

554
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,919
and to pull things out of one and bring

555
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,120
them over to the other one and there's

556
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,200
other people at the itf that's you know

557
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,120
engage with the sva on a regular basis

558
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,880
in various written groups and so i think

559
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,240
there's a you know an ongoing

560
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,559
relationship of back and forth here yeah

561
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,400
i want to i want to thank clinton yeah

562
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,039
say that there's a sort of

563
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,520
a meta purpose of

564
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,520
sharing that this work is going on

565
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,559
because it's related to ietf work

566
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,080
uh the the ins and outs of how how

567
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,919
you know people here actually engage in

568
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,919
work there and vice versa

569
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,280
are

570
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,879
a little a little trickier perhaps

571
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,039
and i'll point out that you know

572
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,960
we do the opposite to the two groups

573
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,120
like the sva we take the updates that

574
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,679
happen at the itf in places like mops

575
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,919
and a bunch of us go back to the sva in

576
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,679
their working groups and we talk there

577
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,760
about what's going on in the itf to make

578
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,360
sure that we've got cross-pollination

579
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,120
going on actively and ongoing between

580
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,520
the two organizations

581
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,720
anyways that's my presentation did

582
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,080
sanjay have anything you wanted to add

583
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,880
in

584
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,760
my co-author

585
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,400
i think um you you've covered it pretty

586
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,520
well so i don't really have anything

587
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,799
more to add unless there are any

588
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,200
questions

589
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,640
and you can follow up with either one of

590
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,880
us or both of us um afterwards uh you

591
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,039
know we're obviously here on the ietf

592
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,039
and uh we're around other places so

593
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,280
don't be shy

594
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,679
all right thank you great great thank

595
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,720
you both thank you

596
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,120
all right um so i think jake you are up

597
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,039
next with the follow up from working

598
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,360
group last call on the ops con stock

599
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,559
yeah all right i think i can't click on

600
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,320
the

601
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,120
uh

602
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,679
video while it's trying to wait oh what

603
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:56,799
happened

604
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,280
there's a modal that pops up okay i

605
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,720
guess i have to beat that up that makes

606
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,000
sense

607
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,600
sorry i think it's my first time trying

608
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,000
to use this particular tool usually i

609
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,440
shared my screen

610
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,400
all right

611
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,159
it's kind of neat though

612
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,799
uh but you you lose the opportunity to

613
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,240
uh you know have embarrassing

614
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,799
notifications show up uh to everyone in

615
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,520
the

616
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,880
in the working group

617
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,640
well i can still do that like on my

618
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,600
screen you can see my uh reflection off

619
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,000
the car out the window there

620
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,640
it's that time in the morning

621
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,799
for me out here on the west coast all

622
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,080
right

623
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,159
uh so i was just going to give an update

624
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,080
on our

625
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,840
our adopted draft

626
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,039
that uh

627
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,200
tell everybody where we all are

628
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,400
uh so

629
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,159
our last call you know

630
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,559
quote passed without uh without

631
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,480
objections uh there was one comment in

632
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,280
support of advancing it uh but this is

633
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,400
not sort of the you know overwhelming

634
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,240
support that we see in the room

635
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,840
uh for

636
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,679
uh some of the

637
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,840
some of the questions we've we've asked

638
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,039
from time to time so um

639
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,799
we wanted to just kind of confirm it and

640
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,320
make sure that

641
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,080
there really is working group consensus

642
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,240
to to move this forward

643
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,520
uh

644
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,840
and i was going to go over kind of the

645
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,039
the

646
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,720
status on our last few

647
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,840
you know

648
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,600
gasps of working on this

649
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,679
we close you know we raised and closed

650
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,840
uh over 40 issues you can see them in

651
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,760
the github link

652
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,520
there's a bunch of good stuff there

653
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,799
we

654
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,600
had to open issues remaining when we

655
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,320
finished and uh i guess i'd characterize

656
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
these as like

657
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,679
more running out of steam and and uh

658
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,799
uh having conflicts that necessarily

659
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,600
uh

660
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,679
we decided not to like we we had a

661
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,080
couple of leanings on this in different

662
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,919
directions and some questions as to like

663
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,240
really should we

664
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,000
uh put this in but um

665
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,520
know so uh

666
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,279
there there was a little

667
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,000
comment on it that like

668
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,799
maybe if there's something we can

669
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,279
that the operators can do about it then

670
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,360
we should include it but maybe

671
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,000
not otherwise and so this was the

672
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,919
this was the last thing where i think we

673
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,080
just dropped the ball on kind of getting

674
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,400
it in uh its final state was assigned to

675
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,840
me so this one's my fault um you know

676
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,400
there's there's some reasonable things

677
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,240
that an operator can do if dns is

678
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,840
is coming into play as a potential

679
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,400
performance problem and um

680
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,000
so it's not an unreasonable thing to

681
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,919
include we do not have this listed as

682
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,360
one of our blockers for going ahead with

683
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,520
black with with last call i expect there

684
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,440
are other

685
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,960
things that can affect performance that

686
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,039
we did not really cover in our in the

687
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,840
dock in the end uh so you know this is

688
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,360
uh

689
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,600
perhaps a gap but i'm not sure it's such

690
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
an important gap that we should

691
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,120
update it and do another last call

692
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,919
and the other one was kind of

693
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,760
there was an interesting talk

694
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,360
last time about the comparative latency

695
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,400
under load from uh from comcast

696
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,919
um

697
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,279
and we had a little bit of discussion i

698
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,679
think spencer had the idea that uh that

699
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,000
there were a few worthwhile sentences to

700
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,120
to

701
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,840
suggest on this topic and uh um

702
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,240
you know i was a little bit

703
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,120
uh i'm not sure it really fits but uh

704
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,200
you know lawfully and regardless the

705
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,720
sentences never quite got submitted i

706
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,360
guess i'd put this as another one that's

707
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,840
maybe nice to have but not necessary um

708
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,600
but that's really all we had

709
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,760
and i guess my big question is like

710
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,520
are we really ready to move forward can

711
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,799
we i don't know we're on a poll

712
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,960
does anybody have concerns about this

713
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
that didn't make it to the list

714
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,000
uh

715
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,720
etc so that that is all i have i guess

716
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,120
really what i wanted is a

717
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,400
discussion

718
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,360
maybe a

719
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,720
confirmation

720
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,960
something like this section on mock yes

721
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,080
thanks ali

722
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,000
uh that'll have to be its own working

723
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,279
group i'm afraid

724
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,720
in my opinion

725
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,559
but please feel free to disagree

726
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,679
flourish floors open i'm inviting cues

727
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,679
eric

728
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,600
yeah no specific

729
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,919
no specific comment on on the draft per

730
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,720
se but more on the group last call

731
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,320
there was only one

732
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,120
review by glenn on the mailing list

733
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,520
that's a little bit short

734
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
right so i don't want to be the document

735
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,200
shepherd to say and declare group

736
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,600
consensus when there was only one review

737
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,440
so i really urge

738
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,760
other participants in this working group

739
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,480
that are here or not listening basically

740
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,720
to review the document and saying like

741
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,120
glenn it's okay i support like it is

742
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,799
that's enough right so you don't need to

743
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,840
put a ten thousand issue uh the sort of

744
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,760
the better some specifically for you

745
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,360
jake right

746
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,480
yeah yeah so

747
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,679
i'm slightly concerned if only one

748
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,440
review done by glenn

749
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,600
uh it may cause problem when you go

750
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,440
later in the process

751
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,480
right actually

752
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,320
yeah

753
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,159
i have to review it so part of the

754
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,360
purpose

755
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,120
part of the reasoning putting this on

756
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,760
the agenda for today was was to flesh

757
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,840
out if if there were

758
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,399
issues that were going to come up in itf

759
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,320
wide last call let's let's hear what

760
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,000
they are now rather than

761
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,679
being surprised but i certainly take the

762
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,799
point that a document shepard's gonna

763
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,279
be unimpressed by a single

764
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,080
um

765
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,240
so i see two people in the queue i think

766
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,320
that probably where we want to close out

767
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,159
today's um

768
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,320
activity is to

769
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,799
take names uh who's willing who's

770
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,600
willing to review um or and or just send

771
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,919
a note to the list saying that you know

772
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,080
you read it and support it's going

773
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,720
forward but

774
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,679
i guess sanjay is next

775
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,840
yes i'm i'm next and um i just wanted to

776
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,399
i think eric's point well

777
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,720
and i definitely owe a review and i will

778
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,679
be reviewing the document

779
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,039
so i'm on the record

780
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,760
great thank you sanjay

781
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,880
um so uh i can't uh volunteered review

782
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,240
pieces since apparently i already did a

783
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,120
review

784
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,320
uh but uh i will take this over to the

785
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,159
working groups over the sva and make

786
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,600
them aware of the document as well so

787
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,799
they get some eyeballs from that

788
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,080
organization on it and i'll spread it

789
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,399
around some social contacts i have in

790
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,440
the industry because i think this is

791
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,000
some important stuff um

792
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,600
to eric i want to point out that you

793
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,880
know

794
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,840
because we're now using

795
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,880
github uh for the the editor process uh

796
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,159
for this i will point out that

797
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,279
tremendous amount of conversation

798
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,520
actually took place on that github and

799
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,600
i'm wondering if somehow we it would be

800
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,240
appropriate to make a shepherd aware of

801
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,399
the github conversations that went into

802
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,120
the process because

803
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,240
historically it would have been on the

804
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,399
list but now it's sort of on this other

805
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,480
place so i don't know how to solve that

806
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,240
but suggestions would be welcome

807
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,520
there is indeed a dichotomy somehow

808
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,760
between the github and the mailing list

809
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,520
but until now it's still a mailing list

810
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,880
that counts

811
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,240
and

812
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,320
if you open for instance couple of

813
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,039
issues in the github no things block you

814
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,039
to send in the working group last call

815
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,200
nothing prevents you to say on the

816
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,919
meaningless i have open three four five

817
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,399
a github issue and that counts right

818
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,879
musically

819
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,039
yeah thanks sir

820
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,520
yeah i guess as

821
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,440
as an author i i'd also like to point

822
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,559
out that

823
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,360
contributing to the document by uh

824
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,679
you know commenting and opening issues

825
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,200
does not imply

826
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,399
support for

827
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,720
getting the document to the you know for

828
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,799
advancing the document uh

829
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,520
through last call um this is these are

830
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,520
two separate things and while we are are

831
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,919
very grateful we we need a

832
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,320
i would say we need a separate uh

833
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
confirmation of that well what

834
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,159
regardless of the venue

835
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,480
uh but yeah the mailing list

836
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,159
as eric said is the

837
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,600
is the normative one there

838
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,399
uh okay uh renin

839
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,919
uh i would be happy to uh review the

840
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,159
document as well uh i just want to say

841
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,279
the document looks really good

842
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,039
there are good comparing and contrasting

843
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,799
of various options

844
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,799
and section 7 is comprehensive but i'll

845
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,399
i'll definitely review it over the

846
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,159
mailing list as well and thanks to the

847
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,480
authors for putting up putting together

848
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,120
this document

849
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,480
great thanks i guess

850
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,480
i have i have one question also that

851
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,399
occurred to me like in in some other

852
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,480
working groups i've seen like

853
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,320
a request to send like we're not aware

854
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,120
of any ipr for all the authors and maybe

855
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,440
we support advancing this document also

856
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,039
i i didn't do that i kind of forgot

857
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,720
that should i

858
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,120
i guess

859
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,480
i don't know what our process is here

860
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,840
exactly

861
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,000
yeah well i mean welcome you're you're

862
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,159
our first document for this working

863
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,080
group so um i think we're kind of

864
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,320
figuring out what our process is as well

865
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,559
as you know as we'll get into a little

866
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,440
later

867
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,480
dealing with the fact that we're not

868
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,399
actually meeting in person and

869
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,399
um kind of struggling to

870
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,159
the dichotomy is not i don't think the

871
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,000
dichotomy is between github and the

872
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,440
mailing list i think the dichotomy is

873
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,039
between people who come to the meetings

874
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,080
and people who participate on the

875
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,360
mailing list

876
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,240
um

877
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,279
so

878
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,640
uh

879
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,720
i think it would be fine and helpful for

880
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,000
the for the

881
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,399
the authors to do that i think that i

882
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,320
mean i as i said i think we need to take

883
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,039
some names and and already got one

884
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,399
um

885
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,600
i'm i'm

886
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,240
yeah i'm appreciative of

887
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,480
glenn's offer to take this to a wider

888
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,000
audience at the same time as you know

889
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,480
we are in last call right this is not a

890
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,840
what document would you write if you

891
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,320
were writing a document request this is

892
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,159
a is this document in reasonable shape

893
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,840
to meet its objectives

894
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,360
yes no what can we do to fix it um

895
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,120
kind of

896
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,320
call

897
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,720
ali

898
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,039
so to jake's question uh uh at least uh

899
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,760
when i was a working group chair

900
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,159
i you know as the chair i asked the

901
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,840
group whether there was any ipr

902
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,679
considerations from anybody not just

903
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,600
authors obviously anybody from the

904
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,640
working group

905
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,519
and

906
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,679
but beyond that since this is an

907
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,679
informational document

908
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,519
i'm not sure whether the ipr

909
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,720
declarations do apply to this one

910
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,279
maybe they still do i don't know but uh

911
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,519
since

912
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,279
yeah i think the ipr

913
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,440
as in the note well ipr always applies

914
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,279
but what i got out of jake's comment was

915
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,000
the and i support the document

916
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,760
you know explicitly sending the note to

917
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,679
the mailing list to say that

918
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,399
the support for it

919
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,600
well i don't think we will have any

920
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,760
concerns jake anyway i just wanted to

921
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,679
point to that

922
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,000
thank you

923
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,799
all right uh that is it then um i guess

924
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,640
if nobody else has comments i don't know

925
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,720
if you guys

926
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,000
uh

927
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,320
want to run a poll in the room or

928
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,320
we'll just do the list but um

929
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,200
yeah and and i guess um kyle what do you

930
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,440
think i would be happy to to get more

931
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,360
names from people here who are willing

932
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,200
to go through the document and you know

933
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
send a thumbs up or questions to the

934
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,480
mailing list

935
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,679
i don't know if you want to do that as a

936
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,200
poll if we want to ask people to

937
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,399
volunteer

938
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,320
in in the

939
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,839
in the chat or

940
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,839
um if we just want to take the mailing

941
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,320
the attendance list and send mail to

942
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,679
everybody i'm not above mail spam i mean

943
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,760
yeah i i think volunteering in the chat

944
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,639
seems fine i'm not sure if the polls are

945
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,159
are anonymous or not and if they're

946
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,839
anonymous they wouldn't that

947
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,839
isn't going to help too much i can't

948
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,599
i don't think i've run a poll

949
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,639
uh through medico so okay

950
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,159
i think we did last time but i could be

951
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,800
wrong about that um all right

952
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,159
i don't remember what you know what i

953
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,239
ate for breakfast this morning so

954
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,079
i just remember the very clicky keyboard

955
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,480
in the last meeting um

956
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,119

961
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,119

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,560
yeah i think i think we are i think we

976

977
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,320

great you jake and co-authors and thank

979
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,000
you everyone who has volunteered

980
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,960
all right

981
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,560
uh so now

982
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,760
on to um the media operations use case

983
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,520
for an augmented reality application on

984
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,599
edge computing infrastructure well

985
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,680
leslie i have a question uh before we

986
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,000
move on

987
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,839
so uh

988
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,920
as you will remember we decided to have

989
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,680
a live document

990
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,119
at the end of the

991
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,839
rfc eventually and

992
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,839
we haven't really received anything from

993
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:30,880
the

994
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,839
rfc editor at this point but uh

995
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:34,800
if

996
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,640
maybe maybe it needs to be taken care of

997
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,800
during the last call as well maybe ad or

998
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,960
someone else needs to make that clear

999
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,760
uh

1000
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,079
at this point we have a tiny url link

1001
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,680
that you know links to the google

1002
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,240
document uh but eventually we want to

1003
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,760
have a

1004
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,440
base in the you know somewhere in the

1005
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,960
atf domain so

1006
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,440
if anybody has any idea how to do it or

1007
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,200
maybe whether we should take an action

1008
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,320
at this point to to do that uh it might

1009
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,079
be good to check as well

1010
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,440
yeah that's that's that's a good

1011
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,040
question thanks for bringing that back

1012
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,440
up um

1013
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,560
i suspect it's something that we'll have

1014
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,400
to deal with either in working group

1015
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,599
last call or ietf wide last call um and

1016
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,079
see if it's get us to a point where

1017
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,160
everyone is comfortable that we have a

1018
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,720
usable answer but um

1019
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,320
i don't i don't think we're quite there

1020
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,720
today

1021
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,119
cool

1022
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,040
all right over to you uh raymond

1023
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,480
can you hear me

1024
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,800
okay so my name is

1025
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,880
krishna and i will be presenting an

1026
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,560
update to our draft

1027
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:17,040
this is a joint work with akbar rahman

1028
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,800
[Music]

1029
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,920
so updates to the draft are in section

1030
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,520
3.1

1031
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,599
we have also added a new section 5 to

1032
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,839
the draft we will talk about these

1033
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,839
changes in the next few slides

1034
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,280
the updates are in the form of

1035
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,160
reorganizing section 3.1 around the

1036
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,280
notion of ar data processing pipeline

1037
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,520
we have also added section 5 where we

1038
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,839
summarize the network characteristics of

1039
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,720
ar application traffic as well as tcp's

1040
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,119
interaction with 4g lte network carrying

1041
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,640
ar traffic

1042
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,920
so let us look at those updates

1043
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,480
in section 3.1 we gave a brief sketch of

1044
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,960
an ar data processing pipeline that

1045
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,839
consists of three consecutive subtasks

1046
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,680
namely tracking followed by an

1047
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,680
acquisition of a model of the real world

1048
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,560
and finally registration

1049
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,079
firstly we need to track the

1050
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,839
three-dimensional coordinates and

1051
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,599
six-dimensional pose that includes

1052
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,839
coordinates and orientation of objects

1053
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,599
in the real world

1054
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,440
these track natural features are then

1055
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,760
used to develop an annotated point

1056
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,680
cloud-based model

1057
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,280
finally the coordinate systems

1058
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,359
brightness and color of virtual and real

1059
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,599
objects need to be aligned in a process

1060
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,880
called registration

1061
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,119
in addition to the requirements for abr

1062
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,680
algorithms there are other operational

1063
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,680
issues that need to be considered for ar

1064
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,839
use cases such as the one described in

1065
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,280
this draft

1066
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,440
in a study conducted to characterize

1067
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,640
multi-user ar or cellular networks the

1068
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,480
following issues were identified and

1069
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,200
have been added in section 5.

1070
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,680
firstly the uploading of data from an ar

1071
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,800
device to a remote server for processing

1072
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,200
dominates the end-to-end latency

1073
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,599
secondly a lack of visual features in

1074
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,680
the grid environment can cause increased

1075
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,079
latencies as the ar device uploads

1076
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,319
additional visual data for processing to

1077
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,920
the remote server

1078
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,160
finally ar applications tend to have

1079
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,400
large bursts that are separated by

1080
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,480
significant time gaps

1081
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,720
as a result the tcp congestion window

1082
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,040
enters slow start before the large

1083
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,359
bursts of data arrive increasing the

1084
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,000
perceived user latency

1085
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,400
the study quoted in the draft shows that

1086
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,440
segmentation latency at the rlc layer

1087
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,599
impacts tcp's performance during slow

1088
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,839
start

1089
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,680
we would like to thank spencer dawkins

1090
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,560
rohit abhishek and jake holland for

1091
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,400
providing very helpful feedback on the

1092
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,000
mailing list

1093
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,599
we would give our detailed response to

1094
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,319
the feedback on the mailing list

1095
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:13,920
we would like to take this opportunity

1096
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,160
to invite reviewers and contributors to

1097
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,240
improve the draft the draft is now on

1098
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,480
good help many thanks to kyle rose for

1099
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,160
helping out

1100
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,000
as a starting point for our discussion

1101
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,839
as spencer has suggested in the mailing

1102
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,160
list for future versions of the draft we

1103
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,440
could abstract out from just discussing

1104
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,000
the particulars of ar applications using

1105
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,760
resources on the edge

1106
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,319
to the general idea of deploying edge

1107
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,440
resources for arvr and 360 degree

1108
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,760
streaming type applications

1109
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,520
so this is essentially up to the working

1110
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,200
group to agree whether that is the

1111
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,599
correct scope of the draft

1112
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,200
additionally

1113
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,880
from our perspective the intended

1114
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,280
audience for this draft is network

1115
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,960
operators

1116
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,880
so with the chair's permission we'd like

1117
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,839
to open the floor for a discussion

1118
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,200
chris

1119
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,200
yeah so um i read the draft um

1120
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,680
uh it looks it it's an excellent start

1121
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,640
um i think um i agree with a lot of the

1122
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,000
feedback that's already been given on

1123
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,319
the list and i apologize for not getting

1124
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:29,920
my feedback on the list before the

1125
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,359
meeting

1126
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,760
i said that i wouldn't i didn't

1127
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,359
but i will get you some feedback um

1128
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,440
one of the things i did observe is that

1129
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,319
the

1130
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:41,440
um

1131
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,280
there's a lot of discussion about

1132
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,440
generation and processing

1133
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,160
on the device itself

1134
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,040
and

1135
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,839
with the intended audience is you know

1136
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,440
network operators

1137
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,640
um

1138
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,240
to me it was in concretely it was not

1139
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,800
concretely tied enough to

1140
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,359
what's happening on the network and

1141
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,599
where those latencies are coming from

1142
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,400
and

1143
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
time budget being spent in one place

1144
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,839
versus another

1145
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,280
um

1146
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,200
uh uh

1147
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,880
it wasn't clear to me

1148
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,800
how those things were related

1149
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,319
um

1150
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,319
and as a network uh

1151
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,960
uh person trying to read this

1152
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,839
um

1153
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:27,839
uh that was confusing to me

1154
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,160
yeah thanks chris for the comments uh

1155
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,480
definitely we can uh

1156
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,040
add more text to the draft clarifying

1157
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,319
uh

1158
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,040
in more precise terms what are the

1159
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,319
various steps which take the uh which

1160
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,520
make up the whole uh time budget uh i'd

1161
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,400
also like to add here that uh the

1162
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,960
description of the various ar processes

1163
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,359
are just a brief sketch

1164
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,200
they are not meant to be comprehensive

1165
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,440
if someone is interested in a

1166
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,599
comprehensive discussion they can look

1167
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:00,960
at the references

1168
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,160
so the the discussion of er is is

1169
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,760
deliberately kept very

1170
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,280
brief

1171
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,000
but yeah we are open to more suggestions

1172
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,160
there any other immediate questions for

1173
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,560
renin

1174
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,560
so um

1175
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,880
i appreciate that you will go through

1176
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,200
the detailed responses on the mailing

1177
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,319
list which is

1178
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,079
absolutely appropriate because there

1179
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,760
were some some good in-depth uh reviews

1180
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,079
um but i did think it would be worth it

1181
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,400
if the working group would actually um

1182
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,480
yeah if the working group would

1183
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,800
here discuss a little bit more about one

1184
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,560
of the points that jake raised which is

1185
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,800
you know whether whether this document

1186
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,400
as it stands is

1187
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,960
straddling at least two worlds and best

1188
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,480
pick which one

1189
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,800
um

1190
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,720
i don't know reena if you want to

1191
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,280
address that at all now or if we should

1192
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,160
open the floor to other comments and ask

1193
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,640
jake to reiterate that point

1194
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,599
no absolutely i think uh i'll give my uh

1195
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,119
comments on that and i'll definitely

1196
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,800
want to hear what the working group uh

1197
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,079
wants to say

1198
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,400
uh so i think both spencer and jake have

1199
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,400
raised this issue of uh the scope and uh

1200
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,920
the intended audience of the document

1201
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,240
um so what we

1202
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,880
want to do with the document is to

1203
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,319
uh make it uh sort of as as

1204
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,359
i said

1205
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,800
uh abstract out of the particulars of ar

1206
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,960
applications and

1207
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,599
and discuss what are the implications of

1208
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,760
not only air but vr and 360 degree

1209
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,680
streaming applications

1210
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,400
on the utility of edge computing

1211
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,119
resources so as uh spencer put it i

1212
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,359
think uh he said that reasons to deploy

1213
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,599
edge computing uh with the reasons not

1214
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,839
being about specific applications so i

1215
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,440
think that would be a

1216
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,720
from my perspective that would be a

1217
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,160
really nice direction to go to but i

1218
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,520
want to hear what the working group

1219
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,759
thinks

1220
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,280
as would we

1221
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,560
does anybody want to wade in

1222
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,680
i think uh

1223
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,040
yeah go ahead kyle share your thoughts

1224
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,280
well yeah so speaking as a participant

1225
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,480
rather than

1226
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,079
rather than as a

1227
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,440
as a chair i just say that it feels like

1228
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,720
the

1229
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,960
the problems that the ar draft is trying

1230
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,200
to address are not specific to

1231
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,680
to augmented reality they're much more

1232
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,760
general and it seems to be that

1233
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,480
it seems it seems to me that there's a

1234
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,359
there's a large class of interactive

1235
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,200
applications

1236
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,839
that need really low latency which

1237
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,000
implies things about

1238
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,160
where compute is located how quickly

1239
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,280
objects can be fetched how you know and

1240
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,599
what constraints like physics has on how

1241
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,280
close those things need to be to you in

1242
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,200
order to achieve a desired level of

1243
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,400
latency

1244
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:26,820
um

1245
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,240
[Music]

1246
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,359
that i i sort of i guess one of my fears

1247
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,800
is that the is that by using

1248
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,440
by by having the you know the the term

1249
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,920
ar in the title and having it be focused

1250
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,440
directly on that use case that a lot of

1251
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,280
people would be like augmented reality

1252
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,720
i'm not doing that even though the

1253
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,240
concerns

1254
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,200
would be

1255
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,960
would be shared by a much larger group

1256
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,640
of people anyway i just wanted to throw

1257
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,599
that out there that's something that

1258
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,960
i've been sitting on for a while

1259
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,839
yeah and i i think uh i would agree with

1260
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,800
that as the draft progress we have

1261
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,880
realized that its

1262
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,280
scope should broaden or or more

1263
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,880
precisely you should abstract out of

1264
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,839
particular er applications into more

1265
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,359
general issues

1266
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,280
uh which

1267
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,200
resources on the edge can can help

1268
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,200
mitigate

1269
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,119
um jake

1270
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,119
right so that that was uh one of the

1271
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,480
options so that's good that we're

1272
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,440
hearing uh plus ones to that side of it

1273
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,480
um

1274
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,599
i guess

1275
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,280
i would say that there are some

1276
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,559
so

1277
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:39,839
uh like

1278
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,319
uh like renown was saying i think

1279
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,760
there's

1280
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,240
uh there are some tighter constraints

1281
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,319
for

1282
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,800
that come from the head motion kind of

1283
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,640
constraints then

1284
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,240
basically anything i've heard of yet

1285
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,079
including gaming like for that one

1286
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,319
you're looking at maybe i think last i

1287
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:01,200
saw a 45 millisecond total budget but

1288
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,599
this one's more like 15 at the outside

1289
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,520
if i remember right so

1290
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,760
um that's a significant difference

1291
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,839
that's

1292
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,040
that's a scope constraint potentially

1293
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,400
but

1294
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,680
i just

1295
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,359
do you ha you know you said there are

1296
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:18,720
many applications that need it did you

1297
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,359
have others in mind here kyle uh so

1298
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,160
besides ar we are 360 degrees

1299
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,319
streaming there is also

1300
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:27,280
a

1301
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,839
certain uh

1302
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:32,480
vehicular use cases that would require

1303
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,440
edge computing resources certain iot use

1304
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,599
cases as well

1305
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,319
and

1306
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,319
the one common thread across all of

1307
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,160
those applications is

1308
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,040
the requirement for low latency and also

1309
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,599
the fact that the devices are typically

1310
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:48,559
uh

1311
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,040
battery driven and so that

1312
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,119
limits the amount of resources that is

1313
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,240
available

1314
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,640
and that also causes this

1315
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,400
heat problem that also causes the

1316
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,240
battery drainage problem

1317
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,440
so uh so across all of those kinds of

1318
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,319
use cases you have these similar

1319
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:07,760
requirements

1320
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,640
and

1321
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,280
they can be mitigated by uh various

1322
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,359
engineering solutions involving edge

1323
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,920
resources

1324
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,839
so that so that's interesting um

1325
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,880
yeah i mean i guess i guess it almost

1326
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,800
seems like there are

1327
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,640
like there are two levels of docs that

1328
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,960
are that are wanted here because there

1329
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,480
are

1330
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,480
there's a unique combination of problems

1331
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,520
uh that augmented reality and and

1332
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,880
virtual reality um

1333
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,000
uh share

1334
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:45,280
uh

1335
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,119
but the individual problems are then

1336
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,119
then overlap with other areas so it's

1337
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,640
almost like you want

1338
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,640
the augmented reality problem statement

1339
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,440
and then have that refer to

1340
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,000
you know up to two other

1341
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,680
to documents and other areas that are

1342
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,680
addressing subsets of that problem does

1343
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,319
that make sense

1344
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:12,240
uh yeah what i would say is that um the

1345
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,440
at the operational level as spencer says

1346
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,640
in his mail

1347
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,559
uh there are a lot of things like the

1348
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,319
choice of the transport protocol that

1349
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,240
are not necessarily

1350
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,200
uh

1351
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,440
decided by the network operators but by

1352
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,240
the

1353
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,000
by the application developers and that

1354
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,400
that that then means that at the network

1355
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,480
operator level uh there are these uh

1356
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,119
these paired uh sort of uh traffic

1357
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,240
patterns

1358
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,400
uh that they need to deal with to

1359
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,160
provide certain say uh qoe so qci comes

1360
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,319
to mind which are provided by

1361
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:49,119
uh

1362
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,200
4g and 5g vendors

1363
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,559
so uh

1364
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,359
so yes there is a set of um

1365
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,119
let's say requirements

1366
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,880
uh posed by the

1367
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,119
by the ar application

1368
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,000
which are also then

1369
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,480
the requirements for other kinds of

1370
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,440
applications like uh certain iot

1371
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,839
applications or autonomous cycles etc

1372
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:18,400
etc so i think the fact that um that you

1373
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,839
can use

1374
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,720
uh engineering solutions load balancing

1375
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,800
deciding where to offload when to

1376
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,800
offload those sorts of things

1377
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,760
uh

1378
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,680
in combination with with

1379
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,359
the edge devices

1380
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,319
is is sort of a common thread across all

1381
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,440
these applications i think

1382
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,960
thank you karen

1383
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,680
my apologies i haven't fully read the

1384
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,800
document but i had a curiosity question

1385
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,319
you talked about uh dynamically changing

1386
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:55,839
qoe

1387
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,720
is there any quantitative way to decide

1388
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,119
what is quality of experience are there

1389
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,640
any metrics you have in mind for those

1390
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,359
um so i have

1391
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:09,680
given a reference to that

1392
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,440
and uh

1393
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,680
and typically the

1394
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,839
metrics that the application designers

1395
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,839
come up with have to be tied to actual

1396
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:18,960
network

1397
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,680
uh things like latency and bandwidth

1398
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,800
uh

1399
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,839
so

1400
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,760
so yes there are

1401
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,640
certain uh metrics that you can you can

1402
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,920
use but they need to be translated into

1403
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,280
you know the standard network

1404
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,720
performance

1405
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,240
metrics like latency and memory

1406
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,160
okay yeah i'll review the document and

1407
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,400
provide you more comments on it thank

1408
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,040
you very much

1409
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,119
that's great thank you um i've been

1410
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:50,640
putting myself in queue and coming out

1411
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,960
of queue and in queueing out of cube um

1412
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,160
because the the

1413
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,520
around the question of um you know is do

1414
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,960
we need to capture sort of the use case

1415
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,839
of ar and and and tape it up as the

1416
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,160
target

1417
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,119
it strikes me that we might want to

1418
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,839
articulate that in terms that are

1419
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,440
around what what is it what is special

1420
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,599
about it that requires edge computing

1421
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,599
you've listed a lot of the video related

1422
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,000
ones and which is appropriate for

1423
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,440
mob's document um but it strikes me too

1424
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,599
that it might be worth capturing some of

1425
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,920
the other compute challenges that are

1426
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,680
make it not possible to address these

1427
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,319
issues by traditional

1428
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,319
you know video challenge technologies

1429
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,799
such as cdns

1430
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:41,599
and in particular i'm thinking about

1431
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:46,079
whether it's ar or vr or the metaverse

1432
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,040
the whole notion of synchronization of

1433
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,400
objects

1434
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,520
um or we or shared reality if you will

1435
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,520
um

1436
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,720
and

1437
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,880
how that impacts you know the fact that

1438
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,799
you you really do need to do

1439
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:01,680
local

1440
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,040
you know you need to break the problem

1441
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,040
down based on where you what you're

1442
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,760
competing locally versus what you are

1443
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,000
yeah achieving through communication

1444
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,680
um

1445
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,960
so i don't know if that's useful as a

1446
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,720
means of sort of

1447
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,319
saying you know

1448
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,079
of describing what are the kinds of

1449
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,599
problems you think we're talking about

1450
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,599
here and why is edge computing important

1451
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:25,760
or if it's a complete red herring

1452
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,520
um but

1453
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,119
that's where my thinking was running too

1454
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,280
uh well for

1455
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,480
definitely for ar and vr applications uh

1456
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,599
the the latency is important

1457
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:40,400
and

1458
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,920
one of the reasons why that's important

1459
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,079
is because of synchronization issues

1460
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:45,760
that we have discussing in the draft

1461
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,720
also

1462
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,200
so uh so definitely whether you talk of

1463
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,400
your vr or

1464
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,960
multiverse uh you would need to uh

1465
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,480
you need to think about a

1466
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,160
synchronization

1467
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:58,960
and

1468
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,520
a way to to

1469
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,079
deal with with the latency issues

1470
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,400
uh also because most of these devices

1471
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,920
are on on wireless networks uh that that

1472
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,559
are very variable in their quality so so

1473
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:16,960
uh so yeah definitely synchronization

1474
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,119
and i think part of my point was

1475
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,480
it is the nature of the problem space

1476
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,599
that

1477
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,480
um

1478
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,839
there are certain things that you can

1479
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,440
split across nodes and there are certain

1480
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,520
things you cannot right so i mean it's

1481
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,000
the age-old problem of multi-parallel

1482
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,559
processor computing and shared memory

1483
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,400
and or messaging right when you're

1484
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,160
solving a problem what are the things

1485
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,000
that actually need to happen locally and

1486
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,280
what are the things that can be solved

1487
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,680
by synchronized communication elsewhere

1488
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,119
um and there are some things that just

1489
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:48,720
cannot be

1490
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,000
pushed off

1491
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,200
um

1492
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,559
again i didn't want a rat hole there but

1493
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,960
just in terms of there's a

1494
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,119
if we want to talk about the problem

1495
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,960
space in a means that is somewhat

1496
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,400
agnostic of a particular application

1497
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,000
focusing it on

1498
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,160
you know the level of

1499
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,920
breaking that breaking the problem the

1500
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,920
compute problem apart and what needs to

1501
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,599
be done locally versus not locally and

1502
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,240
therefore what video processing has to

1503
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,920
happen locally versus not locally and

1504
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,760
one of the implications

1505
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,920
might be helpful or as i said it might

1506
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,040
be a complete red herring

1507
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,599
uh no i think it's a it's a very valid

1508
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,680
point and if i just off the top of my

1509
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,760
head if i recall the

1510
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,559
uh

1511
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:35,200
uh satyanarayan and paper that we have

1512
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,920
referenced in the draft they talk about

1513
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,400
uh three tires so

1514
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,520
you have the

1515
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,799
the the actual device you have the

1516
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:47,520
edge and you have the cloud

1517
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,400
and the device actually represents the

1518
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,480
design considerations of mobility and

1519
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,480
sensing whereas the edge

1520
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,000
deals with the design consideration of

1521
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,680
network proximity

1522
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,839
and the cloud deals with the design

1523
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:04,480
consideration of i think compute

1524
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,359
elasticity storage permanence and

1525
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,920
hardware consolidation and within these

1526
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,920
design constraints you

1527
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,680
i guess

1528
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,640
you need to consider

1529
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,240
synchronization

1530
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,520
and how it is affected by the

1531
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:26,240
special nature of arvr applications

1532
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:32,319
okay

1533
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,520
um

1534
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,119
so i think

1535
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,000
i don't see anyone else in queue uh so i

1536
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,160
think that the next steps are renin

1537
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,480
you're planning a more detailed response

1538
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,079
to the comments received on the mailing

1539
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,040
list on the mailing list um i will take

1540
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,119
this opportunity to

1541
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:51,280
observe that the document is now in

1542
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,680
github and thanks to you and kyle for

1543
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,760
getting that sorted so people who prefer

1544
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,160
to do github-based engagement

1545
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,400
can now do so

1546
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,240
and we've picked up at least one more

1547
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,799
person offering to do review it was

1548
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:06,640
karen who had offered to do a review of

1549
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,200
the document and please share comments

1550
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,200
with mailing list is there anything else

1551
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,520
that we should cover here today

1552
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,839
on this topic

1553
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,799
okay all right thank you very much reena

1554
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,119
and um

1555
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,880
we'll head to the mailing list kyle you

1556
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,280
were gonna say something

1557
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,119
no no i was just gonna i was just gonna

1558
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:37,040
say our our our next speaker is spencer

1559
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,880
who may need to extricate himself from

1560
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,119
his other meeting

1561
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,040
thank you everyone thanks

1562
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,079
thank you

1563
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:47,319
thanks renen

1564
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,280
spencer

1565
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,119
sorry for the delay we'll we'll we'll be

1566
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:30,480
with everyone in a moment we're just

1567
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,119
trying to get spencer's attention

1568
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,359
if not we can move on to the

1569
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:38,839
to the next item

1570
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,200
okay so i think that we probably should

1571
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,839
do that um we'll tell in the chat we

1572
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:06,559
will tell spencer that we've

1573
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,720
reordered the agenda

1574
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,680
um

1575
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,599
and if you can't join us then i think we

1576
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:14,160
can probably speak from his notes to the

1577
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,319
mailing list

1578
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,960
um i think there were some good

1579
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,200
discussion points there yeah

1580
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,359
okay all right

1581
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:27,040
uh lee if you could

1582
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,640
give us your update on the packet

1583
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,920
differences yes thank you

1584
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:32,960
should i

1585
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,000
if if you want to share uh slides you

1586
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,240
can click on the share preloaded slides

1587
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,640
button at the top left

1588
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,319
and then select your your deck

1589
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:49,359
presentation review

1590
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:51,839
which one

1591
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,920
okay got it

1592
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,880
yes

1593
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,839
so can you see my

1594
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:21,039
screen uh yeah we're looking at your

1595
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,119
screen as opposed to the slides that

1596
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,079
were uh that were in the uh

1597
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:27,520
uh

1598
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,280
that we uploaded from the data tracker

1599
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,119
but it's fine

1600
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:32,240
you might want to put it into

1601
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,079
presentation mode though so we don't see

1602
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:36,640
all of the

1603
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,240
okay right now

1604
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,160
yep that looks good okay

1605
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,319
yeah great um

1606
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:45,119
so um i wanna have a summary of the

1607
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,920
feedback that i received from the last

1608
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,839
meeting

1609
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:52,480
so the comments were i think in summary

1610
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,960
i think the comments are mainly related

1611
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,520
to how to review the characteristics of

1612
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,160
the microblocks containing the packets

1613
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,319
to the network and implement the

1614
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:05,039
selective packet dropping at the packet

1615
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,680
level so i want to emphasize on the

1616
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,400
packet level so i'm very glad that the

1617
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,680
concept is very um well received in my

1618
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:17,920
mind and we think it is beneficial to

1619
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,920
improve the quality of experience of

1620
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,480
video streaming by reducing the package

1621
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,520
dropping

1622
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,720
granularity from the current traffic

1623
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,039
class level to the individual packet

1624
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:31,200
level which means

1625
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,119
inside a flow

1626
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,480
each individual packet may have its own

1627
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,319
significance level

1628
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:40,880
and the router could treat those

1629
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,000
individual packets differently

1630
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,200
or even within the within the packet

1631
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,400
itself

1632
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,599
um

1633
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:52,559
yes and we need such information of

1634
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:54,559
whether this packet is significant or

1635
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:57,520
not to be reviewed network nodes

1636
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,559
for example

1637
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:01,200
api could be implemented to

1638
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,680
input such information or metadata from

1639
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,240
the application which might be mapped to

1640
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,520
the you know ipv6 extension header or

1641
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,640
ipv4 options or a dedicated metadata

1642
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,799
field in the ip header

1643
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:17,920
um you know and i want to thank um

1644
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,240
drake about the you know the for the

1645
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,200
reply in the email list um we will take

1646
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,920
a closer look at your your comments

1647
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,920
because we haven't gotten much time in

1648
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,359
the morning to read carefully about each

1649
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:33,039
sentence in the email

1650
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:36,799
um and we will reply you later offline

1651
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:37,839
um

1652
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:39,039
but um

1653
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:40,319
for the

1654
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:43,680
for the div serve i want to say is the

1655
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,240
traffic management is at the class level

1656
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,920
which means the ad router will look into

1657
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,039
some

1658
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:53,359
uh fields like source destination

1659
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:56,480
addresses and flow id to map

1660
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,440
traffic to map list packet to certain

1661
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,839
traffic class which means

1662
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:04,559
that inside of flow

1663
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,400
the packets would have the same

1664
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,400
significance

1665
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:13,440
if this server is used but yes i will

1666
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,920
carry the discussion offline in an email

1667
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,240
list

1668
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:19,599
next

1669
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:22,160
i want to talk a bit more on the major

1670
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,799
characteristics of video frames that

1671
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,880
could affect the significance of a

1672
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,640
single packet

1673
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,440
the first one is the frame type we all

1674
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,160
know pack 4 has you know have

1675
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,039
three types of frames iframe is

1676
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:38,480
self-contained

1677
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,920
so which means

1678
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,720
it will have no references to other

1679
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,000
frames and it is encoded by itself and

1680
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,200
it is the keyframe that provides

1681
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,119
checkpoints for re-synchronized

1682
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,079
synchronization or re-entry to support

1683
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,640
trig modes and aerial

1684
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,000
recovery

1685
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,640
um we we can think this is most

1686
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:03,359
important type of frames uh in a whole

1687
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:06,000
stream and p frame

1688
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,880
is the predictive frame which means

1689
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,960
it can allow macroblocks to be

1690
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,319
compressed using temporal prediction in

1691
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:16,079
addition to spatial

1692
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,880
prediction so for a motion estimation

1693
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,880
keyframes could use frames that have

1694
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,760
been previously encoded it could be a

1695
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,720
proof p frame it could be iframe

1696
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,880
so for a b frame it stands for

1697
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,559
bi-directional

1698
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:33,359
uh frames which means i will refer to

1699
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:35,680
the frames that occur both before and

1700
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:36,720
after it

1701
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,119
so each macro block of a b frame can be

1702
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:42,880
predicted using backward prediction or

1703
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,839
using forward

1704
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:47,359
prediction so accordingly

1705
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:48,160
um

1706
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,280
the next characteristic i want to point

1707
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:54,400
out is the whether the packet contains

1708
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,240
frame that are referenced by other

1709
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,280
frames so according to this prediction

1710
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,920
relationship among different frames so

1711
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,079
each frame might be referenced by other

1712
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:05,440
frames

1713
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,520
um

1714
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,160
so for iframe the iframe does not refer

1715
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:14,160
to any other frame so is is at least but

1716
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,799
it is at least referenced by a keyframe

1717
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,839
after it so the losing the first iframe

1718
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:22,400
in the group of pictures would cause

1719
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,480
videos picture even missing a few

1720
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,760
seconds

1721
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,960
um because p and b frames referencing to

1722
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,359
i from it would not be decoded nor

1723
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:34,480
displayed either for a p frame it

1724
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,720
because it refers to a picture in the

1725
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:37,839
past

1726
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:39,280
um

1727
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,680
however you also might be referenced by

1728
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,039
a p frame after it or a b frame before

1729
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:46,880
or after it

1730
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,960
and for a b frame

1731
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,720
can i it can also act as a reference

1732
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:55,680
in the real case it's not a common case

1733
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,480
so if b frame is referenced by others it

1734
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,880
is termed as a reference b frame

1735
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,359
but in the normal case or you know

1736
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:06,079
common case the b frame is not used as a

1737
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:08,319
reference so it is usually called as

1738
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:11,839
non-reference b frame

1739
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,720
another important characteristic of

1740
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,198
impact video packets is the movement

1741
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:19,198
level of the video sample contained in

1742
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:20,719
the packet

1743
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:23,120
the video things with the low level

1744
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,759
movement or less sensitive to both b

1745
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:28,158
frame and p frame packet loss for

1746
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:30,158
example if right now we are having a

1747
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:34,560
conference call my background or um

1748
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,920
my body if i did not move much

1749
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,560
it has very low level movement contained

1750
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,839
in the video

1751
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:43,439
so the

1752
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:46,238
the video things with you know were not

1753
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:48,560
very sensitive to the b frame or p frame

1754
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,040
packet loss but on the other hand if

1755
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,640
you're watching football

1756
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:57,120
uh video on live video um it is um

1757
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,920
you know the movement level is very high

1758
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,640
and you will be very sensitive or more

1759
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,960
sensitive to both b frame and p frame

1760
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:08,560
packet loss so for loss the p frame can

1761
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,839
impact the remaining part of the gop

1762
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:15,520
um or while a lost b frame has only

1763
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,000
local effects you know slowly moving

1764
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,080
content or very large stack background

1765
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,399
like you know my video right now if i'm

1766
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:25,198
sharing so you know think of dynamically

1767
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:27,120
moving content loose

1768
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,279
b frame has more true

1769
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:31,679
magic impact and scale can be as far

1770
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:36,080
reaching as a p frame loss so if we can

1771
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,319
have some level of

1772
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:41,040
estimation or indication of the movement

1773
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,279
level with of the video sample

1774
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,000
containing packets we can

1775
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
you know combine with other knowledge of

1776
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,158
the packet we can

1777
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:51,679
have more

1778
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:54,000
uh information regarding the

1779
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,719
significance of the packet

1780
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:00,000
um the last one i want to point out

1781
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,520
um is the um is whether the video sample

1782
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,840
contained in the packet belongs to

1783
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,800
a region of interest or not

1784
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,679
um the microblocks that are identified

1785
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:15,040
to represent objects in roi are more

1786
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,120
important than other microblocks of

1787
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,199
non-roi regions

1788
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,760
for example we are watching a video

1789
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,840
um you are more you are paying more

1790
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,640
attention to certain object or certain

1791
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,360
person in the video than other

1792
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,600
microblocks that are representing other

1793
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,400
objects or background is not are not so

1794
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,520
important

1795
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,159
compared uh compared to the macroblocks

1796
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,000
of the roi

1797
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,120
um so based on those characteristics of

1798
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,760
the mempac video packets you we probably

1799
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,520
could use some

1800
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,440
um

1801
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,000
some way of calculating the import

1802
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,920
importance of those

1803
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,600
of those of the individual packets um i

1804
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,760
did not show here in the

1805
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,719
in the slides but what i can think of

1806
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:06,000
is you know based on the frame type we

1807
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,400
think that iframe is the most important

1808
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,480
so we probably give more

1809
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,440
uh

1810
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,920
weight to the eye frame frame and for

1811
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,840
those frames that are referenced by

1812
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,080
others are would be given more um weight

1813
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,320
and for the movement based on the

1814
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,760
movement level

1815
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,159
you know if the movement level is high

1816
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:29,040
then the b frame and p frame would would

1817
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,320
have more

1818
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,560
importance or more weight than

1819
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,280
uh b frame and p frame with less

1820
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,719
movement

1821
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:38,960
and then you know if

1822
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,480
would think the the pack leaf has roi uh

1823
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:46,239
object then maybe we have higher weights

1824
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:48,960
so we can combine all those factors

1825
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,760
uh into um a

1826
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,320
certain calculation method i i

1827
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,800
personally i don't have a good answer

1828
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,679
but we can think of one light by putting

1829
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:00,960
different

1830
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,600
weights on those important things

1831
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,920
then maybe we can come up of a

1832
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,640
significant level force or individual

1833
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,159
packets

1834
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,040
so

1835
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,880
uh here is the summary of the

1836
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,760
requirements of network and applications

1837
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,719
uh so we think the application needs to

1838
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:21,520
in order to make this work we need it

1839
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,520
needs to reveal some information to

1840
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,560
network to enable is selective packet

1841
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,679
dropping you know examples could be you

1842
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,920
know receiving any users rough

1843
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,880
preference on the media quality so what

1844
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,120
is your tolerance quality degradation

1845
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,440
regarding to the example

1846
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:43,440
uh resolution so if you are watching uh

1847
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,360
um

1848
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,120
before you know 4k video uh is it is it

1849
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:54,080
okay for you to watch uh um you know 480

1850
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,600
uh p video or not if it is okay maybe uh

1851
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,239
some of the packets does not need do not

1852
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:01,360
need to be

1853
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:04,000
dropped um but those you know like the

1854
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,520
iframes should be

1855
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,159
maintained other frames could be dropped

1856
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:10,480
and other things like the characteristic

1857
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:14,320
of the media content i presented earlier

1858
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,800
and also um you know

1859
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,760
like are for example the ior the frame

1860
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:20,640
type

1861
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,199
um whether the pack contains frames that

1862
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,120
are referenced by others and

1863
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,199
correspondingly the network should be

1864
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:30,400
able to leverage above information

1865
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,719
reviewed by the application and then

1866
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:36,159
selectively drop packets or

1867
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:39,120
potentially parts of the packets from

1868
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:42,719
com from competing media stream flows

1869
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:45,920
um and re-transmission we can think in

1870
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,000
that way re-transmission could be

1871
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,640
maximally eliminated because some of the

1872
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,480
packets

1873
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,719
that are important have already received

1874
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:56,880
by the receiver and the receiver can

1875
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,120
accept this qualitative degree

1876
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,040
qualitative degradation

1877
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:04,159
then other parts of the packets do not

1878
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,159
to be retransmitted again

1879
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:08,880
so the receiving end user is able to

1880
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,760
consume in the uh deliver packets as

1881
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,880
many as possible in time with acceptable

1882
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,040
quality

1883
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,239
and this is the slide i added just now

1884
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:22,239
those are the references to papers we

1885
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:25,040
have published and the very first one

1886
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:28,640
which we will publish in 2018 and the

1887
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,159
recent one

1888
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,640
that were very relevant to this paper oh

1889
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,239
sorry to this

1890
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:37,679
uh contribution is this one the um

1891
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,440
the coded communication for emerging

1892
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,560
network applications with new iep which

1893
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,679
is to be appeared as a invited paper in

1894
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:48,080
proceedings of the um

1895
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:51,040
17th international offers on mobility

1896
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,360
sensing and networking

1897
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,400
okay that's all for my presentation i

1898
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:00,639
would like to see any comments

1899
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,960
jake

1900
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,000
um

1901
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,080
the uh

1902
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,679
i guess i'd like to

1903
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,560
to clarify um i think you characterize

1904
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,840
the

1905
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,760
responses as

1906
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,520
positive so far i'm not sure i would

1907
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,840
call my view on this positive at this

1908
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:30,719
stage

1909
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:33,120
uh i think there might be potential here

1910
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:37,040
but what i'd be interested to see is um

1911
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,560
it so first off i think the the problem

1912
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,239
of differential

1913
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:43,600
dropping that you communicate to the

1914
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,560
network

1915
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,520
is exactly what diffserv can do and

1916
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,199
that's a that's a good approach that's a

1917
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:51,280
much better approach in my opinion than

1918
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,040
um

1919
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,120
uh option header

1920
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,520
ideas that you mentioned um but i think

1921
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,560
there are

1922
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,040
challenges uh and that you you'd have to

1923
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,600
be looking at a controlled uh

1924
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,560
at a controlled network either way

1925
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,360
so

1926
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,400
i guess

1927
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:11,360
what i'm interested in is basically

1928
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,640
really what do you gain out of this i

1929
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,640
think this is a thing that you can do in

1930
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,800
experiment already i'd like to see

1931
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,800
quantitative

1932
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,800
results discussing it

1933
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,640
in terms of uh user q08 qoe before i'd

1934
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,920
like to see this um

1935
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,159
really

1936
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:33,199
given a lot more time

1937
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,800
but uh

1938
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,400
that's just kind of

1939
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,560
my view i think it's it's a potentially

1940
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,920
interesting thing

1941
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,199
but

1942
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:42,960
like

1943
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,840
the the fact that iframes are different

1944
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,159
uh does not necessarily imply that

1945
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:49,840
dropping them less often gives you a

1946
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,920
better qoe without the sort of

1947
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,679
measurement to that effect and i guess

1948
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:54,880
i'd like to

1949
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,080
uh

1950
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,600
you know there's probably constraints on

1951
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:58,880
that i guess i'd like to see an

1952
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,280
exploration of what do you actually get

1953
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,920
that's that's my main feedback here but

1954
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,760
thank you

1955
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,800
yeah um no i i did not regard

1956
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,199
regard your email as a

1957
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:14,239
very positive uh feedback but

1958
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:17,199
i do thank you for you know uh replying

1959
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,520
me through the email list giving me

1960
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,560
comments

1961
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:21,520
um

1962
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,640
for deep serve i want to point out it is

1963
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,679
a course-grained class-based mechanism

1964
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,520
for traffic management

1965
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,880
which means at the edge of diffserv

1966
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,159
domain

1967
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:36,960
the edge router would look into the

1968
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,840
source destination addresses and the

1969
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,080
flow id to determine

1970
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:45,600
the you know the dscp value for that

1971
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,400
packet so it does not mean

1972
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,040
the packet within the flow would have

1973
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:55,040
different significance levels or dsap

1974
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,560
assignment

1975
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,199
because the router would only look at

1976
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:01,520
the source and destination and the flow

1977
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,400
id

1978
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,360
we will not look at anything else to

1979
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:08,159
determine this vp value

1980
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:09,840
so within

1981
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,000
i agree if you use the router to set the

1982
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,400
value however i think you can set the

1983
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,040
value at the host and have it

1984
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,440
uh come in with the disk serv id which

1985
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,800
then would be treated differently by the

1986
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,000
router so i guess i'd encourage you to

1987
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,480
look at that instead where the sender

1988
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,640
sets it according to the sock up there's

1989
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,760
the

1990
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,520
iptos

1991
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:33,280
api in in linux for example and if you

1992
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,520
can set that at the host then i think

1993
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,280
you'll be able to perform experiments

1994
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,679
that do not depend on

1995
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:43,040
router understanding the class and just

1996
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,040
use the class just based on the incoming

1997
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,239
diffserv

1998
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:48,400
at the router layer when you try to when

1999
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,480
you try to go between different diffserv

2000
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,120
domains but just to just declare clarify

2001
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,760
that point um but good luck uh that it

2002
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,880
sounds

2003
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,600
interesting if it uh if it really pans

2004
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,560
out so uh you know

2005
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,800
yeah i would take a look take a look at

2006
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:09,120
what you mentioned yes okay

2007
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,400
thanks jake uh magnus

2008
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:16,159
uh yes so i i definitely have to

2009
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:17,840
support one of these comments here

2010
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,040
really about

2011
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,800
do you have any video quality of

2012
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,800
experience results for this type of work

2013
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,040
because i mean i think you presented a

2014
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,920
very simplified view of how the latest

2015
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,360
video codecs achieve their high

2016
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,480
performance

2017
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,440
and and you're down to ipm

2018
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,239
reference structures etc on macrobot

2019
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:38,239
level and then that's

2020
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,560
i mean that's all mixed up so

2021
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,040
for getting this to work properly to my

2022
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,480
understanding you need to ensure that

2023
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,640
you can actually separate out the data

2024
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,159
you want to drop

2025
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:50,159
for both that it works through both your

2026
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:52,080
security solutions and your framing

2027
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,760
solutions

2028
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,719
and formatting yet still get readable by

2029
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:58,400
stream so i mean

2030
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,520
uh

2031
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,760
i i hope you have some

2032
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,000
qe results that you really can show that

2033
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
because before you can show it that even

2034
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,159
get that with the framing in place for

2035
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:10,080
those applications i don't see a point

2036
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,679
of doing this because

2037
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:13,199
i think that's usually being when

2038
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:15,920
looking at this this kind of

2039
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:16,960
barrier

2040
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,239
so it's it's not worth it

2041
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:21,840
yeah yeah

2042
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,000
thank you for your comment yeah yes so

2043
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,199
um

2044
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:29,199
be honest i i my background is not uh um

2045
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:32,080
video coding sites i'm more you know

2046
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,960
networking side or mostly networking

2047
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:35,760
side

2048
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:40,000
so for uh here we want to point out the

2049
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,560
you know there there is um could be

2050
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,560
significance differences among package

2051
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:47,120
by using this use case

2052
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,920
we did some research

2053
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,000
on what are the characteristics could be

2054
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,320
could be leveraged but

2055
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,520
i think those characteristics could be

2056
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,080
you know does do not need to be revealed

2057
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:05,199
to the network uh you want one hand

2058
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:07,440
because you know if we

2059
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,199
could have the help

2060
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:12,080
from the codex or application

2061
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,320
by saying okay list packet

2062
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,480
because it has those uh

2063
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:19,600
kinds of characteristics so i would

2064
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:22,080
um indicate it is more important than

2065
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,639
the other packets in the stream so we

2066
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:27,360
will have the application or codecs to

2067
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,920
do that instead of you know network try

2068
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,600
to tries to understand those

2069
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,120
characteristics

2070
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,719
yeah

2071
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:36,880
sure but i mean the the the issue here

2072
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,639
is that you have a very interactive

2073
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:40,639
system is that if you drop a certain

2074
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:42,800
amount of packets your video quality

2075
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,040
will be

2076
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,880
subjected to different it will really

2077
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,360
get different results and that depends

2078
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,639
on how your system so you actually need

2079
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:53,120
to have it do both parts here to figure

2080
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,800
out and see what results you actually

2081
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,800
can get and that i think is is the kind

2082
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,880
of homework you need to go do here and

2083
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,400
you also say no there's some properties

2084
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,239
here yes you can code those properties

2085
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:04,800
if you can determine which packets etc

2086
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,159
and you can actually cut out the data

2087
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:07,280
but i think you need to start from the

2088
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,520
application and then come to

2089
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,040
what you need from the network i think

2090
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,880
you're kind of starting from network

2091
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,639
here and going backwards so

2092
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:18,239
uh yeah yeah yeah uh i understand uh yes

2093
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:20,239
um i think your comments are very

2094
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:24,480
legitimate um so um yeah

2095
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,880
the application yeah we definitely need

2096
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,520
to support front application side

2097
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,280
because in order to have this

2098
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,480
information

2099
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,960
or the significance of the packet

2100
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,679
known to the to the you know network

2101
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:39,920
list information needs to be calculated

2102
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,600
or some kind of

2103
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,480
a revealing uh front application to the

2104
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:47,360
network and as you said

2105
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,920
dropping some parts some packets may

2106
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,400
result in the quality of quality

2107
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,760
degradation

2108
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,719
but if the any user is able to tolerate

2109
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:57,760
that

2110
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,400
then maybe it is okay

2111
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,719
right so um

2112
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:05,760
as i said if you know i'm watching 4k at

2113
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:09,520
certain point i'm only watching 480p

2114
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,199
i'm okay with that then the

2115
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:14,000
retransmission of those other frames may

2116
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,440
not need it

2117
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,400
but um i think what you commented

2118
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,360
earlier uh very legitimate that the

2119
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:23,760
application does need

2120
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,400
needs to support less kind of operation

2121
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:29,040
in the network

2122
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:32,840
and

2123
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,679
okay all right

2124
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:37,199
all right yeah i closed the queue

2125
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:39,040
because we're we're pretty much out of

2126
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,800
time but uh

2127
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,800
but i want to thank you for doing your

2128
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,800
presentation

2129
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,199
thank you guys thank you very much jake

2130
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:50,960
and others for comments

2131
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:54,639
follow up from the specific discussion

2132
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:57,040
points as this as outlined

2133
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,560
i think the thought people probably want

2134
01:23:58,560 --> 01:23:59,870
to be putting

2135
01:23:59,870 --> 01:24:01,199
[Music]

2136
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:03,920
putting on the table is um if

2137
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,440
if this is going to go forward at the

2138
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,239
itf what is the appropriate place for it

2139
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:10,960
to go uh i don't think the mops working

2140
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,520
group would be the right place but um

2141
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,040
perhaps we can help

2142
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,560
shape it up to the point where it is

2143
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,080
something that can go to another working

2144
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:20,320
group

2145
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:25,440
that would be helpful definitely great

2146
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:29,559
all right thank you um

2147
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:31,520
all right so

2148
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,440
spencer is still

2149
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,040
busy elsewhere

2150
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,320
um

2151
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,760
i don't think we are going to skip right

2152
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,040
over the

2153
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,120
mock item um

2154
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:44,080
i think that we need to

2155
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,760
at least speak a little bit about the

2156
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:47,360
notes that spencer sent to the mailing

2157
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,600
list

2158
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,840
um

2159
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,560
so the media over quick

2160
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,800
side meeting

2161
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,560
occurred earlier this week

2162
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,880
i was not there um i'm probably not the

2163
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:03,360
best person to to present the report out

2164
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,320
from it

2165
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,719
um i don't know if you want to give it a

2166
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:09,199
go kyle or um

2167
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:10,719
if we want to see how much i can make up

2168
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:13,840
on the fly

2169
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:15,280
um

2170
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,880
probably not the i'm probably not the

2171
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,679
right person to do that um

2172
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:22,320
was anyone else there who has uh who

2173
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,199
feels confident enough about the uh

2174
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:27,199
about their uh their understanding of

2175
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:28,719
the outcome

2176
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:33,719
uh you could give a brief summary

2177
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,239
i guess not all right

2178
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:43,120
um

2179
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,360
so

2180
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,840
um spencer as i said forwarded the

2181
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,760
mailing list to point her to his notes

2182
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,400
from the meeting

2183
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,719
luke is in the uh is in the queue now

2184
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:56,880
okay

2185
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,320
luke would you like to take the baton

2186
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,679
um so yeah i was uh i joined like 15

2187
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:07,600
minutes late to the the media of a quick

2188
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,320
mailing list but also being

2189
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,639
kind of responding a bit and

2190
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:14,960
you know even even try to get it formed

2191
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:18,480
um really it comes down to there's a lot

2192
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,719
of different media use cases right

2193
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:21,840
there's a lot of different protocols out

2194
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,120
there you guys you guys know that

2195
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,400
there's um

2196
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,719
uh this whole swap and there's this new

2197
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:30,159
uh transport layer um uh quick

2198
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:32,159
and really this is just an exploration

2199
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:33,920
of uh

2200
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,040
what we could use quick for um

2201
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,560
there are some companies and some

2202
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:41,199
individuals that are using it already to

2203
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:43,840
um to deliver media but most of the

2204
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,159
meeting was about

2205
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,000
what use cases exist

2206
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,679
people speaking up saying like oh we

2207
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:51,920
need seeking support or oh we need you

2208
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,600
know i want peer-to-peer or all this is

2209
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,159
for real time this is for gaming and try

2210
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:57,920
to trying to explore

2211
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,800
what existing standards exist uh at ietf

2212
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,239
and and whatnot uh and also what would

2213
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:06,639
be a good use case for for quick and

2214
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:08,239
what changes would be required for quick

2215
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:09,840
but the meeting didn't really cover that

2216
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:12,000
too much so right now it's still in an

2217
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,360
exploratory phase it's still trying to

2218
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,480
figure out

2219
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:19,280
what working group or groups um

2220
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,159
uh could be created to deal with this um

2221
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:24,480
if they're even necessary uh

2222
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:25,760
and uh

2223
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,840
yeah it's it's it's it's it's a really

2224
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,199
rough state right now just trying to

2225
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:30,880
come up with requirements and kind of

2226
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,360
come up with what desired target use

2227
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,360
cases there are

2228
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,880
okay

2229
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,840
thank you for that and thank you for

2230
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,800
leaping in the last moment

2231
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,040
um my understanding from spencer's notes

2232
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,639
is that a large part of the conclusion

2233
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:48,080
is that it's important to sort of stake

2234
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,920
out you know what use cases people want

2235
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,440
to pursue or at least be clear about

2236
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,760
what use cases are in play

2237
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,480
um i don't know if glenn you want to

2238
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:01,799
speak to your follow-up on that point

2239
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,960
assuming glenn is still here

2240
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:07,360
ben is still here

2241
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,920
yeah either yeah so um and i can't

2242
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,080
remember which lists my comments ended

2243
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,239
up on you last night but i made the

2244
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:16,000
observation that

2245
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,679
you know

2246
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:20,000
this is a pretty big ocean and

2247
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,440
there's lots of different applications

2248
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,280
that something we we

2249
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,080
you know

2250
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:26,000
chewed through when we created mops in

2251
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,120
the first place right just because

2252
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,400
there's so much

2253
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,600
there's some stuff that's really well

2254
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:30,880
developed with some stuff that's sort of

2255
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,880
in the midpoint development use case

2256
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,960
wise and some stuff that's sort of like

2257
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,639
well hey this is really cool now that we

2258
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:38,080
have this we can do these new things

2259
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,440
let's explore

2260
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,800
and

2261
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,480
it seemed like you know and i by the way

2262
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,080
i should say i'm very supportive of the

2263
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:45,120
mock

2264
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,120
stuff so i'm i'm coming from a friendly

2265
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,159
voice here

2266
01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:50,159
i think there's some cases um in

2267
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:53,280
particular i i suggested things like um

2268
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,280
ingest uh median just because we already

2269
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:56,560
have existing

2270
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,360
reliable protocols like srt that have

2271
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,600
said that they're playing with um you

2272
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,320
know going over quick uh and there's

2273
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,320
other you know applications and we've

2274
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,320
seen postings from parties that are

2275
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:11,360
using quick experimentally for ingest

2276
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:13,040
but the use cases for ingest are fairly

2277
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:15,199
well developed so i suggested hey for

2278
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:16,560
the very well-developed stuff maybe

2279
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,199
that's what mock could build a charter

2280
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:22,159
around and expand upon and focus on

2281
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:22,960
um

2282
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,560
and then for other things maybe it's

2283
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,639
time to come back into other groups like

2284
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:28,880
like mops mock mobs

2285
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,760
we name these things badly um

2286
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,239
but come back into mops for discussion

2287
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:36,159
because i think what mops is very good

2288
01:29:36,159 --> 01:29:38,159
at is allowing things to sort of evolve

2289
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:41,520
to a more mature state and then find the

2290
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,760
appropriate home to go to

2291
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,360
um and that was sort of my take on on

2292
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,120
the two things and again very supportive

2293
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:51,559
of of the mock stuff so

2294
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:55,440
what exists today i can help illuminate

2295
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,600
so first off uh my cat's on the mouse

2296
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,840
hopefully it doesn't meet me um

2297
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:02,400
uh i'm actually i work at twitch and

2298
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:06,080
we're pushing uh releasing a quick based

2299
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,639
video delivery protocol

2300
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:11,360
um using web transport

2301
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,760
uh i know facebook is using quick for

2302
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:16,960
ingest already with their player um and

2303
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,840
uh

2304
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,360
in this case we've got two kind of

2305
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,920
production ready implementations and

2306
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,239
then people have been experimenting with

2307
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:25,199
um

2308
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:28,320
rtp over quick and also srt as you

2309
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:32,400
mentioned srt is trying to proxy

2310
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,080
over quick as well so there's a few

2311
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,280
different areas there's a few different

2312
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,040
implementations out there it's really

2313
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,520
too early to tell what works well

2314
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:42,239
um and what maps will as well too quick

2315
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:43,120
um

2316
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:45,040
because sometimes it's it's like you

2317
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,080
mentioned

2318
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,920
the space is pretty well developed and

2319
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:49,360
you need to have a compelling reason to

2320
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,880
use it like not just using the

2321
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:54,159
technology because it exists

2322
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:58,800
i see jonathan's entered the queue

2323
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,800
jonathan

2324
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:08,080
you actually wanted to ask uh uh to luke

2325
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:08,960
because he's mentioned his

2326
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:11,280
implementations what he's found you know

2327
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,440
what he's found so far like you know

2328
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:16,239
what what is quick giving him that you

2329
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:18,880
know existing like say tcp or udp based

2330
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:21,040
things wouldn't do for him

2331
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,360
um in particular is he taking advantage

2332
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:24,880
of some of the

2333
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,560
more complicated reliability and

2334
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,159
ordering

2335
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:29,679
because i think that's sort of where the

2336
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:33,120
interesting things happen for media

2337
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,920
reading more and more over time on the

2338
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:38,560
the mock mailing list um i already i did

2339
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,600
post one thread about uh the problems

2340
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,040
that we've seen

2341
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:46,880
we're an hls based um stack and uh

2342
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,880
with some modifications um but it really

2343
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:51,120
comes down to um headline blocking like

2344
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,400
you're forced to download a single

2345
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,800
segment you're downloading it

2346
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,120
sequentially and when there's congestion

2347
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:58,480
what do you do

2348
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,159
um quick gives you the option to have

2349
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:02,560
things in parallel so kind of uh

2350
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,159
coordinate them together

2351
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:05,840
uh to cancel them better and stuff like

2352
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,840
that um and that's really what we're

2353
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,840
utilizing and we're also in a position

2354
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,600
that we have our own cdn so it's very

2355
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,080
easy to just push data over web

2356
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:16,000
transport but you could totally do this

2357
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,080
with hdb3 as well it's just harder

2358
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,960
so i think um

2359
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,159
i think that we have achieved the

2360
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:28,080
ambition of raising awareness and doing

2361
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,400
some cross-pollination uh between the

2362
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,480
mock effort and mops i think there are

2363
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,080
some suggestions on the table that mops

2364
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,080
might be able to help

2365
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:36,960
um

2366
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,400
base some of the discussions going

2367
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,920
forward in terms of taking some use

2368
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,360
cases but i think that we'll have to see

2369
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:42,320
if that

2370
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,400
transpires on the mailing list

2371
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:45,440
um

2372
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,600
and apart from that i guess

2373
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,280
we would like to see how the mock work

2374
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,880
continues going forward i think that's

2375
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:54,080
about as much we can draw from this

2376
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:58,559
absent a strong proponent in the room

2377
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:02,239
okay

2378
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:05,520
all right

2379
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:06,320
um

2380
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,400
so also keep your eyes peeled from for

2381
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,480
mock yeah keep your eyes peeled for mock

2382
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,239
meetings and upcoming ietf meetings join

2383
01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:15,678
the mailing list get engaged

2384
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:21,480
all right kyle go for it

2385
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,159
all right so can everybody see the

2386
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:28,638
slides

2387
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,719
i'll assume that's yes

2388
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:35,120
so uh this is the the mops two-year

2389
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:36,719
retrospective can you believe it's been

2390
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:38,400
slightly over two years since the

2391
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,639
working group was formed um you can

2392
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:42,159
almost smell the benzene of the

2393
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:45,120
retrospecticus

2394
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,120
that's a simpson's reference if nobody

2395
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,679
gets it anyway so

2396
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:52,000
i'm i'm afraid that the that the first

2397
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,600
part of this deck is going to be a bit

2398
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,000
of a downer but you know it gets better

2399
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,960
i promise so uh so here's how it started

2400
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:00,320
um

2401
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,639
basically two years ago well up until

2402
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:04,000
two years ago there were some side

2403
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,320
meetings the the ggie meetings and then

2404
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:07,840
the video interest group side meetings

2405
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,239
that went on for for several years

2406
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:14,960
um in montreal in 2019 uh is when we had

2407
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,400
the mops buff

2408
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:19,280
where we got you know we essentially had

2409
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,440
a discussion about about whether it was

2410
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,280
uh reasonable to make a working group

2411
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:24,480
and what the scope of the charter would

2412
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,480
be and what not and so finally in

2413
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:29,040
november it was formed just before the

2414
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:30,800
singapore ietf

2415
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:33,679
um and so we had our first in-person

2416
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:36,719
session at uh in singapore

2417
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:39,840
uh and then in march the uh the

2418
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,840
vancouver meeting was cancelled

2419
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:44,960
and so here's how it's going now

2420
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:48,719
um note the the the highlighted virtuals

2421
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:50,320
there

2422
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,159
which is kind of uh

2423
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:53,840
it's

2424
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:56,080
so i think it's been it's been

2425
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:59,040
kind of a downer for a lot of working

2426
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,280
groups but i think it's especially been

2427
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:04,320
a it it's been a special challenge for

2428
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,960
for mops because of the nature of a lot

2429
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,719
of the work that we do

2430
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:09,840
right so

2431
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,280
um i just

2432
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,960
took a screenshot of the milestones

2433
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:16,560
quickly there's a you know like we we've

2434
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:19,280
this is this was a snapshot that i took

2435
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:21,360
earlier this week and i know that we've

2436
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:24,239
bumped some of these dates up or back i

2437
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:26,960
guess um several times

2438
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:29,600
as we have kind of missed milestones we

2439
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:31,040
have you know obviously we have a few

2440
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,080
done

2441
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,760
but we still have a lot of work that we

2442
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,280
intended to do at the beginning that is

2443
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:36,880
not done yet

2444
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,800
um

2445
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,159
these are the two documents we've

2446
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:42,880
adopted it seems you know it seems a

2447
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,800
little meager but you know on the other

2448
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,960
hand that you know publishing documents

2449
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,440
was not the main purpose of mobs to

2450
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,600
begin with it never was

2451
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,560
um what is our main purpose well

2452
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,480
if you look at

2453
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,000
um

2454
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,600
damn the uh

2455
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,840
this is in the wrong place in the slide

2456
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,239
all right anyway there's some

2457
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:07,600
we i'll come back to the slide

2458
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,080
so if you look at our charter right i've

2459
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,719
highlighted kind of the the verbs the

2460
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:14,960
actions that that mops was chartered to

2461
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:16,000
take on

2462
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,360
uh solicit regular updates solicit input

2463
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:22,400
uh solicit discussion and documentation

2464
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,080
there are a number of things here and

2465
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:27,040
many of them are rendezvous functions

2466
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:29,520
right they are functions of getting

2467
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,440
people in the same room together to

2468
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:34,000
discuss common sets of problems and come

2469
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,480
up with either you know classes of

2470
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:39,040
solutions or direct you know figure out

2471
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,480
where there are gaps in existing

2472
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,880
standards and direct work to to other

2473
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:45,920
working groups within the itf and uh and

2474
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:47,920
outside sdos

2475
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:49,760
and so without those

2476
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,480
without those hallway conversations

2477
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,480
without the you know like the you know

2478
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:55,679
having a bunch of people in the

2479
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:57,679
hackathon room like working on the same

2480
01:36:57,679 --> 01:37:01,600
thing or doing demos um without a lot of

2481
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,159
tourists coming to mops because you know

2482
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:05,679
because they just they're they happen to

2483
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:06,800
have a free slot and they're like all

2484
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,400
right let me go you know go into this

2485
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:10,960
room it looks interesting um

2486
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:12,480
without the you know a lot of the

2487
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:15,040
cross-pollination of having everyone in

2488
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:17,600
the same physical space talking about

2489
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:20,080
problems and seeing where there are

2490
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:21,840
where there's overlap and where there

2491
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,920
are you know potential synergies between

2492
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:26,960
work and seeing the the reduction in new

2493
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:29,440
work overall i mean that's been a real

2494
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:32,400
drag from virtual meetings and i think

2495
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,560
it's it's impacted mops more than a lot

2496
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:36,480
of other working groups which had

2497
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,480
which had explicit

2498
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,600
um work items in progress and moving but

2499
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,760
it probably has also impacted working

2500
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:44,960
groups that

2501
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,960
uh that have been trying to find new

2502
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:49,280
work as well i'm sure it differs from

2503
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,199
group to group but it's just this is

2504
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:53,280
just has been my observation based on

2505
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,920
talking to other people so

2506
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:59,920
um that having been said we've uh

2507
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:02,400
we've solicited a bunch of presentations

2508
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:04,480
we've had a bunch of interesting talks

2509
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:07,040
will law talked a few meetings ago

2510
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:08,320
um

2511
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:09,840
new participants have come to us they've

2512
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:12,239
actually sought out mops talked to us

2513
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:14,320
and we've hooked them up with people in

2514
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:15,760
in the working group and have them come

2515
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,840
in and give give presentations

2516
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,520
and moreover there have been a lot of

2517
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,360
intangibles that mobs have provided

2518
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:24,000
right we're responsible for a bunch of

2519
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,199
conversations happening even though

2520
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:26,560
they're not having it happening in a

2521
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,400
physical hallway they're happening on

2522
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,800
the internet in virtual hallways

2523
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:33,280
um and so like i think that a lot of

2524
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:36,159
that things like things like uh like

2525
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:39,040
mock things like uh the the renaissance

2526
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,400
multicast

2527
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:43,520
uh work on reducing latency are all

2528
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:46,400
things that mops has assisted in in

2529
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,600
helping get more attention uh paid to

2530
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:53,280
these things um and uh assisted in

2531
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:55,040
bootstrapping some of this work and so i

2532
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:57,600
think that's that's you know that's a

2533
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,920
lot of what we've done now going back to

2534
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:02,159
to the earlier slide uh some other

2535
01:39:02,159 --> 01:39:04,719
things that we've done um

2536
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:07,199
that that mops has done in addition to

2537
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:09,520
the you know in addition to kind of the

2538
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,600
the uh the work internal to the working

2539
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,360
group is providing external community

2540
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:14,880
engagement right so

2541
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:18,880
uh the smt smpte updates sympty updates

2542
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:21,199
uh streaming video alliance updates

2543
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:25,280
um we have a paper that we submitted to

2544
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:26,480
simpty

2545
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,159
earlier this year

2546
01:39:28,159 --> 01:39:30,400
that we're going to be presenting on in

2547
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,800
uh i think it's in december

2548
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,440
uh but don't quote me on that um so

2549
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:36,239
there's

2550
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:37,760
there's a bunch of stuff that we've done

2551
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,920
and i'm you know i'm pleased with how

2552
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:41,600
the with how the working group has been

2553
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,199
has been going

2554
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:44,880
but i mean there are questions about how

2555
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:48,320
we can increase um the efficacy of the

2556
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:50,639
working group like what can we do to

2557
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:52,800
make ourselves more effective

2558
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:54,639
right i mean meeting in person yeah that

2559
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:56,480
would be great that would

2560
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,239
you know solve a lot of the problems

2561
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:00,560
that you know or or at least eliminate

2562
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,159
many of the challenges that we see today

2563
01:40:02,159 --> 01:40:03,199
but

2564
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:05,119
unfortunately that's not actionable

2565
01:40:05,119 --> 01:40:06,560
we're either going to have an in-person

2566
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,639
meeting or we're not and we don't have

2567
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:10,960
any control over that that's going to be

2568
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:14,080
a you know that's a kind of a shared uh

2569
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:17,119
decision uh among all the itf

2570
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:18,560
participants

2571
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,719
do we just carry on as is are things

2572
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:22,639
going well enough that we think that

2573
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:24,159
we're you know that we're on the right

2574
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:26,480
track um you know we should just make

2575
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,600
incremental changes from here on in um

2576
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,280
do we broaden draft scope or we talked

2577
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:33,440
before about uh looking at the augmented

2578
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:36,239
reality draft and saying well maybe this

2579
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:38,960
is maybe the the use case is much more

2580
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,960
specific than the problems described so

2581
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:42,400
maybe we ought to broaden the scope

2582
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,480
there it's another option

2583
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,679
um

2584
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:47,360
some things that we probably should do

2585
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:48,719
is figure out how to unblock some of the

2586
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:50,400
unmet milestones right i mean we have

2587
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:53,280
milestones that we added to the data

2588
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,760
tracker back at the very beginning and

2589
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,199
they haven't you know some of them

2590
01:40:57,199 --> 01:40:58,480
haven't been finished yet right so what

2591
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,639
can we do to get those moving along

2592
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:02,719
um

2593
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:04,159
should we solicit feedback from

2594
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:05,840
non-participants are there people who

2595
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:07,360
have you know thought about

2596
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:10,639
participating in mops uh and decided not

2597
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:12,719
to or are there people who don't know

2598
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:15,040
about mops and maybe we ought to figure

2599
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,119
out maybe why they don't why they don't

2600
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:18,400
know about it

2601
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,719
um should we coordinate with in-progress

2602
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:23,679
standards activity uh going on elsewhere

2603
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:27,040
in in the ietf right so uh

2604
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,679
so uh we could have uh we could do

2605
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:31,280
something experimental like designate

2606
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:33,199
point participants for interaction with

2607
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:34,960
other with other working groups both

2608
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,639
within the ietf and other standards

2609
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:38,880
organizations and get

2610
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:41,760
you know either written reports or or

2611
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:44,400
just you know presentations at meetings

2612
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,880
uh so that we can kind of

2613
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,199
spread information about these things in

2614
01:41:49,199 --> 01:41:50,960
a more efficient manner

2615
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:53,679
um having some forecasts

2616
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:56,159
about where we think the industry is

2617
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:57,119
going

2618
01:41:57,119 --> 01:42:00,000
so we can foresee what what areas of

2619
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,719
work might need doing and then kind of

2620
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:05,199
bring that information to relevant uh

2621
01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:07,199
working groups that's another that's

2622
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:09,360
another uh option

2623
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:10,239
um

2624
01:42:10,239 --> 01:42:12,960
do we have uh do we wanna have some sort

2625
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:15,040
of vision or road map for itf

2626
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,600
contributions to the media ecosystem

2627
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,320
right so the media ecosystem is vast and

2628
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,960
confusing ietf participants may only see

2629
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:25,199
a small part of it and not understand

2630
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:27,679
how it fits into sort of the the larger

2631
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:30,320
media ecosystem and so maybe we could

2632
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:32,320
develop some problem statements for

2633
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,639
internet media operations to clarify

2634
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:36,719
some of the challenges that we're seeing

2635
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:39,119
um and maybe to use the the challenges

2636
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:41,600
to then suggest uh directions for future

2637
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:42,639
work

2638
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:46,080
um and finally uh you know uh

2639
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:47,440
should we solicit input from other

2640
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:49,280
working groups facing similar challenges

2641
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:51,920
right i i think one of the things i

2642
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:56,159
don't have a good a good beat on is to

2643
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:58,080
what extent other working groups are

2644
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:00,719
seeing engagement challenges

2645
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:03,360
uh resulting from the lack of in-person

2646
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:05,440
meetings and i'd you know and and

2647
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,360
whether you know if some other working

2648
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:10,080
groups have seen similar challenges what

2649
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,280
have they done

2650
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:14,080
uh over the past you know 20 months to

2651
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,600
to uh

2652
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:18,159
to help work on those

2653
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:21,360
so uh now i'm going to throw it open to

2654
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:24,960
to the floor for thoughts suggestions

2655
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,960
um looks like glenn wants to make some

2656
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:29,440
comments yeah and probably to peddle

2657
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:31,199
some of the crap that i've just said

2658
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:33,360
before we get there uh before we get

2659
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:36,400
there i think um

2660
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:39,600
we should ask eric to give an update on

2661
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:43,920
the iesg review of the working group

2662
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:48,400
since that was one of our milestones

2663
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:51,119
to request uh

2664
01:43:51,119 --> 01:43:53,360
speaking so thank you for inviting me

2665
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:56,719
before i actually request

2666
01:43:56,719 --> 01:43:59,040
indeed so you know the mops is a kind of

2667
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,480
a

2668
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,880
time bomb attached to it right we need

2669
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:05,600
to kind of renew the working group

2670
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:06,960
for me

2671
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,760
uh it's okay it's doing uh i was really

2672
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:11,920
concerned the beginning of this meeting

2673
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:13,360
right when i saw

2674
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:17,119
at the top of the hour only 11 people

2675
01:44:17,119 --> 01:44:18,880
attending the meeting it was kind of

2676
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:20,400
scary because

2677
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,719
mobs is basically to

2678
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:24,560
attract people sharing the same common

2679
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:27,199
interests right so now we we peak at 40

2680
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:30,239
we are 33 so

2681
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:33,119
that's okay i think uh i've also heard a

2682
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:35,360
very interesting discussion in the last

2683
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:38,239
two hours or an hour and a half

2684
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:40,560
so i'm pretty satisfied i know that

2685
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:44,159
warren which is kind of the ops um

2686
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:46,320
area director right so i'm interior

2687
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:49,840
director but not using uh in synopse

2688
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,760
is also happy with the

2689
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:53,440
functioning and

2690
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:56,080
how mops works he's unable to join today

2691
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:58,080
because i guess it's a dns office at the

2692
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:00,400
same time it is of course more important

2693
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:03,280
for him than mobs

2694
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:04,400
the

2695
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:07,840
issue of other working group

2696
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,280
with these

2697
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:11,760
not in person meetings is everywhere

2698
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:12,639
right

2699
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:14,320
it's more critical here like you said

2700
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:16,800
guy because it was really

2701
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,800
met uh mean

2702
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,000
as a

2703
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,600
place to gather people with the shared

2704
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:24,400
interest but the lack of work

2705
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,239
is eating mostly everywhere specifically

2706
01:45:26,239 --> 01:45:27,920
the lack of new work

2707
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:30,719
so we have a measure at the isg about

2708
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:33,440
the number of dash zero zero draft

2709
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:36,639
and this one is lower than two years ago

2710
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:38,719
for all the working groups

2711
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:41,360
uh we don't do it per area so maybe some

2712
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:42,800
areas are more

2713
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,480
uh impacted than others but it's

2714
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:45,600
everywhere

2715
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:49,440
okay and as leslie we talked also before

2716
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:52,320
when god and myself and and lastly we

2717
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:54,719
were preparing this meeting

2718
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:55,520
that

2719
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:58,159
you think i had no time to investigate

2720
01:45:58,159 --> 01:46:00,639
further but you think that

2721
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:03,360
the new zero zero uh

2722
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:07,199
only coming from very interested parties

2723
01:46:07,199 --> 01:46:10,639
right so with a kind of a lot of

2724
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:13,600
small party trying to do new work

2725
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,920
um

2726
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:18,880
so for me i'm pretty fine uh we already

2727
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:21,199
discussed the mops at the previous iesg

2728
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:22,159
meeting

2729
01:46:22,159 --> 01:46:24,320
uh and it was continuing right so

2730
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,480
everyone says okay go on

2731
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:29,360
and i remember what i said last time iot

2732
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:30,480
ops

2733
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:32,000
is very similar

2734
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,719
to mobs right and more and more when you

2735
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:37,199
do both for creating new work including

2736
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:39,840
sometimes say oh is it ala

2737
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:42,480
right uh is it a mobs like

2738
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:43,520
so

2739
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:46,400
mobs now is a an adjective somehow right

2740
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:50,159
uh in the isg slang so for me yes it is

2741
01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:53,320
it's okay

2742
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,800
it's a good job and good job summary uh

2743
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:59,440
kind by the way

2744
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:01,440
thanks eric and just to close the loop

2745
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:03,840
my understanding is that the uh

2746
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:06,400
we were reviewed after two years and we

2747
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:10,559
are not dead yet so um

2748
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:15,280
just to be clear

2749
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,320
yeah two years it's maybe it's basically

2750
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:19,840
you know right there is a debrief of the

2751
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:21,679
isg and the iab

2752
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:22,880
next week

2753
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:23,679
uh

2754
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:25,840
i will talk about mobs there and say yes

2755
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:28,719
it's two years it's extended one year

2756
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:31,040
okay thank you

2757
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,360
everybody

2758
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:36,300
sort of damocles is still there

2759
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:38,159
[Laughter]

2760
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:40,400
ben

2761
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,119
i was wrong in that i don't want to

2762
01:47:45,119 --> 01:47:46,320
correct anything he said i thought you

2763
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,800
did it really well thanks kyle um for

2764
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:50,880
running through that i i just want to

2765
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,159
add you know i've been a long-time

2766
01:47:52,159 --> 01:47:54,480
proponent for mops you know going way

2767
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:55,520
back

2768
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,600
and and you know i think we've done a

2769
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:59,600
lot of good stuff um

2770
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,159
you know the core problem that was a lot

2771
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:04,800
of my motivation in the past is that we

2772
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,639
have

2773
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:09,280
the number one use the internet by you

2774
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:12,000
know data and scaling and deriving to

2775
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,400
add those bigger pipes is video

2776
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,400
and we've always had a sort of a

2777
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:19,360
historic slight disconnect with

2778
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:21,840
the representation of voices trying to

2779
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:23,280
do video stuff

2780
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:25,760
when we talked about things at the itf

2781
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:28,000
and being a video guy that was always a

2782
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,119
thing well we need to fix this and

2783
01:48:31,119 --> 01:48:32,800
you know

2784
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,320
the reason why

2785
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:35,920
other groups of the itf you know are

2786
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:37,360
very active i think you produce a lot of

2787
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:39,119
zero zero drafts as eric points out is

2788
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:41,199
that we have a real established

2789
01:48:41,199 --> 01:48:42,560
community especially if you look at

2790
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:44,800
transport i mean transport's been core

2791
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:47,119
at the itf for how long and and and

2792
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:49,440
things like dns has been core at the itm

2793
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,520
this is the home where those people come

2794
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:53,040
and they talk they have a community

2795
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:55,520
established um you know we have a number

2796
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:56,320
of

2797
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:58,320
parties from different organizations

2798
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:59,600
that all know each other have known each

2799
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:01,360
other for decades that come together and

2800
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:02,960
work on problems

2801
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:04,800
and i think that we're sort of the early

2802
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:07,600
days of reaching that gap between the

2803
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:10,480
itf and these video guys out there which

2804
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:12,480
are producing all these documents

2805
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:15,040
but i'm seeing a very positive you know

2806
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:17,040
developments you know i'm seeing that we

2807
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,000
have

2808
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,520
um you know

2809
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:21,520
when places like cd and i needed working

2810
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:24,159
group chairs you know sanjay was around

2811
01:49:24,159 --> 01:49:26,800
uh to step up and become a co-chair of

2812
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:29,520
cdni uh which connects to like you know

2813
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:31,119
the real world and the real delivery

2814
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:32,560
folks versus just people developing

2815
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:36,159
technology uh you know and we have other

2816
01:49:36,159 --> 01:49:37,360
things that are being discussed and

2817
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:38,639
thrown around

2818
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:41,119
that is creating a welcoming home for

2819
01:49:41,119 --> 01:49:42,480
the people from that video world that

2820
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:43,840
are doing all these video things on the

2821
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:45,679
internet and driving all the traffic and

2822
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:47,760
all the scalability to come into the itf

2823
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,920
and have conversations and i think that

2824
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:52,639
mobs has shown through the parties that

2825
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:54,159
are coming here and i believe the

2826
01:49:54,159 --> 01:49:56,639
parties that will still come um that you

2827
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:57,920
know when people ask the question you

2828
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:00,000
know i come from a video world i i need

2829
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,679
to engage with the itf i believe i want

2830
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:03,920
to engage back to you how do i do that

2831
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:06,400
but that now that box exists it's the

2832
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:07,599
place to say well you can talk to the

2833
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:09,199
box guys first they may not be the right

2834
01:50:09,199 --> 01:50:10,480
final destination

2835
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,639
but they're the right first destination

2836
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:15,119
and they can you know help you bring in

2837
01:50:15,119 --> 01:50:16,719
they can be a friendly voice a friendly

2838
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:18,080
a friend face

2839
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:19,840
and help things mature to a point where

2840
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,199
they're ready then connect with other

2841
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:22,639
itf working groups

2842
01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:24,719
and build that bigger community so it's

2843
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:26,880
early days but i see that community

2844
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:29,199
developing nicely and and i'm very

2845
01:50:29,199 --> 01:50:31,360
helpful hopeful that we're going to see

2846
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:33,440
you know this continue on and and and

2847
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:35,040
the relationships

2848
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,880
grow and so that you know 10 years now

2849
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:38,960
we're gonna have this whole room full of

2850
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:41,119
you know itf video people that have

2851
01:50:41,119 --> 01:50:43,119
known each other for 10 years and when

2852
01:50:43,119 --> 01:50:44,639
there's a new problem a new thing to

2853
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:47,040
work on this is where they come to do it

2854
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,040
so that's just my two cents i want to

2855
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:52,280
throw in

2856
01:50:54,239 --> 01:50:56,239
all right thanks glenn

2857
01:50:56,239 --> 01:50:59,638
uh sanjay

2858
01:51:10,159 --> 01:51:13,360
sanjay did you want to go ahead

2859
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:16,080
yeah yeah i i just wanted to uh echo

2860
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:18,880
what uh glenn just said uh so well i

2861
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:21,840
think there's a lot of issues that

2862
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,920
are not necessarily

2863
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:25,760
well defined in terms of that you know i

2864
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:28,080
know i know i need some work on

2865
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,840
protocols so i i

2866
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:32,560
itf working groups are the right place

2867
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:35,760
there are many cases operationally where

2868
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:38,880
um mob seems like a good you know first

2869
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:41,119
place to start and bring the question

2870
01:51:41,119 --> 01:51:42,080
that

2871
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:44,080
that may not be you know

2872
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:46,080
wanting to change the protocol but maybe

2873
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:46,960
you know

2874
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:47,760
the

2875
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:49,280
making sure that you understand it and

2876
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:52,719
you implement it right so some of those

2877
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:55,280
types of areas really fit well within

2878
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:57,280
you know what this working group can

2879
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,040
offer so

2880
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:01,840
i think there's a great deal of value

2881
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,440
and

2882
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:05,040
obviously the

2883
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:06,400
as um

2884
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,920
kyle was saying that you know we don't

2885
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,080
have the luxury right now of meeting in

2886
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:11,760
person so a lot of those hallway

2887
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:13,280
conversations

2888
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:15,280
that may happen and that may lead to

2889
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:17,760
people that are attending a specific you

2890
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:19,520
know working group but they may show up

2891
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:20,880
here because

2892
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:22,639
oh yeah that's really an operational

2893
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:24,400
issue that at least we should bring it

2894
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:26,800
back into the mob's working group so we

2895
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:28,480
we kind of don't have that

2896
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:31,599
uh right now but regardless of that i

2897
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:33,840
think this is a good venue where

2898
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:34,800
um

2899
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:37,199
i know sva can benefit a lot you know

2900
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:38,639
streaming video alliance there are a lot

2901
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:40,320
of different operational issues and best

2902
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,080
practices that they are dealing with

2903
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:44,080
some of which might actually lead to

2904
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:46,880
some work in in the um

2905
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:48,080
within the different working groups

2906
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:49,760
within ietf but

2907
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,679
at least mops is one place where we can

2908
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:53,679
we think we can bring some of the

2909
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:56,679
discussions

2910
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:02,000
great

2911
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,679
thank you sanjay

2912
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:05,920
yeah yeah i agree and i i think it's i

2913
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:07,840
think it's clear that it's it's been

2914
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:11,520
useful to a lot of folks so i'm uh

2915
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:14,800
i'm optimistic um and i'm definitely

2916
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,320
supportive of continuing the working

2917
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:18,559
group

2918
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:21,040
um

2919
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:22,960
from the chair standpoint i think the

2920
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:24,719
only thing that's really troubling me in

2921
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:26,800
all of this is how quiet the mailing

2922
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:29,199
list is and as i alluded to earlier the

2923
01:53:29,199 --> 01:53:30,159
sort of

2924
01:53:30,159 --> 01:53:31,920
bifurcation between the people who come

2925
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:34,080
to meetings and the discussion that

2926
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:36,000
doesn't happen on the mailing list and i

2927
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,080
don't entirely know how to address that

2928
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:40,000
i mean i think the reality is a lot of

2929
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,880
mailing lists have gotten quiet and just

2930
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:45,440
because mail is so last century

2931
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:47,520
um and

2932
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:48,800
um

2933
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,239
it isn't helped by the fact that we

2934
01:53:50,239 --> 01:53:51,840
don't have the sort of vibrant

2935
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,679
people know each other community thing

2936
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:56,480
going on but i'm i'm saying it here in

2937
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,480
my out loud voice just because i think

2938
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:00,239
it is an area that we're going to have

2939
01:54:00,239 --> 01:54:02,320
to find answers to

2940
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:03,119
um

2941
01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:05,760
if we want to successfully progress

2942
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:07,360
through discussions of

2943
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:09,760
topics and documents and last calls and

2944
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:10,880
whatnot

2945
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:13,520
um as as we go along

2946
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:15,920
glenn are you wanting to say more or are

2947
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:17,040
you just

2948
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:20,000
lounging in queue

2949
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:23,599
scared him out of cue

2950
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:27,040
nope

2951
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:30,159
i'm not the microphone

2952
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:34,320
luke

2953
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:37,760
say from my personal experience i

2954
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:40,560
haven't known when to interact with this

2955
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:43,119
working group like even just a little

2956
01:54:43,119 --> 01:54:45,440
blurb about media over quick earlier i i

2957
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:48,239
wasn't sure if it's appropriate to like

2958
01:54:48,239 --> 01:54:49,679
say what i've been working on in this

2959
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:51,280
working group or if i should just go

2960
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:53,599
straight to like a more specific one

2961
01:54:53,599 --> 01:54:55,599
like media over quick so it kind of

2962
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:56,639
means

2963
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:58,159
at least in my mind i

2964
01:54:58,159 --> 01:55:00,560
discussions are

2965
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,800
either scoped correctly already uh or

2966
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:07,360
end up in like the catch-all and mops

2967
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,800
right well and i think it's it's a good

2968
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:13,199
question and and maybe partly because

2969
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:14,800
even if you review the history of

2970
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,560
discussions on the on the mailing list

2971
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:17,679
you're not going to see a lot of

2972
01:55:17,679 --> 01:55:20,000
exemplars but i mean

2973
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,440
i would say at this point the mailing

2974
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:23,440
list is going to be what we make it

2975
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:24,880
um and

2976
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:27,199
speaking of this one one chair i would

2977
01:55:27,199 --> 01:55:28,960
rather see more discussion there more

2978
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:31,199
ideas tossed out there than fewer

2979
01:55:31,199 --> 01:55:32,560
so

2980
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:33,760
certainly

2981
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:36,719
please don't feel shy

2982
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:42,480
yeah if something's off topic we'll

2983
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:44,000
we'll let you know

2984
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,960
kindly and gently like

2985
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:48,719
in this specific example i can talk

2986
01:55:48,719 --> 01:55:51,280
about media over quick and it's fine

2987
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:52,800
even if there is already another mailing

2988
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:54,639
list for it

2989
01:55:54,639 --> 01:55:56,239
yeah i think that's a particular area

2990
01:55:56,239 --> 01:55:57,920
where you know

2991
01:55:57,920 --> 01:55:59,599
the ietf is trying to figure out what

2992
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:01,760
it's doing so uh i wouldn't want to get

2993
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:03,840
in the way of an organized activity of

2994
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:05,440
media over quick but if there are things

2995
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:06,239
that

2996
01:56:06,239 --> 01:56:08,239
we can do to help in discussion we'd be

2997

3004
01:56:39,119 --> 01:56:40,159
uh

3005
01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:43,760
oh jake

3006
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:46,239
one last uh not not complaint i think

3007
01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:50,000
you guys are doing great uh but uh

3008
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,080
regarding the mailing list being last

3009
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:54,239
century it made me wonder there is a

3010
01:56:54,239 --> 01:56:58,960
ietf slack uh room should we

3011
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:01,760
i'm not sure it'll be any better but uh

3012
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:03,199
and it's

3013
01:57:03,199 --> 01:57:05,040
i'm in a couple of rooms there i think

3014
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:06,639
it's usually pretty quiet but i'm not

3015
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:08,159
sure if

3016
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:10,159
uh if anybody would prefer that and i

3017
01:57:10,159 --> 01:57:14,000
thought i'd just ask um instead of

3018
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,440
leaving it in chat or i think you got

3019
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:17,119
missed yeah that's

3020
01:57:17,119 --> 01:57:18,639
that's a good question and i would

3021
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:20,480
suggest if you don't mind dropping it in

3022
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:22,800
the notes that would be great too

3023
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:25,840
um i think that

3024
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:27,520
we may want to do that

3025
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:29,199
we're still going to wind up with the

3026
01:57:29,199 --> 01:57:31,119
same question we had about the working

3027
01:57:31,119 --> 01:57:32,719
group last call which is if it doesn't

3028
01:57:32,719 --> 01:57:34,159
happen on the mailing list it didn't

3029
01:57:34,159 --> 01:57:35,119
happen

3030
01:57:35,119 --> 01:57:38,719
um so it maybe we need a slack channel

3031
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:39,599
and

3032
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:43,360
more comments on the mailing list

3033
01:57:46,159 --> 01:57:48,000
one observation i wonder if part of you

3034
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,159
know part of the the work we're doing

3035
01:57:50,159 --> 01:57:51,920
here is to bridge in culturally these

3036
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:54,159
folks that aren't traditionally itf

3037
01:57:54,159 --> 01:57:56,560
people but coming from the video world

3038
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:58,000
and i'm wondering if

3039
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:01,440
we need to help uh them uh adapt to

3040
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:03,440
what's appropriate on the itf family

3041
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:06,159
lists you know if i'm new to an area i i

3042
01:58:06,159 --> 01:58:07,440
probably want to adapt whatever the

3043
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:09,040
local culture is

3044
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:11,360
and since we're fairly low volume and

3045
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:13,920
fairly new uh we don't have necessarily

3046
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:15,599
like a demonstratable culture that they

3047
01:58:15,599 --> 01:58:18,239
can plug right into and i'm not sure how

3048
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:20,719
to solve it other than say you know

3049
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:23,119
we're very welcoming and please post uh

3050
01:58:23,119 --> 01:58:24,800
maybe those of us who are here already

3051
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:26,239
just need to take it upon ourselves to

3052
01:58:26,239 --> 01:58:28,639
be a little more chatty on the list

3053
01:58:28,639 --> 01:58:30,880
um to demonstrate sort of a culture of

3054
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:34,599
openness and engagement

3055
01:58:37,199 --> 01:58:39,440
yep

3056
01:58:40,239 --> 01:58:43,598
that's a good suggestion thanks

3057
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,639
all right well uh unless anybody has any

3058
01:58:46,639 --> 01:58:48,800
