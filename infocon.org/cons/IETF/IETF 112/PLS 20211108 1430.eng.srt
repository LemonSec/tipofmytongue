107
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,280
room for questions

108
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,919

[Music]

150
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,600
and my understanding is uh the other

151
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,560
draft is waiting on uh some action from

152
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,720
uh the shepherd maybe loa

153
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,840

but it's

158
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,800
probably an error from me

159
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,160
okay i mean this is the chance for the

160
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
authors to comment if they think uh

161
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,840
otherwise uh

162
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,080
so feel free i i'm not monitoring the

163

168
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,479
with some questions

169
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,240
and right now

170
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,759
the ad is waiting on the authors to

171
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,080

193
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,840
allocation

with any open issues and the next

201
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,159
plan to take uh to take on them

202
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,839
yeah i got that notification so

203
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,600
uh yeah whoever

204
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,080
pavan go ahead

205
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,360
um

206
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,800
regarding rar cpfr

207
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,080
i i mean this was uh i mean it was

208
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,160
pushed to isg for application i think it

209
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,080
just sat there for some time

210
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,480
and i think the ask was to uh make

211
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,279
enough i mean the updates are made but

212
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,880
the ask was to go back to the working

213
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,160
group and

214
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,360
revisit it i don't know why it's stuck

215
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,120
in the state is there something that's

216
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,160
expected of the authors

217
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,080
yeah it came back from the working group

218
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,880
actually it was sent back from

219
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,560
um

220
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,440
the the ad or the the attitude queue

221
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,920
back to the working group for taking

222
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,680
action

223
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,480
and

224
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,320
as far as i know

225
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,680
um

226
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,839
has the action been taken uh

227
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,600
yeah my understanding is that i mean i

228
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,399
think the problem there was that the

229
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,240
requested edits were made but the

230
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,880
authors took a while to get that

231
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,000
done

232
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,279
because

233
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,240
of the delay uh the ask was to go back

234
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,720
to the working group and come back i

235
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,519
mean

236
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,200
that's how i interpreted that there are

237
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,800
no updates to be made

238
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,279
so i mean i i think it can progress

239
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,720
again that's my take on it

240
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,279
okay so maybe an email saying that all

241
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,120
the action or all the outstanding

242
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,040
comments have been uh

243
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,160
cleared

244
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,360
make sense

245
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,959
we'll do that

246
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,399
though why do you want to add more on

247
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,160
this

248
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,200
uh

249
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,399

um so sfo control i've done as much as i

269
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,279
can do without some feedback from other

270
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,240
people so either informal feedback by

271
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,920
someone by people in the working group

272
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,279
reading it or formal feedback by the

273
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,839
working group chairs putting it through

274
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,079

275
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,399

276
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,399

stuart is right

283
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,519

uh yes please i mean i just say i i

285

feedback which we can do which i'll

287

the agenda from the individual drafts

356
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,199
okay uh

357
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,480
i promised the report on this draft

358
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,279
in band pm encapsulation so

359
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,839
there was a version that was reviewed by

360
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,079
the mpls review team

361
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,079
version one and

362
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,320
the authors took action and addressed

363
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,920
all the comments

364
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,040
version 2 stands as is there's an open

365
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
issue

366
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
or maybe it's

367
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,120
staying in line with what is happening

368
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,440
in the mpls open design team

369
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,399
um

370
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,240
there is a talk

371
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,160
about mpls indicators and ancillary data

372
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,079
uh being uh you know

373
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,920
being discussed at open design team so

374
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,600
this will allow

375
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,360
a single spl uh to carry uh multiple

376
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,399
actions

377
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,560
and the authors they think that this is

378
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,600
related this this can be an action

379
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,519
that

380
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,399
that the miad indicator can carry

381
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,440
so

382
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,360
i encourage you know that the authors of

383
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,519
this draft personally i encourage them

384
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,839
to uh participate in the open design

385
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,680
team and highlight that this is a

386
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,839
an action or a function

387
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,800
that can be uh also

388
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,839
part of the discussions

389
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,560
this is your chance the office if you

390
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,720
want to comment more

391
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,920
but this is my feedback

392
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,639
okay

393
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,160
i see kiriti is in the queue

394
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,959
do you want to go ahead greedy

395
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,279
yeah can you hear me

396
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,759
yes i can

397
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,639
okay

398
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,040
my question was for

399
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,160
i'm hearing an echo

400
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,360
that might be just me

401
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,680
um

402
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,240
your voice is a little bit faint can you

403
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,359
raise up your voice a bit

404
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,959
is this better

405
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,559
a little bit but still

406
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,439
can you do any better

407
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:16,079
[Music]

408
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,959
okay um

409
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,760
the the question was for the lr draft um

410
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,599
you know we wanted to make it a working

411
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,959
group document

412
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:25,679
so

413
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,120
where are we in that process

414
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,240
yeah uh the last time we met kiriti on

415
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,440
this uh

416
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,640
there was a action on the office to uh

417
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,160
you know at least uh indicate that

418
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,240
uh was there an action

419
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,679
on the lr

420
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,700
to

421
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,240
[Music]

422
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,080
integrate this with what's happening in

423
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,559
mpls open design team uh is that

424
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,919
accurate last time we took this note

425
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,120
or maybe i'm missing something

426
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,039
i missed the question is there an action

427
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,880
yeah i think there was you know an

428
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,799
update uh that

429
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,440
you promised to make to the draft

430
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,280
the larp

431
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,080
uh i would check with my co-author

432
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,720
um unfortunately he just left juniper

433
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,200
but um i will check with him

434
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,120
but from what i understood it was just

435
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,720
to make it a

436
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
working group document

437
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,200
but i'll check with him okay oh okay

438
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,520
okay

439
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,720
okay

440
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,679
uh kiriti or nick do you uh have

441
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,160
anything to add on this uh the lr draft

442
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,679
not right now

443
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,520
oh no

444
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,640
nick

445
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,360
no no no

446
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,120
no i think it's fine

447
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,720
okay

448
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,880
thank you

449
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,000
uh move on and hand over now to uh loa

450
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,679
to talk a little bit about

451
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,799
the uh

452
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,720
report on mpls open design team

453
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,559
activities

454
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,240
okay uh

455
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,120
i tried to do this rather quickly

456
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,919
we normally have done one short report

457
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,080
here and another report in the design

458
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,880
team

459
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,440
this time it won't be a report in the

460
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,960
design thing so this is what you get

461
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,039
when i think back to the start of the

462
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,080
work

463
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,600
um

464
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,280
it seemed to be

465
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
just a small piece

466
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,559
we needed to

467
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,640
do something about

468
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,160
organizing the use of

469
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,440
the first

470
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,280
bytes of the the uh the boss

471
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,080
but

472
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,160
when looking at it it's kind of

473
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,720
it's growing and growing and we're

474
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,919
starting to get close to taking decision

475
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,480
on some of the issues so watch out next

476
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,039
slide please

477
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,480
uh so

478
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,720
we had quite suddenly

479
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,360
uh five or six drives that actually was

480
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,559
looking to using the same

481
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,799
place in the labor stack as we had been

482
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,880
using for the ach and it

483
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,600
turned out that it wouldn't work so we

484
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,760
needed to do something

485
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,840
and we had a couple of people that

486
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,440
stepped in and said that this is the

487
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,280
kind of an architectural question and we

488
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,360
need to make be very careful that we

489
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,640
don't

490
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,679
do anything that paint is into a corner

491
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,640
and

492
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,960
at that time i was a little bit skeptic

493
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,039
but it turns out that they're right yeah

494
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,320
we need to

495
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,679
architect this very carefully

496
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,559
next slide please

497
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,000
so we have a couple of things we

498
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,320
discussed and that we mostly agree on

499
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,039
um

500
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,000
the um

501
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,360
scoped the activities of the design team

502
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,880
to

503
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,120
mpls indicators and

504
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,880
ancillary data and we call this the

505
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,520
miad project

506
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,679
i literally get this disappointed we

507
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,000
couldn't make it meow project but okay

508
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,600
meowth project is producing the spine

509
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,480
indicators carried within the mp label

510
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,360
stack to indicate that there are some

511
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,280
wanted actions that is not clearly

512
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,440
strictly clear from the label itself

513
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,400
anxiety data is carried

514
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,360
with the packet and is

515
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,720
in support for those those actions

516
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,679
ancillary data has

517
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,480
three different forms it can be in stack

518
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,159
data this is

519
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,679
it can be post data or it can be we say

520
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,520
no data and

521
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,840
putting no data there is a little bit of

522
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,200
a stretch but

523
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,360
we have cases so

524
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,840
it's there

525
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,720
next slide please

526
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,159
further

527
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,760
we had agreed on that anything that has

528
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,840
been

529
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,440
specified before must continue to work

530
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,200
whatever the design team does

531
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,880
and we also agree on that after the boss

532
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,600
there can only be one set of ancillary

533
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,660
data

534
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,840
[Music]

535
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,080
and

536
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,520
i think that is one of the important

537
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,000
things we we really have understood over

538
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,679
time

539
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:58,559
uh

540
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,120
anxiety data might be complex and have

541
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,840
structure it might not just be

542
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,760
one value or something it could be

543
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,559
something more complex

544
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,919
and when we

545
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,520
specify new applications

546
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,679
they need to resolve

547
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,400
how to carry indicators and ancillary

548
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,360
data without interfering with the

549
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,960
earliest existence

550
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,480
existing specifications

551
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,200
a

552
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,480
one more slide i think

553
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,400
we have a list of output

554
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,480
we definitely have output from the

555
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,200
design team um

556
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,039
use cases

557
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,960
uh requirement and

558
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,480
a

559
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,240
framework that has taken time things

560
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,640
things has been

561
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,799
uh changing

562
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,880
and we have solutions draft whether they

563
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,000
will be designed team draft

564
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,240
or not is kind of an open question they

565
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,600
might be

566
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,440
individual draft that goes through the

567
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,799
working group as

568
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,760
any other document

569
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,440
i think that was my last slide

570
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,080
wow okay no

571
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,000
uh so we have a couple of things we need

572
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,320
to do

573
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,120
in the near time

574
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,799
uh we should

575
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,880
decide on the format and scope of

576
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
indicators

577
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,440
meaning that

578
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,559
what they point at what what they're

579
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,760
used for

580
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,559
needs to be very clearly specified and

581
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,440
actually

582
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,880
there will be rules for

583
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,760
how they are specified

584
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,480
uh we need to specify scope and format

585
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,279
of in salary data

586
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,799
we have a number of uh

587
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,159
proposals today uh some of them that

588
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,720
not that clearly outspoken

589
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,880
and we need to ensure backwards and

590
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,600
future compatibility

591
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,879
that was the last life

592
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,720
create the urine queue

593
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,520
yeah one thing that i'd like to point

594
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,720
out

595
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,679
when we say ensure backward and future

596
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,240
compatibility

597
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,120
um especially backward compatibility

598
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,240
we have to say that it works as well as

599
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,400
it could

600
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,440
not that it works

601
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
because for example

602
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,360
the first nibble

603
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,159
uh heuristic that says

604
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,480
uh if it is the first nibble is four

605
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,960
then it's an ipv4 packet

606
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,559
that's a broken heuristic

607
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,159
and we've we've mentioned this before

608
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,240
so

609
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,279
we want things to work as they used to

610
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,720
but that doesn't mean that they work

611
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
well

612
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,919
i just want to

613
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,000
sort of underline that

614
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,640
yeah okay yeah i think everyone agrees

615
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,600
to that

616
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,000
it's just

617
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,559
how deep into the details to you at

618
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,240
this type of report

619
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,960
we

620
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,080
we understand that we have things

621
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,559
in current specifications that does not

622
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,919
work well

623
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,720
and they will not work well yes because

624
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,039
the design team does anything

625
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,679
things like that

626
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,919
so

627
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,919
we say instead of saying

628
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,640
backwards compatibility work as well as

629
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,480
they can

630
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,640
but there is a

631
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
limit to that also

632
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,520
they need to work

633
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,880
okay i'm done

634
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,880
thank you lola

635
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,640
i don't see anyone else on the in the

636
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,080
queue so i'll uh

637
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,039
we'll move on to the next uh

638
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,320
presentation

639
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,559
uh let me see if we can find uh

640
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,480
i think it's rakesh who's next

641
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,960
you should be able to see the slides if

642
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,760
not let me know

643
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
thanks tariq i said

644
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,679
you guys hear me yeah yes

645
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,559
okay yeah thanks so uh yeah my name is

646
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,480
rakesh gandhi and i'm presenting the

647
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,520
draft on the encapsulation of stamp for

648
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,919
pseudo-wires in mpls networks

649
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,399
on behalf of the authors they're still

650
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,520
here

651
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,240
next slide please

652
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,840
so the agenda is to look at the

653
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,480
requirements and the scope of the draft

654
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,640
uh the summary of the procedures defined

655
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,559
and the next steps

656
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,360
next slide please

657
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,039
so the requirements and scope

658
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:09,919
so

659
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,960
this is encapsulation of a simple debump

660
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,679
stamp test packets for the mpls to the

661
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,120
wires

662
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,039
we're looking at both the packet suite

663
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,679
and without ip udp header

664
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,480
the motivation there is to uh

665
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,520
because this is for the in-band

666
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,399
stamp so we like to uh follow the same

667
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,440
as

668
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,880
data traffic uh and match their headers

669
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,200
um and also um

670
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,960
need to make sure that uh we're

671
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,760
following the same ecmp part as well as

672
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,360
data traffic

673
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,880
the scope is temp uh the 8762

674
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,720
the stamp extensions in rfc 8972

675
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,440
so these are the the two new rfcs uh

676
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,360
defined in ippm and we are using them

677
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,799
for surewire

678
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,159
uh and uh p2p uh at the moment and uh in

679
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,919
future p2mp uh pls to the wires

680
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,120
and next slide

681
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,039
you prefer to take questions towards the

682
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,880
end or uh

683
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,799
i see people in the queue just uh what's

684
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,799
your preference

685
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,520
uh i'm fine either way um if uh

686
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,320
questions can wait then uh sure uh or we

687
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,039
can take now uh depending on the

688
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,120
so greg if you have questions now we can

689
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,639
take it right

690
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,760
um

691
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,000
i have a question about the requirement

692
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
for

693
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,320
encapsulation without

694
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,120
ipdp header

695
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,640
um

696
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,000
because in my opinion that creates more

697
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,440
complexity

698
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,799
than it

699
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,679
might

700
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,880
bring any benefit so

701
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,399
um

702
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,919
where this requirement is from

703
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,880
yeah so we're trying to uh send the t1

704
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,039
packets uh in band with data traffic um

705
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,600
so along the same path and with the same

706
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,279
header

707
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,399
so there is a data traffic for sudo wire

708
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,799
that has no ip header

709
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,240
and we like to use the same headers uh

710
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,919
as the data traffic with no ip header

711
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,919
to avoid any uh

712
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,840
you know different behavior

713
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,000
the goal here is to measure the accurate

714
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,799
latency and packet loss and whatnot so

715
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,200
you're trying to avoid putting a

716
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,440
ip header that does not really carried

717
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,520
by the data traffic into these pro

718
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,640
packets

719
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,480
and have a different behavior in data

720
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,840
plane

721
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,720
um

722
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,240
well my understanding is that if in mpls

723
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,279
network

724
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,720
we want to um

725
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,840
be in band with a monitored

726
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,840
data flow

727
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,440
well the recommendation is to use

728
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,000
entropy label

729
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,039
so as was discussed and that's part of

730
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,320
the discussion open design team of this

731
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,640
uh first nibble

732
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,760
uh but it's more a hack

733
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,559
so i don't really see that there is a

734
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,679
apparent need to do

735
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,360
without ipedp header

736
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,360
yeah data is not getting a ib

737
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,039
header in in in the pseudo-wire case

738
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,519
then it makes no sense to say pro

739
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,000
packets carry ip header the fabricated

740
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,279
ip header

741
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,360
uh that you had to come up with uh that

742
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,390
can cause uh the other side issues um

743
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,399
[Music]

744
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,720
but normally we do it for their uh all

745
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,120
other oem for bfd for lspping

746
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,080
so uh it's not something new and it's

747
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,720
not really a problem for operations

748
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,320
yeah so here the goal is to measure the

749
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,640
accurate latency so it's important that

750
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,279
uh that the packets uh look and feel

751
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,519
exactly the same as data traffic right

752
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,279
so but coming up with ip header

753
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,880
it would not really look or feel because

754
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,240
uh

755
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,960
again imagine that you are doing

756
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,640
um

757
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,120
tdm uh pseudowire

758
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,039
how your uh

759
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:32,080
stamp packet will look and feel like tdm

760
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,840
yes if data is not carrying ip header uh

761
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,919
you you have probing that using ip

762
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,240
header it's it's a different uh packets

763
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,760
right it's not so so greg and then

764
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,240
maybe maybe this is an interesting thing

765
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,840
to take to the list

766
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,320
um i think it's uh you know it's worth

767
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,480
answering greg's question

768
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,760
um

769
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,559
so

770
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,320
please follow up on the list on that and

771
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,720
let's give stewart a chance to ask his

772
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,080
question

773
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,919
thank you greg thanks

774
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,840
i was going to largely ask exactly the

775
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,559
same question as greg um i think this is

776
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,399
more bandwidth than we get on the list i

777
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,480
think we probably need a group of

778
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,000
interested people to get together and

779
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,600
have a voice conversation as we would

780
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,960
have had at a normal normal ietf

781
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,720
um i can't see any reason why it matters

782
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,200
that there's an ip udp address in there

783
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,320
a header in there because we've been

784
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,720
doing as greg says oam like that for a

785
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,480
long time and since you're using ecmp

786
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,799
well if it's a pseudo wire you shouldn't

787
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,200
be going and looking around below the

788
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,679
stack anyway so it doesn't matter

789
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,440
what is there it's never going to be

790
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,000
interrogated other than as part of a

791
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,480
normal pseudowire operation uh anything

792
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,600
else is not going to go down there

793
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,880
because you're saying you have to put

794
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,399
any a

795
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,880
an entropy label in there so i don't

796
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,919
think you need the complexity of these

797
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,240
these two cases just use one and we

798
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,919
already have one that works which is

799
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,279
using id ip udp

800
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,480
yeah thanks steven

801
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,199
yeah so our next slide please uh so uh

802
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,520
the reference topology here uh we have

803
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,000
stamp uh sender s1 and uh reflector r1

804
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,399
uh we have pseudo wire and the stem

805
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,719
packets follow the pseudo wire

806
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,520
next slide please

807
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,159
so this is the case uh that uh stewart

808
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,119
and gang mentioned about using the ip

809
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,760
v4 and ipv6

810
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,119
ach to carry the stem

811
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,079
uh so there are existing uh acs defined

812
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,560
21 and 57

813
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,000
values for ipv4 ipv6 that's used

814
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,639
and next slide please

815
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,359
and this is the case uh where the ip

816
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,760
header is not used and in this case a

817
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,160
new ach is defined for the session

818
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,520
sender

819
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,240
and next like this

820
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,680
again on the reflector side the

821
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,480
same ipv4 ipv6 ach are used

822
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,200
for the reflector packet

823
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,919
next slide piece

824
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,599
and new ach is defined uh if no ip

825
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,990
header is used

826
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,560
[Music]

827
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,800
in case of the reflector packet

828
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,440
and next like this

829
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,400
so what there is no uh

830
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,720
no way to distinguish the sender and

831
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,599
reflector package so uh in in case of

832
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,920
ip udp there is really people tells you

833
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,400
is a sender packet a reflector packet

834
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,680
and if no ip header is there then the ga

835
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,280
is

836
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,680
the the channel type tells you the

837
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,040
css in the sender or reflector packet

838
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,520
next like this

839
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,640
so welcome your comments and suggestions

840
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,359
uh

841
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,280
we weren't sure about the working group

842
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,599
is mpls or pals

843
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,000
and we are requesting a working group

844
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,040
adoption for this work

845
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,839
yeah thank you

846
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,680
hi steward

847
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,920
so if it's a pseudo wire then obviously

848
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,960
it belongs in um pals question is are

849
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,440
you trying to do mpls instrumentation as

850
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,520
well in which case i think you're in a

851
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,560
whole new construct

852
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,800
no it's it's really encapsulating or for

853
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,560
the studio wires

854
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,440
in that case it belongs in pals um where

855
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,200
all the companion documents were

856
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,599
developed i think

857
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,920
okay

858
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,680
yeah i

859
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
i personally okay so my question is the

860
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,400
clarification on the uh

861
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,880
without ip udp

862
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,000
use case

863
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,680
is it for is it for the case that the

864
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,240
pseudo wire endpoints are not ip capable

865
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,760
uh or i mean

866
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,640
did you clarify that is it that this is

867
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,880
uh this is for the case where the the

868
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,520
data traffic is not carrying the ip

869
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,040
and that so uh

870
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,640
probes have exact same uh encoding as

871
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,480
the data traffic uh of course different

872
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,119
achievements

873
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,520
i see

874
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,480
greg you're back in the queue

875
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,119
i wonder so um

876
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,200
why it's only a three to volcan scooter

877
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,560
wires because

878
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,119
we do have uh

879
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,640
gach

880
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,800
so which is applicable to

881
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,520
mpls and if uh

882
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,960
new ach types are defined

883
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,040
if and when

884
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,599
that seems to be equally applicable to

885
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,240
mpls lsp

886
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,640
definitely uh yeah if it's uh applicable

887
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,599
to mpls then uh i mean so i don't know

888
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,760
if ach

889
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,079
registry belongs to the mpls working

890
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,079
group then the allocation happens in

891
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,400
mpls so it's not clear to me

892
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,960
located

893
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,040
by the ach expert

894
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,560
and um

895
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,000
they've usually been associated with

896
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,200
sudoa

897
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,880
which is where we developed all this in

898
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,400
the first place but it's not a turf

899
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,800
issue here this is about you know doing

900
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,920
the right thing in a simple and

901
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,520
consistent um

902
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,359
simple and consistent way

903
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,560
and

904
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,680
i am very confused as to um

905
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,280
well i think we need to spend more time

906
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,480
talking it through which is why i'm

907
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,440
suggesting a side meeting

908
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,240
yeah thanks steve let's let's do it that

909
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,240
way

910
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,040
thank you rakesh um the next presenter

911
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,839
is

912
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,078
jin

913
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,000
hello you hear me okay

914
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,960
yes i can hear you go ahead yeah uh

915
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,920
hello everybody um

916
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,240
this is the engine so

917
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,040
on behalf of my all my co-authors i'm

918
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,400
going to

919
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,640
present an update of the young data

920
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,839
model for mprs

921
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,760
okay

922
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,720
next slide please

923
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,280
so here are some recaps

924
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,440
msd stands for

925
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,280
sig depths

926
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,960
which were defined

927
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,599
in rfc 8476 and 8491

928
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,440
the

929
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,280
mprs msd model is an augmentation to the

930
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,440
mprs

931
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,880
base model

932
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,280
that was defined in 8960

933
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,400
the content of this draft was originally

934
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,200
part of rfc

935
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,200
920 1920

936
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,800
the young data model for segment routing

937
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,359
it was decided during iesc review of

938
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,359
data rfc to split the content

939
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,160
the the part about msd

940
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,200
as a single as a separate draft because

941
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,119
it's small uh characteristic of mprs

942
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,960
um hence we have this small module here

943
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,839
next slide please

944
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,720
this slide shows the

945
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,440
updated tree diagram

946
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,599
compared with the old one on the right

947
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,920
side you can see that the major change

948
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,280
we did was to make the interface

949
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,640
msd status to augment the mprs interface

950
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,839
instead of all interfaces

951
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:22,800
so

952
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,079
i

953
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,160
the authors believe this makes more

954
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,960
sense things

955
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,920
when the interface is running mprs red

956
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,560
so it has msd

957
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,760
that

958
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,640
next slide please

959
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,160
so uh besides that please remove the

960
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,839
grouping max adapts

961
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,319
because no no other module is really

962
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,000
using it

963
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,040
we updated these security considerations

964
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,520
with small details

965
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,560
class editorial changes

966
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,960
the authors here would like to

967
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,520
thank tongue patch specifically for his

968
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,720
review and comments

969
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,960
next slide please

970
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,280
so next steps

971
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,880
of course we

972
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,240
like to uh address comments if there are

973
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,760
any coming in

974
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,599
in the near future

975
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,079
and the authors believe the draft is

976
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,200
ready for working group adoption

977
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,079
so the question to the chairs is

978
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,800
can we start an adoption call after this

979
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,280
etf

980
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,440
that's it thank you

981
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,400
so to me

982
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,920
and there is a um

983
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,720
the next steps is kind of ambivalent

984
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:00,079
uh you say you want to collect an

985
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,280
address comments okay

986
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,079
and when that is done you want to do the

987
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,400
working group adoption

988
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,599
uh

989
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,760
or are you saying that

990
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,680
you really do work in group adoption

991
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,599
adoption and then others comments that

992
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,359
they come in coming later

993
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:20,960
uh well so

994
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,240
the the comments we received so far have

995
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,319
already been addressed we of course we

996
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,880
welcome people to review

997
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,079
and send them more comments but since

998
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,440
this part of the the document the module

999
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,640
itself was a split of the segment

1000
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,119
routing model it was already intensely

1001
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,760
revealed there so

1002
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,760
i personally am not expecting

1003
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,880
many new comments coming in

1004
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,000
so i i i

1005
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,160
think we should start the working group

1006
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,920
adoption call

1007
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,839
okay i i i understand you uh my i think

1008
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,720
my real question is on the two ball

1009
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,680
bullets on the next step slides

1010
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,000
are the first one

1011
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
uh

1012
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,119
a condition for going further or

1013
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,599
it seems like what you're saying no it's

1014
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:22,640
actually

1015
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,760
you want to do to work in group adoption

1016
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,240
yes i like to study working group

1017
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,640
adoption and meanwhile you know if

1018
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,119
during the adoption process or after the

1019
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,480
adoption

1020
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,640
we'll continue to address the comments i

1021
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,400
don't think they conflict with each

1022
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,720
other

1023
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,319
um

1024
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,839
maybe maybe not

1025
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,800
unless there is strong objection about

1026
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,079
adopting this draft

1027
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,119
i don't really think there is i just

1028
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,560
i think it would be better if the last

1029
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,359
slide said that the request work we

1030
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,680
request working group adoption

1031
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,400
and further comments will be

1032
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,920
addressed during the working group

1033
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,319
process

1034
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:20,640
i think yeah okay oh okay yeah if you

1035
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,359
want i can even change the slide upload

1036
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,040
a new version

1037
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,839
uh

1038
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,079
probably not necessary we have it on in

1039
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,720
the discussion it's fine yeah

1040
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,800
yeah

1041
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,440
hope that doesn't cost much confusion i

1042
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,160
i have a question for you he's in i'll

1043
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,319
go back to the slide

1044
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,599
um i see that you are doing the ms

1045
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,680
deeper interface

1046
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,640
yes

1047
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,960
and uh per node as well or is it uh yeah

1048
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,599
i see it per node and per interface

1049
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,040
is that correct

1050
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,160
okay yes and it is the per node the

1051
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,319
lowest common denominator is that the

1052
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,240
thinking

1053
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,040
uh

1054
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,680
yeah so you can see actually right now

1055
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,160
both for the node and for the link they

1056
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,960
are read only parameters

1057
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,760
so

1058
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,880
it really depends on the implementation

1059
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,160
um if i remember right the definition of

1060
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,560
note one should be the lowest number

1061
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,680
from like if you have colleagues

1062
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,800
you pick the lowest one but really for

1063
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,040
this model we just report

1064
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,480
what what the implementation giving us

1065
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,040
it's not really a configuration

1066
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,560
yeah yeah

1067
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,880
and as far as i remember the the whole

1068
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,000
point is the ingress will use this

1069
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,319
this attribute when it's doing some

1070
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:48,560
computation or path constraint

1071
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,839
igp has i'm not sure if igp has defined

1072
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,000
i know they have defined per capability

1073
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,240
per node but i'm not sure per interface

1074
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,920
over a link

1075
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,400
uh so so what is the ability

1076
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,319
of the printer i'm questioning the

1077
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,599
utility of

1078
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,720
reporting per interface is it useful was

1079
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,079
it something that igp folks also have uh

1080
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,760
you're planning to do

1081
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,200
have you researched it so after this

1082
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,000
we

1083
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,960
created this new mode small module here

1084
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,760
in mprs we also create a separate one

1085
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,000
for ict you know for iss and ospf each

1086
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,480
so it's pretty much the the same thing

1087
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,400
it's just inside the icp

1088
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,400
module icp only you know populate such

1089
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,680
information right yeah there is a for

1090
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,680
example ospf

1091
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,480
sr msd something that

1092
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,559
purple link or per node

1093
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,400
per link

1094
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,760
for both okay

1095
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,800
yeah okay that was my question

1096
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,319
yeah jeffrey

1097
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:59,040
oh jeff i think you're in you you're in

1098
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,280
the queue you want to ask go ahead

1099
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,400
thank you

1100
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,480
i think jen question for you the the

1101
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,440
authors

1102
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,200
uh has there been discussion about

1103
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,480
having a

1104
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,400
return value for when the node

1105
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,319
understands what an msd is but it

1106
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:15,920
doesn't know what it is for some reason

1107
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,880
sorry i didn't get your question if the

1108
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,800
note get the value but doesn't

1109
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,200
understand what it is

1110
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,160
so the the node is of a software lineage

1111
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,839
that understands what msd means

1112
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,839
but for some reason it is unable to

1113
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:35,319
determine the value

1114
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,480
so

1115
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,760
right now

1116
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,880
um

1117
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,200
like i just mentioned this one is a read

1118
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,599
only right so it really depends on

1119
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:46,960
i guess for most

1120
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,839
vendors this depends on the hardware so

1121
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,720
whatever the value reported from the the

1122
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,599
lower level the hardware level

1123
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,880
and the software is just you know you

1124
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,559
can only use what

1125
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,319
information available

1126
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,359
okay i i don't think you understand i

1127
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,640
will send my message to the list

1128
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,119
yeah maybe i didn't yeah i didn't get

1129
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,559
our question i guess

1130
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,960
i'm building my questions on my question

1131
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,200
on the next question on top of jeff's

1132
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,160
question

1133
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,200
um you have msd type there

1134
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,480
is that to indicate that you can have

1135
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,680
a

1136
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,640
label type and then a byte uh you can do

1137
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,680
by per

1138
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,000
per byte or for label

1139
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,200
and why is there a segment there why is

1140
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,359
it the label depth because you're

1141
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,800
talking about mpls

1142
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,960
where is there a label

1143
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,880
the ms tab is actually

1144
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,598
so you have maximum segment depth

1145
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,000
i mean if we are talking about mpls it's

1146
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,720
label depth right

1147
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,920
yes

1148
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,640
it's the label depth yeah

1149
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,760
okay so

1150
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,119
then you more suitable is label depth

1151
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,319
then why do you have a type and value

1152
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,359
the tab is defined in the

1153
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,319
uh the in the rfc

1154
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,240
8276

1155
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,440
and it's also possible you the

1156
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,800
entropy label rate depth

1157
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,440
not only just how many you know so far

1158
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,160
you know future there might be more

1159
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,000
depth but right now

1160
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,319
uh if i remember right there are the

1161
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,520
like the number of maximum label you can

1162
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,960
read

1163
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,800
also the

1164
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,920
where the entropy label depth you can

1165
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,160
read

1166
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,480
we actually

1167
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,839
running on toilets time now so we have

1168
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,559
to take this to the list um

1169
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,160
yeah

1170
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,400
let toilet start

1171
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,119
uh

1172
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,000
yeah

1173
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,119
ac is in the queue as well as storeless

1174
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,240
i think tortoise is going to present uh

1175
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,960
yeah ac we have to apologize i think

1176
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,960
we're running out of time sorry okay

1177
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,319
okay

1178
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:19,520
um

1179
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,359
i'm gonna approve uh

1180
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,280
doorless i think you should be able to

1181
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,280
share

1182
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,720
right thank you very much so um i wanted

1183
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,079
to talk a little bit about the

1184
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,960
deterministic qs for the mpls data plane

1185
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,480
uh considerations um i have one draft um

1186
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,240
that i'm trying to promote to get into

1187
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,680
that net there's also work beyond that

1188
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,880
um so

1189
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,160
um

1190
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,920
i really would would love to see more

1191
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,839
people from from mpls site to get

1192
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,240
involved in that net and see how we can

1193
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,760
get that draft adopted and i think

1194
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,680
the reason for that is what i wanted to

1195
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,520
high level up here the details of the

1196
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,559
draft

1197
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,520
mpls is i'm going to present in that net

1198
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,160
and i did present in an interim so right

1199
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,440
now

1200
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,839
the mpls forwarding plane only allows to

1201
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:20,640
support per hop per flow bounded latency

1202
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,720
solutions which means that for every

1203
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,440
flow on every hop we need to instantiate

1204
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,160
a shaper or interleaved regulator so on

1205
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,319
any mplsp router

1206
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,319
so there there are different shapers

1207
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:35,920
there is rfc 2212 and there's iets and

1208
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,240
asynchronous traffic shaper but uh the

1209
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,280
fundamental issue of course is um

1210
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,040
that um

1211
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,599
this is highly undesirable um you know

1212
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,760
in our typical mpls service provider

1213
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,480
designs which means segment routing

1214
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,319
networks but we really want to have per

1215
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,960
hop per flow stateless behavior but

1216
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,119
instead source routing so that we have

1217
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,040
scalability load churn of the control

1218
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,760
plane and so on

1219
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,960
and

1220
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,200
that doesn't work with these because

1221
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,880
they basically

1222
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,960
every every shaper needs to be

1223
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,880
instantiated

1224
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,119
from

1225
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:16,800
an mpls label um srp label there in in

1226
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,480
the label stack and um

1227
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:22,800
there is

1228
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,800
the the total number of the shapers that

1229
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,640
you would need could easily get into the

1230
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,319
tenth of thousands in a large service

1231
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:30,240
provider networks and i think we've got

1232
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,040
good experience that even you know this

1233
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,760
this number of um you know just routing

1234
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,520
uh states or so is something that we

1235
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,839
really don't want when we can avoid it

1236
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,160
um there is another you know more

1237
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,760
application-centric issue and that is

1238
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,400
that the shaper solutions do introduce

1239
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,200
the maximum amount of jitter um because

1240
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,400
um as

1241
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,760
soon as there is no competing traffic um

1242
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,160
the curing latency is zero and with the

1243
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,480
maximum amount of competing traffic you

1244
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,960
have the maximum queuing latency so and

1245
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,720
this is really highly undesirable

1246
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,559
especially a lot of industrial

1247
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,599
applications as we we we've learned over

1248
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,440
the years so

1249
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,359
really the industry would like to have a

1250
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,480
lower jitter solution and i did present

1251
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,280
in in that net uh example um you know

1252
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,160
reasons for that in including the need

1253
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,240
to otherwise have more time clock

1254
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,720
synchronization and more difficult

1255
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,839
end-user devices

1256
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,680
so

1257
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,520
now what options do we have to overcome

1258
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,280
this and and they're really two two

1259
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,079
solutions right one is i think without

1260
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,240
extension changes to the mpls packet

1261
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,839
header processing

1262
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:42,000
and that's really the draft that i think

1263
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,079
we should start looking into first that

1264
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,480
i have in that net which is this um you

1265
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,319
know

1266
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,160
tc qf

1267
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,520
which is per

1268
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,760
per flow stateless a very low jitter

1269
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,599
independent of the path property so the

1270
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,200
jitter doesn't go up with the number of

1271
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,680
ops or the per hop latency

1272
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,240
and it purely relies on using the

1273
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,319
traffic class value in the mpls label to

1274
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:09,200
indicate um you know the the uh

1275
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,440
additionally necessary parameter to

1276
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,839
enable this qs and and and it is per

1277
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:16,640
flow stateless um

1278
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,440
so we need three to five of those

1279
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,359
tc values

1280
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,119
so i think this is really the only short

1281
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,000
term option for no mpls packet header

1282
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,520
changes

1283
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,240
and it is not vaporware but instead it

1284
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,920
was validated

1285
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,319
in a 2 000 kilometer wide area network

1286
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:37,119
with 100 gigabit or faster high-speed

1287
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,440
wind routers and you know fairly simple

1288
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,240
you know us fpga code

1289
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,399
on the on the qs chips there

1290
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,640
now when we do uh uh think about

1291
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,200
extensions uh and changes to the mpls

1292
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,200
packet header and processing there are

1293
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,280
really various options and i think those

1294
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,440
would all be interesting to look into

1295
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,599
but it's really dangerous to think that

1296
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,599
we could standardize you know

1297
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,760
non-extensible solutions now and i don't

1298
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,640
really think we know exactly how to make

1299
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,400
them extensible now because we didn't

1300
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,839
have the discussion

1301
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:14,640
right so um

1302
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,400
because i think there there there are

1303
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,559
also more qs things so for both for

1304
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:20,960
deadnet and beyond and mpls uh where we

1305
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,440
want to have better qs and and so it

1306
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,079
really goes into the need to have more

1307
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,160
of a design team for that and it would

1308
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,760
be great if we wouldn't have to do that

1309
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,720
only for mpls because the same type of

1310
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,640
issues really exist in the very same way

1311
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,040
for ipv6

1312
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,079
so

1313
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,160
here's just a little excerpt you know

1314
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,920
how that

1315
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,760
tech cycle queueing and forwarding works

1316
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,079
it's pretty much based on the 12 year

1317
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,720
old tsn solution cyclic cueing and

1318
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,880
forwarding packets are simply forwarded

1319
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,960
bucket by bucket hop by hop

1320
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,200
into cycles and

1321
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,240
then

1322
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,040
that

1323
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,799
effectively means that the latency on a

1324
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:02,319
hopper basis is exactly one such

1325
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,799
cycle latency and of course the jitter

1326
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:07,119
is then the the cycle jitter which can

1327
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,880
be hundred microseconds

1328
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,240
um and

1329
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,000
the main thing that needed to be done to

1330
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
make this technology work for large

1331
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,400
networks was to really put the cycle

1332
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,040
number into the packet so that um you

1333
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:19,920
know

1334
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,200
in tsn a packet is received

1335
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,520
into the cycle based on its timestamp

1336
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,720
and obviously you know when you have

1337
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,079
latency on links and when you have

1338
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,319
jitter uh that doesn't work so that's

1339
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:32,160
why the cycle number needs to be in the

1340
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,319
packet that's why we need to find

1341
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:35,920
something in a packet header to do it

1342
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,799
and that's why a small cycle number from

1343
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,680
one to three is is kind of the the best

1344
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,359
thing we can get out of the existing

1345
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,599
forwarding plane with the traffic class

1346
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,520
bits

1347
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,480
so now um yeah and we also are doing um

1348
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,400
you know pseudo code so it hopefully

1349
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,880
should be easy to understand how how you

1350
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,559
know easy this ultimately is in the

1351
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:59,040
forwarding plane what needs to be done

1352
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,799
and then it would obviously work exactly

1353
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:03,119
the same way not only for mpls but also

1354
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,920
for the ip data plane in that net with

1355
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,720
three to five dscp values which isn't

1356
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,119
really you know a strong you know a

1357
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,920
priority for us now but which obviously

1358
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,640
gives safety in terms of saying that

1359
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,640
this can be done without data plane

1360
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,640
changes for both of our data planes in

1361
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,480
devnet

1362
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,559
okay so i was talking about you know

1363
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:26,400
extensible qs header and here's a little

1364
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,079
bit kind of that

1365
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,040
first round highlight of um what all the

1366
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,880
issues are that i think we haven't

1367
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,079
tackled uh with qs.net and beyond right

1368
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,280
so the first thing is that um the pre-op

1369
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,119
you know we've done that for mpls but

1370
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,839
not for ip so um you know given how in

1371
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,400
the mpls design team there were thoughts

1372
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,720
of uh you know having headers that would

1373
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,319
be equally able to attach to mpls and to

1374
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:54,319
ip something like for pre-off would make

1375
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,640
a lot of sense for that

1376
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,440
the

1377
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,319
bounded latency the alternatives to

1378
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,319
the tcqf solution

1379
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,720
there are other alternatives i myself

1380
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,000
presented one more new um thing into a

1381
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,920
research conference but there have been

1382
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,720
a lot of you know ideas in that space in

1383
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,880
the past 30 years and they all may need

1384
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,280
some different but a lot more new packet

1385
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,559
header

1386
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,799
than you know just three bits so for

1387
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:22,480
example my solution would require a

1388
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,520
timestamp 16-bit a priority which might

1389
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,359
be a sequence of four bit values and

1390
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,680
other solutions might want to have you

1391
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,160
know other packet header extensions and

1392
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,640
then you know there are beyond that net

1393
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,280
things where really we haven't had

1394
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,599
really good discussions um the most

1395
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:42,319
obvious one from the pragmatic side is

1396
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:44,799
uh you know just the dscp side the beer

1397
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:47,040
header for example which was designed to

1398
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:51,040
support both um mpls and ip already has

1399
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,359
dscp that makes it a lot easier when

1400
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:56,480
you're passing ip multicast over mpls

1401
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,680
not to have to bother with the

1402
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,799
differences between tc and dscp so that

1403
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:03,520
would also be very lovely to have for

1404
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,799
operational simplification in an mpls

1405
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,319
extension header

1406
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,000
and there are other you know cool things

1407
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,799
so for example the ecn stuff in l4s

1408
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:14,559
they're struggling with just two ecn

1409
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:16,720
bits uh if if there were more this would

1410
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,359
be a lot easier there is uh you know for

1411
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:20,960
bandwidth management there were really

1412
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,119
good drafts where you have a weighted uh

1413
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,160
bandwidth parameter um and so i think

1414
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,680
there there's a lot more and the

1415
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,520
question is you know what scope would we

1416
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,079
want to take into account uh initially

1417
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:34,240
but you know how could we make um you

1418
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,880
know mpls extension headers easily

1419
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,040
enough extensible right do we you know

1420
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,680
like in ipv6 need to create for every

1421
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,760
new parameter a new extension header do

1422
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,000
we use a tlv or so on right so i think

1423
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,720
those are the questions that would be

1424
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,799
lovely to to tackle more but we need

1425
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:53,119
more qs people in there and not only the

1426
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,280
mpls header folks

1427
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,079
right so summary would really be lovely

1428
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:00,400
to see um you know one really well

1429
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,319
working proving service provider class

1430
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,799
bounded latency solution for net with

1431
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:07,280
mpls that's usable now i think that's

1432
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,559
our draft

1433
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,319
that we have so it would be great to see

1434
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,319
support for that um you know or

1435
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,720
questions if you don't understand it um

1436
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,480
but then of course would also be great

1437
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,440
to start the longer term qs effort to go

1438
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,880
along with the mpls design team effort

1439
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,359
and i guess you know yeah the reaching

1440
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:27,520
out to the transport area and the qs

1441
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,920
folks there is is certainly a big part

1442
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,839
of that um and i'll see what i can get

1443
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:34,000
done there

1444
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,960
yep and that's it thank you very much

1445
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,520
so carlos

1446
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,720
uh what

1447
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,400
do you want to get

1448
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,640
from presenting this

1449
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,920
here in the mpls working group

1450
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,480
right so i think it was as i said in the

1451
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,359
summary right so the one thing was for

1452
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,680
the mpls folks to try to understand this

1453
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,440
problem um

1454
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,200
which is that

1455
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,839
if we want to have deadnet be a future

1456
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:05,520
driver for mpls networks we need to have

1457
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,079
a bounded latency solution that fits

1458
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:10,240
service provider requirements

1459
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,039
and that is that draft right so i'm

1460
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:15,440
looking for support for that draft even

1461
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,440
if it's obviously you know happening in

1462
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,920
that net but i think the kind of more

1463
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,079
use case in terms representation of the

1464
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,400
interests of service provider networks

1465
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,640
with mpls that's to be found here in the

1466
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,960
mpls working group that's why i'm kind

1467
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,480
of you know the you're you're kind of

1468
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,200
the the network owner working group um

1469
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,280
so that's just you know please come to

1470
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,000
that net and and and and work on this

1471
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
and the other the second part was really

1472
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,720
about my thoughts on you know what

1473
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,799
that that we have a complex

1474
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:48,880
space of problems for us to solve before

1475
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,039
converging on i think more extensible

1476
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:52,720
better

1477
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,160
qs

1478
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,640
extension headers for mpls in the mpls

1479
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,720
design team and that we shouldn't think

1480
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,799
that any single extension piece that

1481
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:01,920
we've seen

1482
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,799
now might be something that is valid

1483
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:06,599
long term but that you know

1484
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:09,359
extensibility in an efficient way might

1485
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:11,440
be the first important thing to think

1486
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,599
about for qs

1487
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:17,200
functions in the mpls design team

1488
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,078
okay thank you

1489
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,200
okay

1490
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,799
we have one person in the queue but

1491
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:30,720
we're out of time

1492
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,599
so if this is quick uh um

1493
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:36,240
go ahead otherwise i think uh

1494
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,559
you know we have to take it to the list

1495
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:41,039
uh it's very quick actually so one uh

1496
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:43,119
comment i had was the it's very loaded

1497
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,599
topic definitely uh turnless you're

1498
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:48,079
comparing with cqf and ats stuff so

1499
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,000
basically this is a neat lot of

1500
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,160
understanding of dsn technologies and

1501
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,799
also the requirements to differentiate

1502
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:55,680
this

1503
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,400
uh so but the question relevant here is

1504
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,160
that you're asking for the tcn which

1505
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,480
three to five for the cq of stuff right

1506
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,720
so it happened in the

1507
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,000
tsu working group also for the l4s we

1508
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,440
don't have that many bits right we have

1509
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,839
only three bits here so how do you get

1510
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:13,839
five values out of it

1511
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:15,839
yes it's three bits that's eight values

1512
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:18,559
and i i i'm saying we need three to five

1513
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:20,079
values

1514
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:21,520
out of the eight

1515
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,440
yeah even getting one or two there

1516
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,039
itself is getting difficult right so

1517
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:26,720
that was happening yes we were in group

1518
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:30,000
discussions during l4s so think about it

1519
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,799
so you might have to go to mplsdt

1520
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:35,280
uh for extensible stuff

1521
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,760
yeah yeah i i think that's that's that's

1522
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,760
a question of you know how are you

1523
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,960
