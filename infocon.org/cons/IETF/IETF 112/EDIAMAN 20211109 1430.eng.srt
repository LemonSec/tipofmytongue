1
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,520
okay we have one

2
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,680
we have had one minute of

3
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,119
charity for latecomers

4
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,799
i suppose it's time to get the show on

5
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,960
the road

6
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,680
let me check

7
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,120
so we have mana and we have

8
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,959
to summa so we have both the presenters

9
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,599
and we have we have me which is actually

10
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,800
first present that's good

11
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,599
hello everyone

12
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,200
i do miss the

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,800
hello chairman or something

14
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,319
seeing that people are actually awake

15
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,200
but

16
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,640
you can't win them all i suppose

17
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,959
hello chairman we're

18
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:41,690
we're awake

19
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,840
[Laughter]

20
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,720
nice to see you again

21
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,560
so it's uh

22
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
it's a bit like speaking into the void

23
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,040
when you do this

24
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,560
but anyway

25
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,879
we're at the at the itf we're at the

26
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,640
working group meeting

27
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,480
we have a working group it's called

28
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
mediaman

29
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,840
we have an

30
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,480
hour

31
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,800
and the first thing to do is always note

32
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,040
well

33
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,599
we all seen it before

34
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,360
if you haven't then

35
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,480
you really need to need it read it

36
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,640
and

37
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,720
there are rules

38
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,360
if you follow the rules

39
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,799
and

40
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,879
the internet works better if you don't

41
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,280
follow the rules

42
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,799
well

43
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,879
the itf is going certainly going to work

44
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,480
slower

45
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,640
so let's follow the rules and make

46
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,040
progress

47
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:41,840
so

48
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,319
one hour of again then

49
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,519
and

50
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,120
we've got basically three things to talk

51
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,080
about

52
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,319
one is the

53
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,680
as an order of importance of the charter

54
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,000
it's principles for what new top level

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,879
types it's

56
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,080
the haptics top-level type proposal

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,319
and it's a question of multiple suffixes

58
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,040
for media types

59
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,439
so i allocated about 50 minutes for each

60
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,560
but

61
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,879
first we have the traditional

62
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,920
moment of silence we need someone to

63
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,959
someone to sign up to describe

64
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,440
do we have a volunteer

65
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,080
okay phil helen baker is volunteering

66
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,039
thank you thank you

67
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,080
and uh

68
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,000
i do see this uh

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,240
hedgehog thing that i have never seen

70
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,479
before

71
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,880
if you take notes for yourself then

72
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,840
you have to

73
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,560
upload them afterwards somewhere so

74
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,520
let's get into business

75
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,359
principle for new top level types

76
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,440
so

77
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,840
for those who haven't been here as long

78
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,039
as i have

79
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,000
a little bit of history

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
when i walked into the itf in 1991

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,680
one of the first things i encountered

82
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,520
was the discussion on

83
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,600
how do we

84
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,600
have multiple media types inside mail

85
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,400
and the result was

86
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,880
rsc 1341

87
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,360
it was adopted in various places

88
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,000
including email of course and also a net

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,560
news http rtp

90
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,080
and so on

91
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,520
after a while we figured out that

92
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,520
registration procedures were important

93
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,919
i can't spell

94
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,000
and broke them out into rc 2048

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,520
and revised them a couple of times

96
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,600
and if you read them

97
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,639
from a sociological viewpoint and not

98
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,840
from a not strictly as a technical

99
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,080
viewpoint you will see that

100
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,759
we have many

101
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,440
made many attempts at

102
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,319
directing how media types should be used

103
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,080
what the principles are and what

104
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,160
and what people should do and register

105
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,319
them and

106
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,000
well

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,680
i wouldn't say that all those attempts

108
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
were successful

109
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,039
the world does as the world does

110
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,919
so

111
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,720
one of the big discussions in 1991 was

112
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,360
between should we have flat space of of

113
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,039
mine of types or should we have a

114
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,199
hierarchical

115
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,199
and

116
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,039
the thing we landed on was a two level

117
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,960
type system

118
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,880
where you have the top level type and

119
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,880
the subtype

120
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,800
and this was actually a compromise

121
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,680
and

122
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,440
so when we

123
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,479
grew up a little more we found out that

124
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,400
some types were standard and some were

125
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,160
not standard perhaps we should actually

126
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,960
show those in to the names so we

127
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,240
went with a pre the faceted namespace

128
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,400
with vendor and prefix

129
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,080
and personal

130
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,919
and as separate from standards

131
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:28,840
this

132
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,440
was i would say not the roaring success

133
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,520
people didn't see very much

134
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,120
usage used for those prefixes and

135
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,880
thought that it was much nicer just to

136
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,680
sit to squat on a name until

137
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
everyone agreed that this this was the

138
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,319
name to use

139
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,280
and we did structure suffixes which has

140
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,560
had slightly more uptake

141
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,840
with the

142
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,560
plus xml being the

143
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,800
the first suffix

144
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,520
and the premier suffix for some time

145
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,919
and

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,919
there have been a few other suffixes

147
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,919
registered

148
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,280
so

149
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,479
for top level types

150
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,400
we had the original set

151
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,800
text image video audio application

152
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,240
message

153
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,919
multipart i forgot to write that though

154
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,599
we added model in 1997

155
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,519
and nobody cares

156
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,640
added example in 2006

157
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,039
why should i work here

158
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,839
and

159
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,000
we added font in 2017

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,839
which was uh

161
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,080
kind of well someone was already using

162
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,760
it so we should just admit it

163
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,480
this comes by

164
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,839
so new top level types are rare i mean

165
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,920
we go

166
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,880
10 years without adding one

167
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,480
easily

168
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,880
but

169
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,519
it's still unclear why we add them

170
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,279
and it still don't care how we measure

171
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,040
whether

172
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,920
it was good or not

173
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,640
so this was a brief look back at history

174
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,920
so

175
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,160
if you look at the charter for this work

176
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,560
group

177
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,440
my personal opinion is that well

178
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,839
that one of the success criteria for

179
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,120
working group is that it ends

180
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,760
and so when this work group is completed

181
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,120
if we have something

182
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,680
we can point to saying this is how we

183
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,480
decide if we need a top level type

184
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,120
that's success

185
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,640
and i mean

186
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,760
if what we point to is a document saying

187
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,600
the decider decides

188
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,399
that's okay too

189
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,800
but i do think that we can do slightly

190
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,120
better

191
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,480
so

192
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,600
with that

193
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,680
i'll just open the floor

194
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,600
open the queue

195
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,040
and see

196
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,760
who wants to comment on

197
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,959
criteria for top level types

198
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,800
please speak up

199
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,760
um this is more a question actually for

200
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,440
you harold or anyone who has those

201
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,519
experiences a long time is

202
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,279
it seems to me that in the way these are

203
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,760
actually used that you could actually

204
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,519
remove the top level type and it would

205
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,040
make absolutely no difference to

206
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,800
anything like it's not like the con it's

207
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,560
not like the subtypes ever managed to

208
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,200
conflict that we had a like two subtypes

209
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,800
that had the same different top levels i

210
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,320
understand how people use the subtypes

211
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,519
yeah sure you want to know it's an image

212
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,480
jpeg but um you know as long as we don't

213
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,680
ever you know name an audio format jpeg

214
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,959
um i i i don't know so this just comes

215
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,000
back to

216
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,160
like

217
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,320
does this actually matter in practical

218
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,200
use in any way whatsoever

219
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,959
well i i could actually make the

220
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,360
opposite argument that they're harmful

221
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,880
we have a couple of

222
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,959
subtypes

223
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:33,920
that

224
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,640
exist in

225
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,760
in multiple namespaces

226
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,000
for artificials

227
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,000
because uh

228
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,480
so we have

229
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,639
uh

230
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,320
these are like redundancy type and

231
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,240
forward encoding type like like error

232
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,839
recovery mechanisms that would work for

233
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,279
multiple different types of media are

234
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,959
those the ones you think you know yes

235
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,959
and and there's a particular text type

236
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,279
that we that people want more than

237
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,839
multiplex like just country

238
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,279
oh the t140 stuff or no t140 that's what

239
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,720
that's what i think of

240
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,720
that we registered as vegas did three

241
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
times because it had to be an another

242
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,399
top level type

243
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,120
and the decision design decisions in sdp

244
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,720
were

245
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,800
uh forcing forcing us to regis register

246
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,480
multiple times if we wanted a

247
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,480
multiplexed now we fix that

248
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,719
so

249
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,040
there are there are

250
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,959
there are things that have the same name

251
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,800
in multiple spaces yes but they're not

252
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,479
conflicts that's as far for now

253
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,839
okay

254
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,079
phil

255
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,440
i was going to say what cullen just said

256
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,680
and when he said it i suddenly realized

257
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,480
that

258
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,040
actually he's wrong

259
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,959
sorry um

260
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,480
there is one case in which the top level

261
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,440
type

262
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,200
is actually used and it's inside the web

263
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,040
browser

264
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,680
in that there's a content negotiation

265
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,600
scheme in there

266
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,639
and so it does actually make sense

267
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,519
to negotiate between

268
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,600
you know i've got this image in three

269
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,639
different

270
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,399
formats you can have it in jpeg png

271
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,399
or gif

272
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,600
um

273
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,440
and so

274
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,480
if it is used anywhere at all

275
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,279
that is where the top level uh thing is

276
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,560
used

277
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,160
and not necessarily in the browser

278
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,399
um it's possible that it is used in

279
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,160
the servers

280
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,440
and the platforms

281
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,880
underlying

282
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,399
but

283
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,560
if not i mean like if it's not used

284
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,680
there

285
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,600
it probably isn't used anywhere you can

286
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,320
just ignore it

287
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,040
johnson i think you have an rtp

288
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,800
can explain the rtp situation better

289
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
than me

290
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,560
i pro i probably could but that's not

291
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,959
what i came to talk about here today

292
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,959
uh what i was actually going to ask is i

293
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,880
um

294
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,639
yeah i mean i think well i'm just if you

295
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,079
do want to ask but the rtp thing was

296
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,040
kind of

297
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,399
far as i know a hack which is that

298
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,240
somebody noticed that

299
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,279
the

300
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,839
uh me the m-line formats that stp was

301
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,160
using where this mat happened to match

302
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,000
the um

303
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
the media types they were using for mime

304
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,199
and said oh hey we should make these the

305
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,720
same thing which i'm not positive was a

306
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,760
good idea um but because

307
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,839
the packetization for file formats and

308
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,000
packetization for rdp encoding are

309
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,760
really not the same thing at all um

310
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,360
but

311
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,560
um

312
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,920
what i was actually going to ask is i

313
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,560
seem to recall when the thing with the

314
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,720
font top level type came around that

315
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,320
somebody was claiming that

316
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,800
various

317
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,120
content inspection tools

318
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,639
are

319
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,440
more

320
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,720
paranoid about things labeled

321
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,480
application slack they are about other

322
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,519
types

323
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,199
even if they're unknown pipes that they

324
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,480
think oh this is something that could be

325
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,720
active content i'm going to

326
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,360
reject that or if it is not

327
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
you know application slash

328
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,760
i'm gonna be more you know tolerant out

329
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,720
because it's probably something that's

330
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,639
safe that's all the people wanted

331
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,279
font flash rather than applications

332
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,160
whatever

333
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,320
uh is that true or was that

334
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,160
me misunderstanding or

335
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,480
misinformation at the time or rumor or

336
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,199
what did anybody know

337
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,880
like they got it into the text of the

338
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,000
rsc that's all i know

339
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,120
i know it's probably a little slight

340
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,519
answer that uh i think that whatever i

341
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,360
mean i know firewalls content protection

342
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,040
systems used to look at that long ago

343
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,800
i'm not sure they've like had very

344
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,079
intelligent things to do with it they

345
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,759
probably checked that if you pretended a

346
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,560
jpeg was audio that nice vice versa

347
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,399
but i mean i

348
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,160
the type of firewall is pretty much gone

349
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,600
at this point i mean i only know who

350
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,360
makes them anymore so i

351
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,199
if it was you know i suspect that

352
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,120
information is becoming rapidly not true

353
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,839
there was a series of hacks that were

354
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,880
that involved sending something with a

355
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,440
with a particular media type or

356
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,519
file name suffix and then having the

357
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,120
content be

358
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,680
content sniffed by a dispatcher

359
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,000
which would then happily dispatch it to

360
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,839
something that was completely different

361
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,480
from the content type

362
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,040
and so

363
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,800
i mean

364
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,440
insecure insecures want to be insecure

365
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,680
phil

366
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,040
just following on from what colin says

367
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,079
yes the the perimeter firewall is gone

368
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,880
but there is actually a firewall inside

369
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,160
the platform in many cases

370
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,880
so

371
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,880
it's possible that it is used there

372
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,119
again

373
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:18,240
i i i'm not a strong advocate for it

374
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,799
alexey

375
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,439
yeah uh just um repeating something that

376
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,000
was mentioned on chat by madden myself

377
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,880
is

378
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,520
that top level type is used in

379
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,760
among other systems you know in ml

380
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,480
systems deciding top level processing

381
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,799
for certain groups of things

382
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,200
um

383
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,440
so yeah i don't think eliminating it is

384
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,840
going to be

385
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,280
useful

386
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,520
at this point um

387
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,679
we can decide we don't want to create

388
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,840
more categories that that would be a

389
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,919
fair discussion

390
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:58,799
uh

391
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,039
but i think um

392
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,720
removing and making everything um being

393
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,039
equally registerable under any top-level

394
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,960
media type that would not be a good

395
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,600
thing probably

396
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,400
yeah

397
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
so i think that uh

398
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,400
we're more more or less saying that uh

399
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,720
we like we have like top level types

400
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,679
before because they're pretty and uh

401
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,600
and nobody really

402
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,000
cares what the top level type is that

403
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,919
they care about the whole string

404
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,360
or at least that's what they should be

405
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,960
doing

406
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,080
jonathan

407
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,520
actually that's not true

408
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,600
if you know it's a multi-part you want

409
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
to handle it very differently from the

410
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,520
rest of it and you can do it generically

411
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,760
in many cases so yeah that's not yeah

412
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,080
yeah i think certain certain top-level

413
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,640
types get special treatment but

414
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,240
you know there's a the they all

415
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,280
everything would have you know

416
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,760
everything else but anyway

417
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,559
right

418
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,120
there's no there you know

419
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,400
nothing is probably going to panic if it

420
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,679
sees the top level type it doesn't know

421
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,600
about it'll just say this is the create

422
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,760
this like like a you know like

423
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,600
everything else so i guess my question

424
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,880
is if we don't care about top level

425
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,960
types it seems like the two choices we

426
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,080
could make

427
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,960
were

428
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,600
never having top level types or

429
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,120
sure everyone could have a top level

430
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,280
type you know register google slash if

431
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,880
you want um

432
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,720
so

433
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
i think email or maybe not quite that

434
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,480
free form but you know something a

435
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,720
pretty open iana registry if we don't

436
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,320
care about top level types would seem to

437
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,600
be

438
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,280
a friendlier choice than no everything

439
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,799
in the future forever is going to go

440
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,799
under application if it's not one of the

441
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,960
other

442
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,600
so

443
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,880
i'm going to

444
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,080
to claim that we're closing the queue

445
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,679
just about now so

446
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,840
so

447
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,679
just just to keep on schedule and we

448
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,159
have a perfectly worked example of a new

449
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,880
top level type coming up this next item

450
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,720
johnson

451
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,440
where you finished

452
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,039
canon you have the last word

453
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,360
okay i just wanna i i'm not saying this

454
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
changes any conclusion we do on this but

455
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,240
like the the multi-part thing is that

456
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,679
the top level doesn't matter it's the

457
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,000
multi-part mix multi-part parallel those

458
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,600
matter i mean the thing has to

459
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,360
understand the sub-level it's not the

460
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,679
top level that matters in email yes the

461
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,280
top level it checks the string because

462
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,720
it expects the string to be there but if

463
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,799
that it doesn't really need it in any

464
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,880
way because it's not like it deals

465
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,200
completely if it it sees a second level

466
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,640
after multipart it doesn't understand

467
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,000
there's nothing it can do with it right

468
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,559
it might right and similarly with

469
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,000
scanning email and everything you have

470
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,440
to understand the subtype it's all the

471
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,679
subtype that's being understood not you

472
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,280
know as long as the subtypes didn't

473
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,559
conflict

474
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,480
i the top level doesn't actually do

475
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,080
anything for any email scanner or

476
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,400
firewall scanner i've ever seen so

477
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,919
um because they have to understand the

478
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,520
subtype to be able to do anything with

479
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,679
it um so i mean i think if we're going

480
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,120
to design something here that's going to

481
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,679
be good or we're going to argue strongly

482
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,960
there's a strong design constraint

483
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,559
somewhere another we would have to just

484
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,039
find a use case that really required you

485
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,440
to understand the top level but be able

486
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,280
to totally ignore those sub levels

487
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,440
underneath of that and i i no one's

488
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,760
brought one up here so um i think that

489
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,880
makes a strong argument this doesn't

490
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,240
matter much one way or another whatever

491
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,200
we do

492
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,440
thanks

493
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,840
yeah i'll say what's that the response

494
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,000
are you just left in the queue

495
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,799
yes it's a response actually both ned

496
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,480
and myself are screaming that's not

497
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,600
correct

498
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,120
i

499
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,880
i can handle any multi-part slash full

500
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,679
in my webml client

501
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,039
just fine

502
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,240
without knowing what it is

503
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,000
and this is handled by knowing it's a

504
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,760
multi-part slash

505
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,880
so um

506
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,280
there aren't many that many examples of

507
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,559
things like this but there are examples

508
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,360
yeah

509
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,520
okay thank you for the discussion i will

510
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,400
i will now switch slide sets if i can

511
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,200
figure out how to do that

512
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,240
stop slideshare

513
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,840
and

514
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,559
haptics

515
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,360
share

516
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,360
yes harold thank you up

517
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,158
next slide please

518
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,840
okay i thought i would start off with a

519
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,080
quick introduction uh

520
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,120
so

521
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,880
haptics refers to the generation of

522
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,000
touch related

523
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,039
sensations it is used in a wide range of

524
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,880
consumer devices mobile devices

525
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,039
automobiles gaming

526
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,600
and haptic technologies requires some

527
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,679
kind of actuation to actually create the

528
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,480
tactile sensation in game controllers

529
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,400
and mobile devices that's

530
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,720
typically a small vibrating

531
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,200
motor of some kind the haptic actuator

532
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,280
in large automotive

533
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,200
touchscreens these

534
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,000
these are specialized piezo electric

535
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,200
materials

536
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
haptic capabilities are now

537
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,679
pretty commonplace in every modern

538
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,240
smartphone game vr controllers the

539
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,440
latest and the the best example is a

540
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,200
sony ps5 dual sense controller and

541
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,640
pretty much all of the late model

542
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,559
iphones and android types

543
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,360
and the version two of the

544
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,039
internet draft that

545
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,200
proposes haptics as a top-level media

546
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,559
type was uploaded in may of this year uh

547
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,360
next slide please

548
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,200
so what has happened since version two

549
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,120
was uploaded i thought it was important

550
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,840
to mention the latest developments in

551
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,960
that area

552
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,559
the uh iso based media

553
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,279
file format seventh edition which is

554
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,559
iso

555
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,720
14496

556
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,440
has been approved and is listed under

557
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,880
under publication

558
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,200
and it's a due out on the 3rd of

559
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,240
december

560
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,600
and this is

561
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,520
significant because it contains our

562
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,840
proposal that we made back in april of

563
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,679
2020 that specifies haptics as a top

564
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,840
level media track in an iso bmf file at

565
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,640
the same level as audio and video so

566
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,159
with this new standard the new mp4 files

567
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,039
once this standard is implemented will

568
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,600
have haptic tracks along with audio and

569
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,320
video tracks as well that calls that

570
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,440
that enables a more immersive uh media

571
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,000
experience

572
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,159
somewhat in other areas of mpeg we have

573
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,120
a the phase one cfp has been completed

574
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,520
four four four proponents uh provided

575
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,919
there that that their codex

576
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,240
three of them have been chosen as their

577
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
reference model zero and they are

578
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,320
progressing to the next stage of the

579
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,440
standardization and in mpegai which is a

580
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,240
immersive media portion of mpeg uh

581
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,880
haptic use cases and requirements we

582
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,360
have almost

583
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,000
20 you use cases and

584
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,400
over 25 new requirements

585
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,640
specifically pertaining to haptics they

586
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,240
have all been approved

587
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,279
by

588
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,720
by the mpeg

589
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,520
group and they are moving forward

590
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,919
uh can we can we go on to the next slide

591
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,240
please

592
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,640
uh so uh why are we asking for haptics

593
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,919
to be a top level media type

594
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,799
as i just mentioned the user experience

595
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,360
and enjoyment of media content can be

596
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,360
significantly enhanced by adding haptics

597
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,120
to audio video content in the iso bmf

598
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,679
files in media streams and streaming

599
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,480
games and mobile advertising and here i

600
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,880
want to respond to a question i got

601
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,919
already this morning and yes

602
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,559
haptics won't just be in files but they

603
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,600
will also be part of of rpp streams and

604
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,880
streaming games and wearable

605
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,919
devices

606
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,520
and xr applications is where we see

607
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,000
haptics being used in as part of rtp

608
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,039
streaming

609
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,080
and that and also the next success

610
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,720
section here talks about how

611
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,200
the the the mp4 files uh would

612
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,400
be would look like once the haptic stop

613
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,279
level type has been registered so haptic

614
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,159
slash mp4 would be mp4 files with just

615
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,400
haptic tracks in them and for the sake

616
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,440
of

617
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,880
consistency video mp4

618
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,760
would would stay video mp4 for files

619
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,000
which have the video audio and haptics

620
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,840
which each and shows

621
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,240
consistency with existing video mp4

622
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,799
files and the same goes for a audio

623
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,120
audio slash mp4

624
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,039
uh okay i can move on to the next slide

625
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,840
please

626
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,720
for the human sense of hearing we have

627
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,039
the top level media type called audio

628
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,039
for the human sense of seeing we have

629
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,520
the top level media type called video

630
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,600
for the equally important

631
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,240
and kind of the last link so to speak

632
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,799
for the human sense of touch we have it

633
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,279
makes perfect sense to have a top level

634
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,760
media type called haptics

635
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,399
placing haptics under audio or video or

636
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,640
application is not reflective of the

637
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,559
kinds of files or use cases that we

638
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,640
would like that would need haptics and

639
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,799
have nothing to do whatsoever with audio

640
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,120
or video or applications

641
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,679
move to the next slide please

642
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,559
uh

643
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,960
there are a number of sub

644
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,200
modalities of haptics a few of them are

645
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,240
already

646
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,039
in the process have found their way into

647
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,760
the empaga use cases and and and

648
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,080
requirements i mean you have vibro

649
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,159
tactile haptics which is the touch

650
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,919
vibration you have

651
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,520
kinesthetic you have

652
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,360
surface haptics you have

653
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,919
spatial non-contact haptics this is an

654
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,679
emerging field that that is gaining a

655
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,159
lot of traction in in different areas

656
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,960
called ultrasound haptics you have

657
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,320
thermal haptics uh and and so having

658
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,559
haptics as a top level media type would

659
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,480
enable the definition of the data

660
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,320
formats pertaining to these sub

661
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,360
modalities in a more streamlined manner

662
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,960
this is not going to be

663
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,520
possible if haptics were to be stuffed

664
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,480
under

665
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,799
an existing top level type like audio

666
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,799
video or application

667
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,240
can we move on to the next slide please

668
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,520
there are in a number of haptic data

669
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,919
formats already in use around the world

670
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,159
the most popular the most common of them

671
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,000
are ahap which is

672
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,720
uh

673
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,080
which basically

674
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,440
began life in ios devices but now there

675
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,600
are decoders available for android and

676
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,480
other xr systems there is the org

677
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,559
in android 11 google introduced a

678
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:10,640
proprietary extension to the rf format

679
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,960
specifically for haptic media and there

680
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,039
is the high ibs for

681
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,200
format which is used in a

682
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,159
number of mobile phones in asia from lg

683
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,440
and asus and then the hacked for format

684
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,080
has also found use among the number of

685
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,240
game developers around the world and uh

686
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,559
more importantly we

687
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,399
envision the following

688
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,600
standardized haptic coding for formats

689
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,720
that we expect expect to be registered

690
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,039
too soon and they would live as such a

691
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,080
subtypes under haptics one is the hmpeg

692
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,480
which which would be the outcome of the

693
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,399
impact call for proposals that i was

694
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,880
just talking about and h i

695
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,960
which is uh ieee p1918.1.1

696
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,520
coding standard that is currently under

697
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,640
ballot in ieee and will probably be out

698
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,960
much sooner than the hm tech

699
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,320
you can move on to the next slide please

700
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,200
so this is actually i think my last last

701
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,159
slide here uh we believe based on the

702
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,240
arguments i've made so far that haptics

703
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,000
doesn't really belong under any other

704
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,600
media type and the main reasons just to

705
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,159
reiterate haptics

706
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,320
connects to a sensory system touch

707
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,399
motion that directly and is more

708
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,240
specific than the abstract application

709
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,480
type application has historically been

710
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,960
used for applications that is code means

711
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,480
that is viewed and treated with great

712
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,760
care for security for viruses uh with

713
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,559
the and other active code haptics is not

714
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,399
code in much the same way audio and

715
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,640
video are not code either

716
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,039
haptics is a property of a media stream

717
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,559
it is not an application under any

718
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,880
normal definition as such we believe it

719
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,480
should be its own type

720
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,880
uh next slide i believe would be the

721
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,480
thank you and questions so

722
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,679
hi i i

723
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,440
seem to have backed the queue yeah i was

724
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,960
going to say the summary of the

725
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,679
discussion so far as i see it is that

726
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,399
one the use of top level names don't

727
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,200
give rise to any critical concern

728
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,640
that we need to be particularly

729
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,159
concerned about

730
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,600
and number two

731
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,320
if we file this new haptic stuff under a

732
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,200
new top level name it's going to be much

733
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,120
easier going forward for everybody

734
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,440
concerned because

735
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,200
this is not going to be the definitive

736
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,399
haptics

737
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,559
format

738
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,159
that's not going to be coming for quite

739
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,360
a while

740
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,519
putting them all under one umbrella is

741
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,519
going to help people navigate this space

742
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,600
so let's just do it that way

743
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,000
only but on the code thing

744
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,720
i have an image format that has code in

745
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,559
it

746
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,000
i send g-code to um

747
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,200
my cnc machines and that's moving around

748
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,158
so anyway

749
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,320
i guess i'm up just to

750
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
clarify what phil just said you said the

751
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
use of top level names

752
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,840
does not give rise to critical concerns

753
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,840
does that mean the creation of new ones

754
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,640
or

755
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,559
are you speaking retroactively that

756
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,159
we're fine with the way top level ones

757
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,440
have worked so far i just wanted to

758
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,080
clarify what you mean there

759
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,760
uh uh

760
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,600
basically i'm saying that

761
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,279
the discussion that we had the first

762
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,519
time was not it was saying

763
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,600
we didn't find any dragons

764
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,120
we don't need to

765
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,159
worry about breaking things by creating

766
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,279
a new top level domain here there's no

767
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,840
special magic

768
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,919
there's no special advantage there's no

769
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,880
special reason not to so let's do it

770
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,760
thanks that's what i want to clarify

771
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:11,489
[Applause]

772
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,200
harold if you are talking we couldn't

773
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,600
hear you

774
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,159
forgotten

775
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,200
no

776
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,200
the mp4 example was illustrative the

777
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,080
haptics will occur in files that

778
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,679
have previous definitions because

779
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:42,720
they're going to extend their

780
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,279
definitions to allow haptics

781
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,440
so

782
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,600
registration of those under haptics will

783
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,679
only have an advantage for

784
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:54,960
saying that

785
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,440
this is stuff that makes sense to

786
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,760
sense if you don't have audio or video

787
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,440
output but just

788
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,279
have haptics outputs

789
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,399
yeah

790
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,799
some choosing there jonathan

791
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,719
yeah so i guess uh two points john on

792
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,320
the general question of

793
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,239
you know whether i said this in the java

794
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,320
but i'll repeat it for the meeting you

795
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,918
know the question of

796
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,599
you know whether a new name is a concern

797
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,520
i'd say in a new name it's not a concern

798
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,040
for any types which would otherwise have

799
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
to go under application like this for

800
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,199
instance i mean i think as we found in

801
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,560
the chat there's some special cases for

802
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,480
existing top level types that are

803
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,320
special case but you know anything which

804
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,440
would otherwise have to be under

805
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,879
application would be in the grab bag

806
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,159
anyway so

807
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,480
a new device would say treat them as

808
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,599
unknown type

809
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,320
whether it's under application or under

810
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,639
a new top level type and that's fine so

811
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,599
i think

812
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,560
you know i'm not going to say a new

813
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,480
double type you know for but having a

814
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,839
new top-level type for a new kind of

815
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,760
multi-part would cause havoc having a

816
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,200
new top-level type for haptics is

817
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,599
absolutely fine um the other question i

818
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,160
had which is related to um

819
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,400
the issue that was just raised with mp4

820
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,280
is

821
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,920
there's kind of an implicit hierarchy

822
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,240
in that you know obviously many streams

823
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,560
many formats like mp4 contain more than

824
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,400
one type and so we have this rule that

825
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,560
if it only has audio it's audio if it

826
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,280
has audio and video it's video and so i

827
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,440
guess haptics have the same property

828
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,280
and so i guess

829
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,280
i think from what i read or remember of

830
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,119
your presentation last time haptics is

831
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,560
kind of the bottom of that hierarchy

832
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,640
which is to say if it's only haptics

833
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,400
it's haptics if it's haptics and audio

834
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,400
it's audio if it's happening on audio

835
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,079
it's in video it's video so is that

836
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,520
specified and i haven't read your

837
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,560
document right is that specified in your

838
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,839
in your in the document that would

839
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,160
register the top level type

840
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,160
you know yes i mean

841
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,520
just to

842
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,400
clarify the the reason we have it that

843
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,839
that way is because haptics is the

844
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,160
newest skill is the newest kid on the

845
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,240
block and we don't want to rock the boat

846
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,119
and so if it's all audio and haptics

847
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,560
then you probably

848
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,400
won't want to keep it as audio slash and

849
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,720
before but if it's haptics only then it

850
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,560
makes sense

851
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,000
but i mean i think this should be not

852
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,040
just because it's new but you know in 15

853
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,680
years when haptics is you know old hat

854
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,000
we're dividing a new container format we

855
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,200
probably still want to have this rule

856
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,359
that if it's haptics and audio you call

857
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,320
it audio yeah whereas if yeah so

858
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,640
and you know and then

859
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,000
so yeah i think you know we want we

860
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,599
probably explicitly call that out but

861
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,839
you know in this you know i'm not sure

862
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,079
the audio and video

863
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,359
was that explicitly called out in the

864
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,520
original definitions of the top level

865
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,920
types that audio and video is video or

866
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,200
would edit everybody to assume that was

867
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,160
the case

868
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,560
no i think it was

869
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,680
called

870
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,200
if i recall i mean if it's audio and

871
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,240
video then it gets video mp4 so

872
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,680
yeah yeah that's right that i mean i

873
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,200
think everybody knew it works that way

874
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,480
i'm just wondering how explicitly that

875
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,240
was said um so i think we want to

876
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,240
explicitly say that yes haptics is

877
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,920
it's you only put under haptics if it's

878
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,400
only haptics if it's a combined thing

879
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,440
you put it under the rules for the

880
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,040
combined thing i mean maybe you already

881
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,079
say that i'm afraid i haven't read your

882
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,560
draft and i apologize um

883
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,560
yeah so

884
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,320
yeah i think that question whether

885
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,800
that's the property of mp4 or it's a

886
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
property of uh

887
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,680
of the

888
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,160
the top-level domain hierarchy

889
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,760
that's an interesting question too and

890
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,880
maybe we

891
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,359
don't need i mean i guess

892
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,400
that's i i don't know

893
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,280
so that's

894
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,839
so that sounds like nobody sees an in a

895
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,440
big problem with this

896
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,599
also there's no

897
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,839
particular technical advantage or

898
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,160
disadvantage to

899
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,599
using haptics at the top level type

900
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,839
this

901
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,040
more or less all appearance

902
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,320
it looks better

903
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,320
dave

904
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,920
so i put this into chat um so i think in

905
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,520
one of jonathan's comments he talked

906
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,280
about you know maybe uh browsers from

907
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,960
middle boxes or whatever take image

908
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,640
formats and stick them into say image

909
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,920
tags and html and the more we see uh

910
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,160
haptics uh being included in standards

911
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,640
whether it's mpeg or other things um i

912
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,800
wonder if there's some chance that w3c

913
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
would start adding haptics tags like an

914
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,960
image tag and if so that's another

915
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,480
reason why there's an actual technical

916
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,160
benefit to having a haptics as a

917
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,079
top-level domain type if it helps

918
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,240
creation of dynamic html so just

919
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,440
wondering i don't know if that will ever

920
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,000
happen but it is a possible uh thing to

921
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,480
keep in mind

922
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,599
i'm sure there's some someone in

923
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,160
the wgc who are thinking about haptics

924
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,520
at the moment

925
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,920
but i haven't talked to them

926
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,599
yeah

927
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,160
actually harold if you go to slide

928
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,320
13 which is in the backup slides i

929
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,400
actually have a slide on the w3c

930
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,640
haptics work there you go

931
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,280
so the this is we

932
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,760
have added this as one of the

933
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,079
justification slides but we wanted to

934
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,839
have it in the in the backup in case

935
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,680
this kmark

936
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,079
right now they don't yet have

937
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,200
a well-defined haptic format and i think

938
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,520
they would benefit having haptics as a

939
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,200
top level type there as well

940
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,920
but they are working on a vibration api

941
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,839
for game pads i mean they have a

942
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,760
vibration extension for gamepads and

943
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,440
they have an api that's implemented on

944
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,880
chrome and firefox for android

945
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,920
okay mary

946
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,640
is is the plan to adopt this as a

947
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,160
working group document and process it

948
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,400
that way i can't remember i think

949
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,680
i can't remember exactly i wanted to

950
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,280
recap that

951
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,680
uh the planet the plan is to ask that

952
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,640
question

953
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,400
and the um right

954
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,240
yes

955
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,480
i'm sorry i'm jumping your your your

956
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,720
process i just wanted to the reason i

957
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,160
asked that is because that if we do that

958
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,760
then i want to make sure that wc3

959
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,520
comments on it before you know we

960
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,079
process it but that's it thanks

961
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,319
yep

962
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,520
of course all the all the

963
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,240
results of

964
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,440
all results of opinion polls on in the

965
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,920
room are going to be backed up with

966
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,520
asking the same same question on the

967
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,119
list and that will

968
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,280
also give time to consult the wgc

969
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,280
are we done with this topic now

970
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,359
i'm saving all the

971
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,400
the polls for the end

972
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,319
they're actually asking questions of

973
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:48,040
should we adopt this

974
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,520
i'm closing the queue and moving on

975
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,040
okay

976
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,599
the next plan

977
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,400
yep thank you

978
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,240
let me see

979
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,880
stop no that was not stop pleasure

980
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,440
share pre-order slides

981
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,480
and this is multiple suffixes

982
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,800
hey harold this is manu um

983
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,200
i have uh some updated slides i can

984
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,880
share them but it's fine we don't

985
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,880
necessarily need to i just captured your

986
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,119
questions in the new slide deck

987
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,680
yep you can present if you want to

988
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,359
and remember to send me the slides

989
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,040
afterwards so i can

990
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,000
or if you if you can i'm not sure how

991
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,119
this works

992
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,079
okay i think someone's got to give me

993
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,160
uh the ability to

994
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,560
scream there we go

995
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,160
there we go got it thank you

996
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,680
sorry i don't have a camera on my

997
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,240
workstation my apologies

998
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,880
static image only um

999
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,960
did you want to say a bit more or do you

1000
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,520
want me to just kind of jump

1001
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,200
all right so um

1002
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,880
this uh item is about multiple suffixes

1003
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,560
uh in media types uh just really quickly

1004
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,599
we're gonna

1005
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,359
look at the problem space

1006
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,200
talk about the current draft a bit

1007
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,400
there's some

1008
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,640
maybe pending concerns really that need

1009
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,800
to be discussed that harold sent out and

1010
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,119
mark weighed in on

1011
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,520
and then maybe some next steps i think

1012
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,200
folks should probably feel free to just

1013
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,200
ask questions as we go there only like

1014
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,440
five slides here

1015
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,319
um

1016
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,720
so real quick about the plot problem

1017
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,480
space um

1018
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,119
there's a question about how we should

1019
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,640
interpret

1020
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,880
media subtype names that contain more

1021
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,040
than one character so there are examples

1022
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,920
here at the bottom the top one is a real

1023
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,480
one that's being uh considered the

1024
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,359
bottom one is just kind of an attempt to

1025
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,440
uh you know suggest that

1026
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,280
it may apply to

1027
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,000
other existing formats um but really

1028
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,240
it's it's around

1029
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,280
you know what what do we mean uh with a

1030
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,200
structured suffix

1031
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,079
are structured suffixes allowed to have

1032
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,400
two plus signs if we do that

1033
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,040
what's the registration criteria

1034
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,040
uh do we even want to allow that uh

1035
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,680
things of that nature um

1036
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,480
this all came about because uh at least

1037
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,599
uh some of us in some w3c working groups

1038
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,240
tried to register something with two

1039
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,800
pluses in the name and the response was

1040
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,040
well there's not a clear

1041
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,560
there's not a clear decision on what

1042
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,319
that would mean so

1043
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,119
why don't we clarify what that means

1044
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,560
um

1045
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,400
all right so uh what are some of the

1046
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,640
options here um

1047
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,480
one of the options is that you know

1048
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,960
media sub tape subtypes are opaque

1049
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,359
they're defined by specification and you

1050
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,960
shouldn't read anything

1051
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,280
uh into it other than what's already

1052
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,440
written right

1053
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,000
so if you have two pluses in there maybe

1054
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,079
the spec needs to say it or maybe we

1055
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,680
should just not allow

1056
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,839
that at all

1057
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,079
another thing that we could say is media

1058
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,560
subtypes are structured but can only be

1059
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,359
one level deep i believe that's kind of

1060
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,280
sort of what's there today

1061
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,680
but of course defer to the experts on

1062
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,880
that

1063
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,480
and then finally

1064
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,319
you know media subtypes are structured

1065
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,280
they can be many levels and we need to

1066
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,319
clearly specify and define what it means

1067
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:33,520
to have

1068
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,440
you know kind of multiple

1069
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,240
levels there

1070
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,440
so

1071
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,359
right now the current draft so there's a

1072
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,920
draft out right that the

1073
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,079
w3c decentralized identifier working

1074
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,560
group put together it's a really quick

1075
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,119
one-pager pager that that kind of

1076
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,359
suggests one way that we could solve

1077
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,280
this uh issue

1078
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,560
um

1079
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,240
so if we just look at one of the

1080
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,319
examples here vc is a verifiable

1081
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,560
credential w3c

1082
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,079
uh you know wreck ld's linked data

1083
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,720
that's a bit hand wavy but there's um

1084
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,119
the assertion is that there is a

1085
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,280
specification that defines that data

1086
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,440
model and then plus json

1087
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,800
uh is a serialization

1088
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,480
of that so

1089
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,800
the one suggestion on the way that we

1090
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,680
could read this is if it has a plus json

1091
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,960
extension on it any media type

1092
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,359
it can be processed as json

1093
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,079
if it has a plus ld plus json which is a

1094
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,240
registered

1095
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,800
you know type as json ld it can be

1096
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,960
processed as json ld

1097
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,040
but you could also point a json

1098
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,440
processor and get something reasonable

1099
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,560
out of it

1100
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,839
if you pointed at that that media type

1101
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,000
um and then the final one is you know we

1102
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,720
have two plus signs um

1103
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,560
you know in here and that means that um

1104
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,160
you know it's a verifiable credentials

1105
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,079
data model expressed as a linked data

1106
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,800
data model which is more generic

1107
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,240
uh which is then serialized uh as json

1108
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,400
uh so the current draft basically says

1109
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,680
that's the way you interpret um multiple

1110
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,160
plus signs

1111
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,400
in a media type

1112
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,800
and of course their concerns around this

1113
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,599
of course right so

1114
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,560
one of the concerns here is that the

1115
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,880
w3c did working groups already shipping

1116
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,200
stuff with multiple plus signs it

1117
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,359
doesn't mean that we i mean we can go

1118
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:34,880
back and tell them stop doing that

1119
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,079
that's bad um do something else

1120
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,599
but right now there's software that's

1121
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,240
implemented nobody has screamed that

1122
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,640
it's anything's broken on them yet but

1123
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,200
clearly it doesn't have super broad

1124
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,560
deployment

1125
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,760
um

1126
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,680
harold asked the question on the mailing

1127
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,599
list you know is the order of the

1128
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,920
suffixes significant or meaningless um

1129
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,319
such that so for example

1130
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:03,119
you know vc plus ld plus json is does

1131
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,359
that the same thing as vc plus json plus

1132
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:06,400
ld

1133
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,440
um the current draft says the order has

1134
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,640
meaning

1135
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,240
so there's a very specific way you're

1136
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,640
supposed to interpret it uh the draft

1137
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,480
establishes um that you can't just

1138
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,119
mix and match suffixes they probably

1139
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,240
need to come in a certain order

1140
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,160
harold also raised the question of you

1141
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,400
know bar suffixes a bad idea and should

1142
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,160
we abandon them should they have no

1143
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,720
special meaning

1144
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,480
there's a question raised on whether or

1145
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,599
not that ship is already sailed

1146
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,200
meaning that we already have at least

1147
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,920
you know plus xml and plus json

1148
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,839
um but you know we could make the

1149
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,480
decision that well we're gonna stop

1150
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,640
there we're not gonna allow you know

1151
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,920
multiple

1152
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,640
um kind of nested suffixes

1153
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,920
um and of course there are other

1154
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,960
concerns like i'm sure chad has uh chat

1155
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,760
has raised a number of them um

1156
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,480
so

1157
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,240
this is kind of you know discussion the

1158
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,000
next slide is just kind of what are the

1159
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,160
next steps and harold i think you said

1160
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,079
you wanted to defer that to the end of

1161
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:09,200
the meeting

1162
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,079
um

1163
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,280
so why don't we use this time to kind of

1164
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,280
raise concerns is you know is anyone

1165
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,599
concerned with the current draft saying

1166
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:20,960
what it does

1167
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,359
um

1168
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,520
or any other you know concerns related

1169
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,319
to multiple suffixes

1170
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,599
or structured suffixes

1171
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,040
okay let's go to the queue

1172
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,359
dave

1173
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,160
so sorry i've not read the draft but i

1174
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,000
thought your explanation was great uh

1175
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,839
the second bullet of this slide confused

1176
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,920
me because what it says to me on the

1177
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,760
screen and what i heard in audio don't

1178
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,200
seem to match so i had a clarifying

1179
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,839
question um because i thought what you

1180
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,040
said was that the order does matter

1181
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,240
and what the slide says is the order the

1182
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,599
same if you switch them around the

1183
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,520
current draft says yes i'm sorry yes

1184
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,160
yeah that's that's confusing um

1185
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,720
the current draft says that

1186
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,000
order

1187
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,400
has meaning

1188
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,480
okay then um

1189
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,000
personally i

1190
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
like the direction that you're going i

1191
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,520
think that the order should be

1192
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,280
significant i think that the example

1193
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,559
that you showed on the screen of the

1194
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,079
three different interpretations of that

1195
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,480
one was a uh

1196
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,079
good example you don't have to go to it

1197
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,480
but i'm saying yeah that one um i tend

1198
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,880
to like that direction i don't see a

1199
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,359
problem with that if the order was uh

1200
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,440
not significant i would see problems

1201
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,640
with that right if you had an

1202
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,960
unrecognized one and trying to deal with

1203
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,559
all possible shufflings i think would

1204
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,319
just get too complex and i'm scared of

1205
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,640
that and so if order is significant than

1206
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,240
what you showed here

1207
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,400
um i may not be the expert on this but

1208
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,400
this looks reasonable to me so i think

1209
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,880
you're going in the right direction

1210
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,839
great thank you

1211
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,319
phil

1212
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,800
i like this i support uh working on it

1213
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,400
uh i i've come up with basically exactly

1214
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,400
the same uh

1215
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,520
issue

1216
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,400
with

1217
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,440
wrapping

1218
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,480
yeah i have json data structures

1219
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,520
i wrap them in a cryptographic envelope

1220
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,720
and that

1221
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,720
json data structure

1222
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,880
has a semantic

1223
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,319
uh i do take issue how i i agree agree

1224
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,359
that the order should be significant

1225
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,119
where i differ is

1226
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,720
i think that the media type should be um

1227
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,480
interpreted in the opposite order

1228
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,920
all right when i see that i see

1229
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,359
application i see it's a vc first so

1230
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,359
that's telling me that the semantic is

1231
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,520
vc

1232
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,720
the sub-semantic is ld

1233
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,559
and then within that

1234
00:50:58,559 --> 00:50:59,760
i've got

1235
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,480
it encoded in json so i'd use exactly

1236
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,359
the same um order

1237
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,520
but here's how it's mat it's going to

1238
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,480
matter

1239
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,640
when we are registering these things in

1240
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,960
the iana registry

1241
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,520
there's going to be a top level uh

1242
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,359
registration of

1243
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:20,480
application bc

1244
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,280
now the question is

1245
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,960
are you going to have a sub-registry

1246
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,000
of

1247
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,640
what the interpretations of the things

1248
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,800
that come after mean

1249
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,960
or are you going to have that controlled

1250
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,319
by application vc

1251
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,119
right if this becomes a thing

1252
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,480
in content media type world that means

1253
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,800
application slash bc

1254
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,079
star anything afterwards or rather

1255
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,040
application slash vc plus

1256
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,599
anything that follows has to be governed

1257
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,839
by a draft that

1258
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,000
talks about application is listed under

1259
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,640
application bc

1260
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,680
and

1261
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,800
so on

1262
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,960
it might be that you eventually come up

1263
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,280
with plus jason

1264
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,079
if you specify a plus jason it must mean

1265
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,640
the same thing across the whole itf

1266
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,960
because it would be ridiculous to have

1267
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,440
plus jason meaning it's in xml

1268
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,440
but you know maybe we don't need to uh

1269
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,200
write rules for that because people

1270
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,558
probably won't be that silly

1271
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,280
yeah i mean you you bring up a really

1272
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,760
good point philip i think one of the

1273
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,440
challenges here is that i don't think

1274
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,720
there is

1275
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,359
such a thing as application slash vc the

1276
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,520
vc it's it's um

1277
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,200
it's not it's kind of an abstract it is

1278
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,280
an abstract data model and you could

1279
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,359
argue that the linked data thing is an

1280
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:50,079
abstract data model as well it has no

1281
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:51,440
uh you know it it

1282
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,319
exists in kind of the math sense but it

1283
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:57,119
doesn't serialize until you shove it to

1284
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:58,160
json

1285
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,839
um and so i think there is concern there

1286
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,119
around

1287
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,680
vcs and abstract data data model ld is

1288
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,400
an abstract formally defined data model

1289
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,720
but it doesn't spring into existence

1290
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,440
until you serialize it to json or cbor

1291
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,000
or things of that nature and so i don't

1292
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,160
know how to actually

1293
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,359
address that concern right the the other

1294
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:22,480
thing that

1295
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,040
you know we're struggling with here is

1296
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,520
you know verifiable credentials is kind

1297
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,800
of a subset of a linked data

1298
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,920
um in a model so it feels that it's

1299
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,880
going

1300
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,880
more specific

1301
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,839
sorry um

1302
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,479
more so

1303
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,200
and then

1304
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,359
please speak shortly we have questions

1305
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:57,839
to ask

1306
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,440
okay mark

1307
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,000
there

1308
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,160
the little graph is moving okay

1309
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,400
um so

1310
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,119
if if i've been following the the

1311
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,200
jabber and i think

1312
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,880
we're kind of resolving to a place where

1313
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,599
we agree that you'd register

1314
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,720
you know jason or ld plus jason as a

1315
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,400
structured suffix type

1316
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,480
um and then that would allow someone to

1317
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,720
register immediate type of application

1318
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,040
you know vc plus ld plus json or

1319
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,640
whatever

1320
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,520
uh

1321
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,440
and if that's the case it makes me

1322
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,359
wonder if the only thing we really need

1323
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:38,799
to do here

1324
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,000
is

1325
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,079
to clarify that structured suffixes can

1326
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,799
include the plus character

1327
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:49,839
um just clarify that little point which

1328
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,760
the draft sorry the rfc i think is

1329
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,319
currently ambiguous amount

1330
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:56,319
and it is and my question is is that

1331
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:57,920
enough and i'd like to hear what people

1332
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,880
think you know if we just did that or or

1333
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,920
do we need to go into the potential

1334
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,200
swamp of

1335
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,559
what structured

1336
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,400
suffixes are and how you might process

1337
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,319
them and so forth and so on i'd be a

1338
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,720
little wary of doing that because

1339
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,400
i don't know where that's going to take

1340
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,559
us

1341
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,119
so

1342
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,720
we do have the question of uh does uh l

1343
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,799
plus ld plus jason need to obey the

1344
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,760
rules for plus jason

1345
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,319
anyway i think we have to ask our

1346
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,160
questions now

1347
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,319
let me see if

1348
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:37,359
i can get to

1349
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,359
to share

1350
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,558
share some slides again

1351
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,760
so i have three question slides

1352
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,599
one for each topic

1353
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,319
and i'm going to try to use the

1354
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,079
the tool for

1355
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,000
for them and the tool that seems to

1356
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,480
allow only only

1357
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:03,000
yes and no answers so well

1358
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,160
i'll just show you guys

1359
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,160
oh

1360
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,399
so

1361
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,720
we are 21 people so

1362
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,480
we'll see how many people want to want

1363
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,520
to state my opinion

1364
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:53,520
okay i think that's probably long enough

1365
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,440
and

1366
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,559
we've got

1367
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:58,960
a clear metroid is saying that yes we

1368
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,760
need need searcher

1369
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,079
search to proceed certain legislation

1370
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,920
check if i ask

1371
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,280
should we adopt the hectic draft

1372
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,559
i remind everyone that adoption as a

1373
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,079
working group document does not mean

1374
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,480
that we agree to everything that is any

1375
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,079
anything or everything that is in the

1376
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,559
document

1377
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,920
oops

1378
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,000
that was quick

1379
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,000
i think we have uh

1380
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,400
do you have

1381
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,680
what

1382
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,839
harold do you have the numbers for those

1383
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:57,280
i just realized i hadn't got

1384
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,040
yeah though so uh

1385
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,559
for the first one it was ten to two

1386
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,720
and then and the

1387
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,520
the second one was fourteen to one now

1388
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,160
fourteen to zero

1389
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,920
and the question three should we adopt

1390
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,640
the suffixes draft

1391
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,280

1394
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,480
a rough concert

1395
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,640
a rough consensus in that

1396
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,160
we got 10

1397
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,680
4 and 0 against

1398
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,799
so we have a series of

1399
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:03,359
ref consensus in the room

1400
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:04,799
and we'll take it to the mailing list

1401
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,440
for com for confirmation

1402
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,760
and if those hold up on the mailing

1403
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,720
lists

1404
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,640
