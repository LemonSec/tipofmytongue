68
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,760
we have one document in submitted to the

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,000
isg for publications

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,400
and moppex capabilities were submitted

71
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,519
recently

72
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,640
and their

73
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,560
work in progress

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,440
uh i we hope to that we can go to as

75
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,120
well at some point to work in group

76
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
class call from opex

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,200
and

78
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,159
then

79
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,080
we're going to as well discuss about

80
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,130
this failure detection of the router

81
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,360
[Music]

82
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,239
by contract and then as well there is a

83
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,840
new version of a storing root

84
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,400
so please review

85
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,120
and

86
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,760
consider to have it

87
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,560
as a work item in the working group we

88
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,640
have to discuss about that

89
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,120
and return to work because we understand

90
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,200
that the kobe situation

91
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,518
has

92
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,599
has

93
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,920
put some

94
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,560
difficulties to complete some work so we

95
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,200
are starting again to

96
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,840
get back to what we

97
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,680
left

98
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,959
um

99
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,159
okay

100
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,480
about the experience internet draft we

101
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,239
assume that those are going to be

102
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,400
continued later

103
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,360
the information these modifications

104
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,840
about young and multicut spear

105
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,680
so this is our marston that were

106
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,920
achieved that are done

107
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,000
basically the through our

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,319
rfc

109
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,759
so about the current milestones um

110
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,199
okay about the first item we have to

111
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,120
we have to update the date

112
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,680
and we still have work on done so this

113
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,600
they have to be updated

114
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,320
for the second one uh we

115
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,080
we have split in two

116
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,639
working items uh two documents opex and

117
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,080
capabilities

118
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,159
so as well they have to be updated

119
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,440
i don't know so yeah yeah what what the

120
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,520
offers think would be

121
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,360
an appropriate date for

122
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,520
submission of mobax

123
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,360
on the one hand and

124
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,759
capabilities on the other hand

125
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,040
i think that's

126
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,280
maybe rubble or

127
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,000
the co-office

128
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,840
so

129
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,080
with regards to mopex and capabilities i

130
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,000
think for mopex there is just one action

131
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,520
item which is open

132
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,400
it's uh already shared on the issue list

133
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,440
in the

134
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,919
in the github repo that we have

135
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,680
the role working group

136
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,400
but apart from that there are no other

137
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,560
pending items so to speak

138
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,520
we would really love to have

139
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,560
some

140
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,400
targeted review stores this documentary

141
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,960
already dominated this review based on

142
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,400
which is the last update

143
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,840
okay

144
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,960
so um do you mean you could work on it

145
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,360
in the next few months but

146
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,120
as we're going to update the milestones

147
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,199
we don't want to do that every month you

148
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,600
know in pushing things

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,440
further and further so what would be a

150
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,120
reasonable milestone for that according

151
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,180
to you

152
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,199
[Music]

153
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,280
x is an easier one to handle the

154
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,039
capability is maybe we can take it up

155
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,479
later

156
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,160
i would say even though there is one

157
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,000
single work item uh but that's a call

158
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,440
that i working with that that our

159
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,680
working group should be taking i i'll

160
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,080
maybe float that question on the voting

161
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,759
group again romney gave already raised

162
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,759
that in the email i guess but we are yet

163
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,600
to receive any response

164
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,639
but

165
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,080
i would say

166
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,639
design-wise complexity-wise mopex is

167
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,360
much lesser complex than capabilities so

168
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,080
i would say that

169
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,120
okay thank you

170
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,319
okay thank you sorry which months

171
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,000
i could not understand

172
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
yes

173
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,919
uh the months well i didn't say uh

174
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,759
okay you're coming in quite quite low

175
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,560
around actually if you can increase

176
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,479
your mic level or speed close that's

177
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,919
like compared to the others

178
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,919
how is it now sorry i'm sorry that's

179
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,360
what i wanted to say as well because i'm

180
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,960
trying to take notes but i really cannot

181
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,840
hear what harley said

182
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,880
how is it now sorry

183
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,360
it's better better still a bit weak but

184
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,599
but better

185
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,960
let me just repeat what i said there was

186
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,800
one uh one open question on the mopex

187
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,360
that we have in the issue in the work

188
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,479
working group repo github repo

189
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,360
that is the only open action item

190
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,039
that the working groups needs to take a

191
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,000
call on

192
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,120
with that done mopex is fairly a simple

193
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,080
designs badly a simple

194
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,919
document because it does not introduce

195
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,639
much uh any new messages on the other

196
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,520
hand

197
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,680
capabilities document introduces new

198
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
messages so it might take a little bit

199
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,960
more longer

200
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,199
uh and as i would say that we can we can

201
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,639
handle more effects first and keep

202
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,840
capabilities for later

203
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,979
[Music]

204
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,720
is our current priority

205
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,640
uh we need that we are going to have to

206
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,479
review more

207
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,440
from michael and addy

208
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,360
and then i think we are ready for

209
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,120
working on glasgow

210
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,450
um

211
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,640
[Music]

212
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,760
yeah

213
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,880
uh peter is here

214
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,279
no i don't think so we have to take this

215
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,920
with discussion with the author

216
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,880
and enrollment priority

217
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,920
we need one review more so we

218
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,760
suggest march

219
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,560
next year

220
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,399
these modifications

221
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,519
the meaning

222
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,240
do you have some

223
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,480
november yeah

224
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,040
yeah that's probably going to be in the

225
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,640
end of next year

226
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,839
um

227
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,680
i need to resume work that's going to

228
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,640
happen in the spring then or the usual

229
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,640
delays you know before submission

230
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,920
okay

231
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,440
great thank you

232
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,720
and then

233
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,160
multicast

234
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,399
would be uh this is a between is a work

235
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,040
that will happen between pascal and

236
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,839
carsten so we can

237
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,560
ask them by email or if they want to

238
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,040
comment here

239
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
not moving on with this one

240
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,040
and

241
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,800
so this one's recasting but but the

242
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,959
multicast work that we've started so far

243
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,080
is told

244
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,399
uh we need to to get more interest on

245
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,160
here etc

246
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,720
for now okay no this is this is not the

247
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,920
focus

248
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,880
okay

249
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,839
great thank you let us know

250
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,839
okay um

251
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,440
okay we have open tickets like uh here

252
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,240
so

253
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,680
please they are outdoors check your

254
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,240
tickets if you consider your

255
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,079
a document close to working with last

256
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,920
call share your tickets and close them

257
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,120
if they are sold or updated accordingly

258
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,200
thank you

259
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,360
we have the two system the report and

260
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,120
the track

261
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,440
from the idea from the github we will

262
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,399
try

263
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,440
we aim to move to cheetah but still we

264
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,399
we keep both

265
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,040
okay next topic it's uh of the variable

266
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
so we are currently

267
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,519
in version 11 we are

268
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,200
working in the discuss

269
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,000
discuss

270
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,200
comments from the ist

271
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,920
but as well we want to bring here

272
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
the conversations about the mode of

273
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,720
operations and if this document should

274
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,160
obsolete

275
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,399
the 6997

276
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,720
so to give a background

277
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,760
we have in the current document the mod

278
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,120
operation

279
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,720
five

280
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,200
so in here we have two options

281
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,360
we continue with the mode of operation

282
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,640
five

283
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,399
but we have a

284
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,440
available only two six and five

285
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,880
so

286
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,640
it's going to

287
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,959
keep

288
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,920
one left but if this non-story

289
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,880
mode multicast u6 they're not going to

290
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,600
be

291
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,240
nothing left for future work

292
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,880
the other option is to use the one from

293
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,440
the draft 6997 operation 4.

294
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,320
this document this draft this rfc is

295
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,120
experimental p2p ripple

296
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,040
is we are not aware of the

297
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,120
implementation

298
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,920
so

299
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,800
as far as we know is not widely

300
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,880
implemented we know that exists

301
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,800
unimplementation in riot operating

302
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,240
system

303
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,480
but we have not got any comments into

304
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,079
the main list

305
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,680
so please if you are aware of some

306
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,480
deployments let us know incrementation

307
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,600
let us know by the main list

308
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,920
the other question if

309
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,519
this

310
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,240
a draft audio variable should obsolete

311
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,600
p2p ripple

312
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,040
and if we go forward with this option we

313
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,959
should clarify

314
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,839
that both implementations cannot coexist

315
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,680
on the same network

316
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,480
right

317
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,720
and what happened i mean if

318
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
they overlapped

319
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,680
so

320
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,600
we want to know the discussion and the

321
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
opinion of the working group on this

322
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,000
matter

323
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,079
and

324
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,319
yes

325
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,959
overlapping is a big world because to to

326
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,959
get two nodes to talk together you need

327
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,040
to voluntarily give them you know the

328
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,360
network keys so they can see each other

329
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,680
i mean it does not happen by mistake or

330
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,440
by magic you know all those networks are

331
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,000
secured but layer two so

332
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,399
um really it would be very very

333
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,560
surprising that someone

334
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,079
uh comes in and deploys nodes with two

335
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,240
different protocols on the same networks

336
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,440
and

337
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,839
so it really will not happen we have to

338
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:38,880
explicitly

339
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,639
explicitly say

340
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,839
that it's not compatible with

341
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,000
6997 and that you know

342
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,440
they should not be deployed in the same

343
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
network but really it will not happen by

344
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,360
mistake and people have to have to

345
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,680
configure keys but

346
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,360
just there's no magic it's not just

347
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,480
because they are in the same place

348
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,240
thank you very much

349
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,800
what do you think about obsoleting b2p

350
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,040
6997

351
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,360
i'm fine with obsoleting the reason is

352
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,639
uh as you said there is no

353
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,519
non-deployment uh and

354
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,360
uh having two options would divide the

355
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,120
market quote-unquote

356
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,000
so if if people decide to

357
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,600
to go for a reactive protocol i think

358
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,959
it's good that they have one clear

359
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,399
option and not to choose between two

360
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,519
and did 6997 was experimental now we are

361
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,880
doing a standard track that's exactly

362
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,360
what we mean

363
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,399
yeah yeah

364
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,160
okay yes uh

365
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,320
based on understanding all the use cases

366
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,959
that are applicable to p to p can be

367
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,560
fulfilled with odp ripple so

368
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,760
there is no

369
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,120
a specific use case that should need p2p

370
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,079
and can and not be possible

371
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,399
yes alvaro

372
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,519
so

373
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,440
we had um

374
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,519
i had asked the same question when

375
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,760
this draft first came to me

376
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,480
about obsoleting um

377
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,560
p2p

378
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,800
there is one of the

379
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,399
applicability

380
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,079
rc's

381
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,320
that i think

382
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,600
recommends using p2p

383
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,120
um you know i think there's a should

384
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,040
there use b2b or something like that or

385
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,800
maybe it's a must i forget

386
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
um

387
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,160
we're going to go that way we're going

388
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,519
to need to

389
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,160
update that right so that

390
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,360
um and i understand there are no

391
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,800
implementations but yeah we need to just

392
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,279
update that so there's no pointing to

393
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,160
something that doesn't exist anymore

394
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,680
i need to remember if there are parts

395
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,120
of

396
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,399
aodv

397
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,240
that point at procedures in p2p

398
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,399
because you know it uses some

399
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,600
not exactly the same thing but you know

400
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,639
there are some things that are similar

401
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,399
if that is the case then we need to

402
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,560
specify them in the draft right because

403
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,920
if we're going to obsolete the other one

404
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,600
we can't refer to an obsolete document

405
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,519
so if we're going to do that then we

406
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,920
need to do a little bit more

407
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,880
um

408
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,680
work i mean i'm not opposed to it i just

409
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,600
you know we just need to to be a little

410
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,880
bit more

411
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,639
careful in

412
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,600
in what we're doing there

413
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,720
thank you

414
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,880
it's my building and it's the building

415
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,600
and home rfc

416
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,240
87733 that talks about p2p i was pretty

417
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,120
sure and then i looked and i'm right um

418
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,720
and

419
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,199
um i think we can relatively safely say

420
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,199
that i don't think that it's it's been

421
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,199
implemented or deployed in any

422
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,199
significant amount or even any

423
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,959
insignificant amount

424
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,880
um but i understand what you're saying

425
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,320
uh we we need to kind of uh uh

426
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,440
tell people if they are going to

427
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,639
implement it

428
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,199
uh how they would do it with aodv

429
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,959
instead i think that's what your point

430
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,480
is is that right

431
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
yeah

432
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,640
right and um

433
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,959
right so i'm not sure if

434
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,039
or i was hoping that

435
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,079
that the update to that uh applicability

436
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,679
statement would just be like a one line

437
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,280
thing of instead of using p2p usa or aot

438
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,720
i don't know if there are other parts of

439
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,400
the profile that we would need to change

440
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,439
there

441
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,520
but yes we just need to go that sounds

442
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,160
like a good thing it would say update

443
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,720
7733

444
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,799
and then say something else about this

445
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,080
yeah

446
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,520
right right it may just be a one

447
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,840
sentence thing it may be more i'm hoping

448
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,919
just one sentence right

449
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,799
yeah 7733 just says these are the right

450
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,160
parameters and so you need to give the

451
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,640
other parameters for aodv doesn't say

452
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,960
anything about really how you use it

453
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,039
it's not really yeah well okay

454
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,240
so it sounds like we just need a

455
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,160
paragraph or so that sounds enough

456
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,160
yes

457
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,039
so it seems we need to do some homework

458
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,880
if we go that route

459
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,760
and

460
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,320
see what the

461
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,880
easier stuff

462
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,120
obsoleting would be nice if it's not too

463
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,039
costly in terms of

464
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,799
uh process

465
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,120
um so who's willing to

466
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,840
examine that

467
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,480
uh i'll take a look at that next week

468
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
and see what i can do

469
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,760
great thank you

470
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,840
so it would have been nice if uh

471
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
charlie or someone would have been here

472
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,440
i don't know if any of the other authors

473
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,720
are here or not

474
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,840
um

475
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,240
conflicts

476
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,840
the other part of this is that this

477
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,200
document

478
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,840
already went through iesg review yeah i

479
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,440
mean it's sitting there right with a

480
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,280
couple of discusses

481
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,880
um

482
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,200
i i need to think about this because we

483
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,320
might

484
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,799
need to pull it back

485
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,760
and um

486
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,360
you know pull it back from the

487
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,960
asg queue and send it back to the

488
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,160
working group

489
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,320
uh because it may be a more significant

490
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
change i hate doing that because i mean

491
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,440
this

492
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,960
document already left the working group

493
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,480
like two years ago

494
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,320
um but it's just been slow uh

495
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,400
on getting provisions and right but

496
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,520
apart from

497
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,640
saying it would just use mob number four

498
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,520
uh how would that document audv ripple

499
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,160
be affected

500
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
it would trigger

501
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,160
uh well map number four then we're also

502
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,240
leading p2p and

503
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,559
updating

504
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,200
well yes it was because now it would be

505
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,280
obsolete other things and changing other

506
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,840
stuff

507
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,240
so i guess what i want to see is

508
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,200
probably what the scope of the changes

509
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
before i guess i make a decision whether

510
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,039
we need to pull it back or not because

511
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,520
um since we're in the middle of the asg

512
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,240
review right i want to just pull it

513
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,880
under people's feet right and

514
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,039
maybe all we do is

515
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,039
ask them to to consider it again or

516
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,159
something without having to run through

517
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,840
the whole last call process and

518
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,440
everything else

519
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,280
but let's look at the at the scope of

520
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,799
the changes

521
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,640
um okay

522
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,679
and then we can figure that out

523
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,760
actually in this view okay you haven't

524
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,320
gone through the last slide on this

525
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,640
and maybe

526
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,240
diogenes has now understood we're

527
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,720
leaning forward toward

528
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,080
going to mode4 for aud report

529
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,200
and

530
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,799
and so we

531
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,640
we asked the question on mailing list we

532
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,200
got a few answers not many

533
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,360
but most of them were in favor of

534
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,280
reusing mob4 i think mostly

535
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,760
the working group members are conscious

536
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,880
of the few more values left

537
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
until we have no packs

538
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,000
and

539
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,200
so this is the occasion if somebody

540
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,400
strongly objects to using four

541
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,960
and as alvaro said

542
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,280
if we agree that move four is the way

543
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,840
where we want to go we'll investigate

544
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,440
exactly how much

545
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,200
work is involved and

546
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,960
what the process is for your db report

547
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,720
okay

548
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,640
we will create an issue to track all

549
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,240
these and we can

550
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,559
we can specify for example with

551
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,440
documents referenced to 69.97

552
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,960
so we know

553
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,360
how much this document is affect the

554
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,679
other other documents

555
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:48,480
okay

556
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,240
yes

557
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,720
okay i'm hearing no strong objection

558
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,039
right now

559
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,559
issue last

560
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,120
warning on the mailing list and and do

561
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,640
the homework

562
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,360
to investigate exactly what is involved

563
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,159
by

564
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,200
reusing them up for

565
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,280
okay very good thank you okay

566
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,440
great thank you

567
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,600
okay good so we have three minutes more

568
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,600
pascal do you want to go with multicast

569
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,440
okay um well this basically let me

570
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,760
introduce this it's a fairly recent

571
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,799
draft

572
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,840
that was published let me share video

573
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,240
maybe

574
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,840
okay uh so this is this is a fairly

575
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,320
recent draft that was uh proposed at six

576
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,760
low but really

577
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,080
it is both a six low other raw work

578
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,039
uh because it does basically what eight

579
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,840
five or five which is six floor fc does

580
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,880
for nd but at the same time it does what

581
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,840
uh

582
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,039
nine zero

583
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,919
one zero eight ninety eighty ninety ten

584
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,720
i'm sorry that's for uh ripple remember

585
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,960
that's the ripple underwear leaf so in

586
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,880
the case of the two existing documents

587
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,919
it's about

588
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,720
using uh six lap and nd to register an

589
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,400
ipv6 address

590
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,640
and uh so that's h505 and using ripple

591
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,159
um to basically report that extra

592
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,159
knowledge rise to the root using

593
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,480
non-stone story mode

594
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,240
here which we are doing

595
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,360
is we are extending 8505

596
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,799
for multicast and any cast address

597
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,000
and at the same time we are providing

598
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,159
the operation in ripple

599
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,120
to transport those addresses

600
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,120
so there was a ripple multicast support

601
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,200
for storing mode

602
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,039
there was nothing for non-storing and

603
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,039
casting was really asking for something

604
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,480
to happen there

605
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,320
you know there was nothing for any guest

606
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,279
anyway

607
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,080
so next slide please

608
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,840
so that's the brief intro

609
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,799
okay so so basically just for for the

610
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,720
sake of memory here is that the family

611
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,600
of rfcs which come with uh

612
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,520
six open d started with 6775 which was

613
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,559
extended and partly replaced

614
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,120
uh by h505 so with this you can

615
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,559
basically uh

616
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,679
register using a unicast exchange an

617
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:28,880
address

618
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,640
to your router

619
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,000
and that has the good capability with

620
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,320
h505 to

621
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,640
abstract whatever routine happens in the

622
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,960
network in our case it's ripple

623
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,000
but uh it could be meeple it could be a

624
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,640
neighbor discovery proxy

625
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,559
and that's what rfc8929 does um there's

626
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,919
also evpn there's a draft at the vpn for

627
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,919
injecting

628
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:56,960
address

629
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,320
my ip address slash mac addresses as a

630
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,279
rapid type 5 in vpn

631
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,559
um

632
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,679
and

633
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,279
there is rift as well so there are many

634
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,520
environments where we can actually

635
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,080
learn from this abstract

636
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,600
agnostic interface which address exists

637
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,880
on the network and what their mac

638
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,760
address is and inject that in whatever

639
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,679
backend being be it ripple rift

640
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,919
evpn etc

641
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,960
but that was only for unicast so there

642
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,880
are two things which are uh happening

643
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,159
right now

644
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,279
uh at six low one is to

645
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,279
extend the support of this of the 6lbr

646
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,760
so it can be used as a

647
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,080
registrar that you can look up

648
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,559
when you have to to find an address

649
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,720
mapping instead of sending in the next

650
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,200
lookup as a multicast broadcast message

651
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,880
you can actually effectively do that as

652
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,559
unique as so that's one piece of work

653
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,320
which is happening

654
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,799
but for our interest here the the most

655
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,039
important thing is there is this six

656
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,039
little multicast registration that i'm

657
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,679
discussing today

658
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,400
next slide please

659
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,440
so why did we create it and why did we

660
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,000
go through swiftly well there is there

661
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,720
is an external sdo called the weiss and

662
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,919
alliance

663
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,279
that uh defines in the fan working group

664
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,279
field area network working group

665
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,919
define how ripple six slope and extra

666
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,520
are being used

667
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,600
for ysl applications that's 15 4g

668
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,360
typically for metering applications

669
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,679
and so far they were using unicast but

670
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,520
they started noticing the need for

671
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,799
multicast

672
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,880
and for that they wondered how to

673
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,640
achieve it and realize that implementing

674
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,679
mld

675
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,000
would would be very hard for their very

676
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,919
constrained devices on the one hand and

677
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,039
requires to to listen to multicast

678
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,039
and the the low power

679
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,440
battery operated devices are not

680
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,000
friendly to broadcast in in any fashion

681
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,679
that's why we did apparently in the

682
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,919
first place but the same need appeared

683
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,440
for for

684
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,919
the suggestion suggestion was oh this

685
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,600
device is already 285 why don't they uh

686
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,760
use 855 as well

687
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,440
to basically indicate that they are

688
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,399
listeners to to a multicast address or

689
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,679
that they share in any cast address and

690
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,360
for the front from the perspective of

691
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,240
the 6lowpan device 6ln that's pretty

692
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,039
much

693
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,200
the same effort whether it's unicast any

694
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,960
caster multicast you just have to say

695
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,159
hey i can accept a packet coming to that

696
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,480
address although in hand and they need

697
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,120
to signal in h505 you know it's unique

698
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,679
as any cast or multicast to just to be

699
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,520
very clear that they know about it

700
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,200
and because any cast are not

701
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,760
distinguishable from unicast so you

702
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,399
really have to sign it

703
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,080
a multicast is different it always

704
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,840
starts with foxbox you know so it could

705
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,760
be infer than it was actually so far in

706
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,399
repo in felt from from the address but

707
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,640
with this draft we're effectively asking

708
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,720
that the flags which say anycast and

709
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,360
multicast are propagated in ripples so

710
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,240
the

711
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
the writing protocol is very clear what

712
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,240
type of address and what phrase expected

713
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,960
the 6r has a little bit more work to do

714
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,760
because compared to the unicast it has

715
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,760
to accept more than one registration for

716
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
the same address

717
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,159
but with different rovers so basically

718
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,840
the tuple that identifies the

719
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,600
registration becomes address comma rover

720
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,240
and remember the rover is what initially

721
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,679
was the ui 64. that's the unique id

722
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,520
of the device that can be actually

723
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,440
proven using rfc89

724
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,240
so

725
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,720
this draft also extends

726
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
in under our leaves

727
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,960
because now we can next inject any cast

728
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,360
and multicast addresses in ripple so the

729
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,520
same type of mapping there is what comes

730
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,240
in

731
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,039
uh 8545 here is what goes out repo on

732
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,480
the other way

733
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,200
around it's pretty much the same i mean

734
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,640
there's very little difference the

735
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,919
differences in the ripple behavior

736
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,120
and so we extend 65 50 to express that

737
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,440
behavior and that's when the discussion

738
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,159
on map4 came into play because if

739
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,919
if um

740
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,520
aodv takes mode 5 it means that for this

741
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,679
draft we would be asking

742
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:22,960
map 6

743
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,520
for the non-starring multicast support

744
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,360
and that would mean taking the very last

745
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,039
map available

746
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,919
so so we said a uh since four is not

747
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,120
reused

748
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,600
uh maybe better take the path of of

749
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,399
leaving six alone and using five here

750
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,480
and four for iodp repo that's really

751
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,799
where i started

752
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,000
so same thing as the the arrow option in

753
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,600
h505 we have two new uh flags

754
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,440
and this time they are in the report

755
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,840
target

756
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,120
option and

757
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,679
because anycast was not present in map 3

758
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,320
we also describe how any cast works so

759
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,679
any cast

760
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,159
in terms of ripple process procedure is

761
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,240
really like multicast

762
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
like you have to accept and remember

763
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,120
keep track of more than one origin

764
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,520
but uh in the case of any cast when you

765
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,679
have a packet you just forward it to one

766
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:16,640
of them

767
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,480
whereas with multicast you forward to

768
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,840
all your children in storyboard

769
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,559
multicast next slide please

770
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,960
okay and the big thing to for this group

771
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,960
i guess is that we we introduced the new

772
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,640
non-starring multicast mode of operation

773
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,880
and so this slide basically

774
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,880
discusses what that map does

775
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,120
um

776
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,080
so

777
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,279
if the the six sellers at the edge

778
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,000
which have six ln

779
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,080
children attached to them

780
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,240
which register for multicast or any cast

781
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,720
address setting the flags in the error

782
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,760
will propagate that registration if you

783
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,240
know us in a five the flag is set to say

784
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,200
please

785
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,880
do the routing for me

786
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,760
so

787
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,720
if a flag is set 6lr will inject the

788
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,840
address using a target option with the

789
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,559
appropriate flag set

790
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,600
so in non-stopping mode um that that's

791
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,840
going to be a unicast by get to the root

792
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,519
just just like

793
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,000
for a row a ripple no leaf

794
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,600
and

795
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,080
what happens now because if it's it's

796
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,559
multicast in the case of multicast the

797
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,240
route will do what we call ingress

798
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,159
replication meaning that

799
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,200
it will send a packet a copy of the

800
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,519
multicast packet to each of the six

801
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,640
sellers

802
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,120
that have sent down

803
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,279
so each of the six alarms that have at

804
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,000
least one child which registered to a

805
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,240
multicast address for multicast string

806
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,919
really um

807
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,760
will receive a copy and the copy will be

808
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,919
tunneled exactly like

809
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,840
for an external route so it's going to

810
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,960
be a

811
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,840
just an srh to the 6r

812
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,399
6lr the encapsulates the packet

813
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,039
and the exception the capsulated packet

814
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,120
instead of being unicast

815
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,640
in as usual

816
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,200
this time becomes a multicast is a

817
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,600
multicast packet but for forwarding down

818
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,880
the deal dag it didn't make any

819
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,559
difference it was just a tunnel packet

820
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,399
to the 6r

821
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,919
so the the route sends a one to six slr

822
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,039
and and each cxlr uh looks you know the

823
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,559
destination

824
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,039
and copies all the six elements that

825
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,240
subscribed

826
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,760
and note that in the mailing list we

827
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,600
discussed how to call this and we we

828
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,720
agreed to call it subscription so um

829
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,120
really the 6000 subscribe to to

830
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,679
multicast address when they register

831
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,240
uh to to an unicast or on any cast

832
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,840
address

833
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,960
just for terminology

834
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,399
because the multicast address does not

835
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,320
belong to the device

836
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,039
uh where your unicast or even any cast

837
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,480
belongs

838
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,399
um

839
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,880
the and then there is also obviously

840
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,440
this support for any cast and for the

841
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,519
support of any cast well the root will

842
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,679
just choose one of the six at all and

843
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,559
and send the packet to him

844
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,039
so it's it's again uh the same unicast

845
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,360
tunnel as usual and inside there is a

846
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,399
packet which is an anycast package and

847
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,919
so the cxlr will look for uh any of the

848
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,240
devices that register to it and pick

849
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,120
what

850
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,880
so it really looks like the support of

851
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,840
unicast you just pick one and send uh

852
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,480
the only little thing is is uh if the

853
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,919
layer 2x

854
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,399
uh indicate that the 600 does not

855
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,480
receive the packet the 6r is still free

856
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,000
to pick another

857
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,159
6lm that registered for the unicast

858
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,320
address and pass the packet to him so

859
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,399
after a few weeks the nodria stream is

860
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,519
free to decide for for alternate 67

861
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,000
next slide

862
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,880
and that's pretty much what is being

863
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,279
said in more detail here so as opposed

864
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,640
to multicast

865
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,480
in any cast address looks like a unicast

866
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,760
address so we we effectively needed a

867
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,960
flag

868
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,918
uh to to signal in ripple and in nd that

869
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,839
this is any cast

870
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,760
now there is always the question of the

871
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,639
backward compatibility for both cases so

872
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,359
uh basically in the case of multicast as

873
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,760
soon as you see uh foxfox in the address

874
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,040
you assume multicast anyway finally cast

875
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,280
uh the process the proceeding will be as

876
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,639
unicast

877
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,320
until there is a command parent

878
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,000
somewhere

879
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,839
in the case of story mode that or the

880
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,079
root in case of non-story mode that sees

881
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,918
multiple registrations

882
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,159
so if the common parent or the root sees

883
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,560
multiple registrations for an address if

884
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,119
none of them has the flag for ready cast

885
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,879
it will just keep wrong

886
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,000
and you know the tid rule will apply etc

887
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,400
and it will reject the the others as

888
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,640
duplicate

889
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,400
but if

890
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,599
uh one of them bears the any gas flag

891
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,119
it is to understood that all the

892
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,599
registrations are for any cast and then

893
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,160
it will remember them all

894
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,920
note that for any case the tid is

895
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,200
irrelevant

896
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,040
because

897
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,720
multiple nodes can originate

898
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,839
advertisement it is relevant

899
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,000
within the scope of one rover but

900
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,480
the rover is is not propagated when

901
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,720
there are multiple registrations for the

902
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,320
same address

903
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,160
for instance the first the 6lr which

904
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,200
receives

905
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,680
uh three registrations for three six

906
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,040
elements which one to be sent to the

907
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,200
same anycast and that's three different

908
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,440
rovers and that cannot be circulated

909
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,880
inside ripple

910
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,280
so so the use of rover is is not the

911
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,440
same and the use of tid is not the same

912
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,040
basically those things won't work for

913
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,079
any guest they're multicast

914
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,720
what did you say

915
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,640
oh yes the important one is there is no

916
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,200
instruction right now in the document

917
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,720
uh about

918
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
in the case of any cast

919
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,280
how a node will decide which

920
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,599
child or the root which decide which

921
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,880
cxlr

922
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,200
um is there some stickiness based on the

923
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,720
flow is there you know pure round robin

924
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,279
pure random that's that's not discussed

925
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,359
but what's discussed is you know a node

926
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,839
cannot source within any cast or

927
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,920
multicast address which is just ipv6

928
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,200
architecture

929
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,680
next line

930
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,320
so last but not least we have uh

931
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,880
backward compatibility uh considerations

932
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,880
because uh repo is already widely

933
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,280
deployed in particular for white sun and

934
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,440
it's always deployed with map one

935
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,680
so if we wanted to do this as an

936
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,440
addition to an existing network we have

937
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,400
to do two things we have to to explain

938
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,240
how it works in map one and then we say

939
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,000
yes it can work

940
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,520
but we have to

941
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,800
to uh basically tell the nodes uh

942
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,400
that that they have to support it

943
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,760
because it's not report which will

944
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,599
signal report will see number one as

945
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,680
opposed to about five

946
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,480
next slide please

947
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,200
and so where we we

948
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,760
this the document was adapted there's

949
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,520
great progress in there it's getting

950
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,640
stable

951
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,800
um we have to

952
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,880
i would say finish it on the sixth low

953
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,960
list but would really appreciate

954
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,440
comments from rip from the raw mailing

955
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,320
list

956
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,680
cc6 low and then we we started

957
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,400
discussing with uh the 80s about you

958
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,599
know how we

959
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,599
we do this interaction between raw and

960
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,760
and ripple so that's working progress

961
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,920
but eric client should talk to alvaro

962
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,880
and eric also suggested talking to

963
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,240
pm people

964
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,079
to see exactly what kind of intersection

965
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,920
we have there

966
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,560
and i'm done

967
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,320
hi uh yeah so just to make sure you just

968
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,280
sit there

969
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,400
um

970
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,000
to make sure i understand uh

971
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,560
you're basically

972
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,320
eliminating the need to do mld

973
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,079
yeah pretty much i mean so so it was

974
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,839
done in two steps because

975
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,480
traditional nd requires mld

976
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,880
for even unicast addresses you have to

977
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,200
use mld for the solid state not

978
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,440
to us it's a very crazy and complex

979
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,800
operation htfo5 got rid of that so note

980
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,960
that just as unique as the 505 did not

981
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,440
have mlt and now we are removing mrd

982
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,839
from test addresses no i understand that

983
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,160
my next question is is really or the

984
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,079
next observation is that

985
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,800
as we discussed before 8505 and all the

986
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,400
other related

987
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,320
iot

988
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,599
enhancements labor discovery and

989
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,839
everything else not only apply to iot

990
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,359
networks right they can be used in any

991
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,520
ipv6 network

992
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,400
yeah yeah exactly right so yes you're

993
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,240
complete throughout the correct route as

994
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,920
well

995
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,520
right so yeah this

996
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,079
uh i mean obviously concerns me because

997
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,119
i'm also the the ad for pim

998
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,440
and uh one of the things that pim has in

999
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,599
his plate is to

1000
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,599
move mld

1001
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,320
v2 to internet standard

1002
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,640
uh uh sorry who the mld sorry i missed

1003
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,000
that mld they're moving mld to internet

1004
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,480
standard

1005
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,200
well yes this thing

1006
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,800
does not i mean

1007
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,160
that doesn't mean

1008
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,760
the fact that there are other solutions

1009
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,000
doesn't mean that mld cannot be an

1010
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,520
interest standard right

1011
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,119
um but yes it would be great if they

1012
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,960
saw this

1013
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,920
um

1014
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,440
and you know i don't know provided

1015
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,599
opinions or whatever

1016
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,280
it may be

1017
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,720
it may give them ideas on how to make

1018
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,400
him out be

1019
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,119
mld uh sorry uh more efficient or i

1020
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,560
don't know whatever uh but yes so

1021
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,319
i searched the archives as far as i can

1022
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:09,760
see pym has not been made aware of this

1023
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,000
can you please maybe you send an email

1024
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,680
to pim or i don't know if we need to get

1025
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,200
the six load chairs

1026
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,319
to do that um

1027
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,880
did pim already meet this week

1028
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,599
yes yes okay so that's to be an email

1029
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,000
but yes we need to congregate with them

1030
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,040
i guess

1031
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,359
yes that would be neat

1032
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,119
uh yes we are we're removing completely

1033
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,680
from the six the 6lm can do unicast any

1034
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,760
cast and multicast without any mld

1035
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,119
that's really the bottom line right

1036
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,240
correct

1037
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,960
um okay i mean so at least uh if you can

1038
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,359
uh i'll go talk to eric as well

1039
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,760
um if you can just send a pointer to the

1040
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,359
pin list hey you know take a look at

1041
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,839
this

1042
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,960
um and see if there's any reaction i

1043
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,280
mean no no need i don't think that that

1044
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,720
should result in any holding of the

1045
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,480
document or anything like that but just

1046
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,319
to get uh your reaction from them would

1047
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,680
be would be good at least just to make

1048
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,960
them aware

1049
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,520
sure and another hint is is i have this

1050
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,760
draft at evpn i i don't know if you're

1051
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,240
the id for best i think not

1052
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,760
no no no

1053
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,319
you're right and and well we

1054
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,319
base also has a very complex story for

1055
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,200
for multicast and this this makes it a

1056
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,520
lot simpler actually so

1057
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,520
um we we well

1058
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,839
incorporating unicast any guest and

1059
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,400
multicast in the same interaction host

1060
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,079
to router would simplify the operation

1061
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,480
of the router to inject it in the vpn as

1062
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,839
well so so i i plan to modify the draft

1063
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,119
that you see here

1064
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,400
to also

1065
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,200
suggest any custom multicast

1066
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,560
and all we're doing now that i see the

1067
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,040
word secure all you're doing is

1068
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,319
um

1069
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,839
multicast targets not multicast sources

1070
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,319
right oh it's not source dependent it's

1071
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,240
just it's also independent only because

1072
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,079
we we do that for repo

1073
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,880
uh so for now there is no way to in repo

1074
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,400
or 0.6 lopez to say source dependent yes

1075
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,160
it's it's completely so similar

1076
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,439
thanks

1077
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,599
michael i

1078
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,240
and mean

1079
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,440
do you want to

1080
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,119
yeah hi um

1081
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,359
so i i gave you my feedback on the six

1082
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,839
little list a couple weeks ago and um we

1083
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,520
had a brief conversation and i guess the

1084
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,440
question i have is

1085
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,079
whether or not your document should be

1086
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,160
split into a six flow and a role

1087
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,599
component and what i'm really

1088
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,480
particularly interested in is whether or

1089
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,800
not the um

1090
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,480
the non-role parts of it will be

1091
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,280
easier to understand by others

1092
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,560
um without the role if we do it that way

1093
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,520
um and or otherwise what happens is that

1094
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,960
the other people say oh this is just

1095
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,880
about role forget about that i don't run

1096
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,800
role on my network so i don't care

1097
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,640
um and i and i really think that um

1098
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,880
for fear of violating the russian

1099
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,440
proverb you know uh good is uh good

1100
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,520
enough is better than perfect right or

1101
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,160
whatever it goes um perfect is the enemy

1102
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,480
of good enough that's the proverb um

1103
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,640
that trying to do this in a more general

1104
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,119
way may actually sabotage us and doing

1105
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,079
it in a more specific way is that safer

1106
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:22,880
so

1107
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,480
i feel two things about that and i'm

1108
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,400
wondering what where you feel on that

1109
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,200
field now

1110
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,880
so i i rejoined just to second what

1111
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,040
michael was saying

1112
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,400
because i think it's important for

1113
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,599
owns the whole thing if we don't want to

1114
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:50,960
break it up

1115
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,440
but it definitely needs a

1116
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,560
role review

1117
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,720
this is something i'll also talk to uh

1118
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,079
eric klein about

1119
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,680
but uh i guess

1120
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,359
and dominique if you can also talk to

1121
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,599
six load chairs to make sure that

1122
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,280
uh yeah we last called the document here

1123
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,640
as well right if it's going to have

1124
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,200
ripple elements in there we need that to

1125
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,160
happen

1126
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,680
i'm not really concerned about that

1127
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,280
alvaro i think that we'll get that

1128
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,880
anyway um

1129
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,640
but i'm actually more concerned about

1130
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,400
the opposite which is that

1131
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,280
the non-roll parts get review out to int

1132
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,240
area

1133
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,040
and that they they and as you said pim

1134
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,920
okay uh and you know doing things um

1135
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,079
that that we really can seriously

1136
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,280
consider this is a major

1137
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,839
that this this is a major problem uh i

1138
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,920
think out there um i actually am

1139
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,640
debugging mld issues across the

1140
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,680
um

1141
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,440
too many vendor five different vendors

1142
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,760
of switches can connected together and

1143
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,760
it doesn't work across at all

1144
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,319
and so v6 doesn't work very well

1145
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,800
um and we're gonna have to throw out

1146
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,480
some equipment right so that's the only

1147
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,960
solution we have at this point um

1148
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,640
so nothing to do with protocols except

1149
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,800
that gosh i wish it would go away

1150
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,960
and not be a problem uh because it's not

1151
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,560
really helping me and i don't think it's

1152
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,640
it's that that i think that we need to

1153
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,359
move on to away from what i call layer

1154
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,440
two tricks to make this work and and

1155
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,880
focus on

1156
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,200
layer three

1157
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,800
okay thank you very much pascal and

1158
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,200
michael we need to move forward we can

1159
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,000
take this to the mailing list but yes if

1160
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,079
this document have role topics uh

1161
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,040
and if we do it in six no we are going

1162
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,920
to

1163
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,520
ask review for

1164
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,839
role as well

1165
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,839
um okay thank you very much

1166
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:49,119
um okay next slide

1167
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,240
[Music]

1168
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,040
projection er pascal

1169
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,560
please

1170
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,400
do you have yes so i i haven't

1171
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,560
so i saw that the projection was on the

1172
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,720
agenda but not really

1173
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,040
a full space for it but i just since it

1174
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,800
a lot happened to it i wanted to give a

1175
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,440
very short

1176
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,240
status so so basically the last revision

1177
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,839
is now 21

1178
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,720
and it bumped to two levels because of

1179
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,480
the interactions with dollars tallest

1180
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,720
did the next cent very very deep very

1181
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,920
complete line-by-line review of the

1182
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,119
document

1183
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,920
both on content you know functions and

1184
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,200
and structure

1185
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,119
so so you'll see that the changes

1186
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,760
address very much everything of that

1187
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,440
and i think it was really really

1188
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,760
beneficial for document i hope it's much

1189
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,280
more readable for somebody who has not

1190
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,200
read it in the first place so that's why

1191
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,599
i was asking ramos to hold his review

1192
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,640
till i published at least 20. but now as

1193
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,400
you realize it's ready and i'm happy

1194
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,359
that you called for reverse rs2 to do

1195
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:58,800
his review and mike as well that would

1196
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,240
be grand

1197
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,240
um based on you know the comments by

1198
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,640
tallest and the revision i'm i'm

1199
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,000
personally

1200
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,839
happy to start what group let's go

1201
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,240
anytime because i think that really

1202
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,319
we've got we've gotten where we want it

1203
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,720
to be and anywhere good last call is not

1204
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,400
publication request right we still have

1205
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,359
to

1206
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:21,200
to get uh reviews and feedback and

1207
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,280
solve the issues so

1208
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,200
mean if you want to delay the workplace

1209
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,520
call uh till other reviews

1210
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,319
i'm fine uh i'm also perfectly fine if

1211
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,079
michael and remus aries do their review

1212
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,240
as part of the work of glasgow

1213
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,119
because i think that the document is

1214
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,680
the restructure and now hopefully much

1215
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,760
more stable and i won't restructure it

1216
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,520
again if you go to the next slide you

1217
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,319
will see what happened

1218
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,280
so um here is what happened in one slide

1219
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,119
because i didn't have 10 minutes

1220
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,280
um the introduction is much simpler

1221
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,880
shorter because we have a new section

1222
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,040
three uh which basically uh was

1223
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,520
requested by dollars to to explain the

1224
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,720
domain uh explain what the requirement

1225
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,119
you know why we are doing this and

1226
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,520
uh what kind of use case it's how it's

1227
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,880
going to work

1228
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,040
so all the contacts so we have a

1229
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,280
large six section three now which

1230
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,559
reintroduces uh the story and so the

1231
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,920
main introduction now became smaller

1232
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,800
we have extended

1233
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,559
the projected dial

1234
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,040
sections into a new section actually but

1235
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,200
we have extended it to do not only the

1236
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,280
mosquito setup but also everything about

1237
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,359
maintenance

1238
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:34,720
we have moved

1239
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,280
the uh section nine

1240
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,440
up in that new section street i was

1241
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,119
discussing which is basically all the

1242
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,599
context and end goal of the document so

1243
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,440
the whole section nine example track

1244
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,760
signaling etc has moved up so you see

1245
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,760
what we're doing and why we're doing it

1246
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,680
before the how we are doing it

1247
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,599
yeah and there were some identics about

1248
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,000
use cases applications blah and now this

1249
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,359
also moved up

1250
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,119
in in the context and goal section so

1251
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,640
you see this context and call section

1252
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,720
specifies nothing but gives a lot of

1253
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,000
information about what we are doing and

1254
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,760
why we are doing it

1255
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,079
uh top right and we we have more terms

1256
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,680
now um you'll see that terminology has

1257
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,079
what i would say i would call uh

1258
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,480
domain terminology so terminology terms

1259
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,760
that are not necessarily defined in this

1260
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,760
document by this document but used by

1261
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,599
this document going from the general

1262
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,440
domain of the knowledge the

1263
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,200
general knowledge of the domain so they

1264
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,559
are now redefined

1265
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,040
recited here

1266
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,880
the section three of this big piece and

1267
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,119
the second from top right new and move

1268
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:35,599
text this is all this big new section

1269
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,839
three that i was talking about

1270
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,400
you'll find particulars reflect two as

1271
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,280
new uh use cases

1272
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,680
for making more complex tracks

1273
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,480
the protocol operation is now section

1274
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,480
six and as you can see with the second

1275
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,160
blue arrow on the bottom right it's

1276
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,240
gotten bigger as well it has all this

1277
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,680
information about all the steps for

1278
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,200
creating setting up destroying

1279
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,359
maintaining tracks

1280
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:02,400
and

1281
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,880
again the pound or less request bottom

1282
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,760
right

1283
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,680
you see because tolerance was asking hey

1284
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,680
uh we plan to use repo we do use

1285
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,839
reported

1286
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:12,720
enema

1287
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,319
the control plane so so

1288
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,720
how much does this apply to anybody

1289
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,960
because we we would have needed it and

1290
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,800
so i explained in that section now that

1291
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,880
it does indeed apply to

1292
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,079
use cases beyond iot and that's

1293
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,480
how some things basically some kind of

1294
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,160
modification extensions that we already

1295
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,839
did for animal you you need this you

1296
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,440
don't need that

1297
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,839
so this is this is the result of the

1298
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:39,920
review by dollars and hopefully it's a

1299
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,920
lot more readable and more complex

1300
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,240
because you know tallest did not leave

1301
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,440
anything

1302
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,319
uh to magic you wanted everything really

1303
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:50,079
completely specified

1304
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,480
so i really appreciated this review

1305
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,559
and i'm i'm quite confident that we can

1306
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,720
go for alaska you know with this

1307
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,119
but i'm okay i mean waiting for rainbow

1308
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,920
silver michael as well she's charcoal

1309
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,160
and i'm done that was all my slots

1310
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,319
okay great thank you very much

1311
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,040
please go through the emails

1312
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,520
uh no stories to the tickets and close

1313
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,119
them if it's uh if they are done

1314
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:16,640
okay thank you

1315
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,520
um

1316
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,599
conrad yes most of them were obsolete i

1317
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,359
think we had that discussion earlier but

1318
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,119
they were really really old and obsolete

1319
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,400
but if you want to have a call

1320
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,480
separately offline we can we could

1321
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,800
briefly have a session together and just

1322
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,559
go through them okay

1323
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,119
okay okay okay thank you

1324
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,800

1326
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,200

yes we can hear you very well yeah okay

1328
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,800
thank you very much so um

1329
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,960
i'm about to talk about

1330
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,760
the draft rnv draft

1331
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,839
so as some of you may remember it was

1332
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,440
submitted

1333
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,839
somewhere sometime in april

1334
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,240
then i presented in august

1335
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,559
the interim and just resubmitted to make

1336
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:05,520
it active so what i did is mostly

1337
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,880
from the working group members um so

1338
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,720
they concerned like floating products

1339
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,640
virtual dock routes and sentinel

1340
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,079
selection

1341
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,240
and also some minor like editorial

1342
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,280
comments by michael and pascal

1343
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,920
and also

1344
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,280
i added one

1345
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,480
section

1346
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,480
which allows for activating and

1347
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,520
deactivating the protocol on demand

1348
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,480
and i found this useful like if you

1349
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,400
don't want to

1350
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,160
use it or

1351
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,240
want to for instance deactivate it

1352
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,480
because of i don't know

1353
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,559
high false positive rate

1354
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,319
or do some

1355
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:47,680
like emergency deactivation then um

1356
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,000
this is what it can be used for

1357
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,839
so uh so i think that the protocol now

1358
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:56,640
addresses all major comments i

1359
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,640
also went through the

1360
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,720
the talk during uh

1361
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,720
the the recording from from the

1362
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,760
interview

1363
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,119
about pascal's comments uh

1364
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,559
and uh

1365
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:09,599
well

1366
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:10,640
uh

1367
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,400
i think some of them are beyond the

1368
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,880
scope and some of them

1369
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,559
well

1370
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,119
they cannot be like easily addressed

1371
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,680
so especially about

1372
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,520
some parameters of the protocol being

1373
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,200
global

1374
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,520
but i don't think that

1375
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,880
well

1376
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,359
they constitute much of a problem

1377
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,640
so

1378
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,800
the question now is whether we want to

1379
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,599
adopt the draft or not i guess

1380
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:39,520
and if you have any further questions

1381
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,559
then i can reply now or via email

1382
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,319
yes so

1383
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,558
um

1384
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:59,369
[Music]

1385
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,070
[Music]

1386
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,240
speakers so you should mute

1387
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,440
one or the other

1388
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,839
okay so um i

1389
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:15,760
produce power um

1390
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,440
yeah and i'm not using my headset

1391
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,119
because wireless and sometimes the mic

1392
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:19,920
goes

1393
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,240
and so it doesn't help a lot

1394
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,760
so sorry i did not move to your

1395
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,480
recommendation um so what i was saying

1396
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,480
is this is this is classical byzantine

1397
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,720
general problem right so so you you have

1398
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,839
to find

1399
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,920
um an agreement between at least

1400
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,680
two-thirds of the interventions to to

1401
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,160
decide whether something is true or not

1402
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,839
it's it's very hard private general and

1403
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:42,160
then we have this issue that

1404
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,839
you're trying you are trying not to go

1405
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,680
through the root

1406
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,680
um which makes the prime of another

1407
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,079
because for many of those generals

1408
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,880
uh only the route is is available to

1409
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,119
talk between one another another

1410
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:55,839
so

1411
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,920
this this is a hard problem

1412
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,839
it's it's also a very important thing to

1413
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,680
solve the nodes need to know if the root

1414
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,880
is still there

1415
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,480
and and they need to know rapidly so

1416
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,720
we i believe we need to adopt because we

1417
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,359
want this problem solved but we we want

1418
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,440
to be very very sure that it's not

1419
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,280
because we're adopting this document

1420
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,440
that we are completely sure

1421
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,480
that the

1422
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,680
inceptions you know the basic mechanism

1423
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,799
proposed here is is the right one uh

1424
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,720
there's a lot of art

1425
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,880
to to resolve consensus and that's

1426
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,520
exactly what where this work falls in

1427
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,680
it's consciousness resolution

1428
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,520
we need to make sure that we have

1429
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,440
explored you know the the best of that

1430
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,599
art with this particular prime that the

1431
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,440
root that is needed for building this

1432
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,680
consciousness is effectively guard

1433
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,839
which makes the primitive

1434
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,359
so yes

1435
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,119
on my side i would say yes to approve

1436
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,520
but to adopt but not yes to to put a

1437
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,119
final decision on the algorithm

1438
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,319
that would be fine i i can imagine that

1439
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:01,280
we can

1440
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,119
still correct the algorithms

1441
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,760
like the initial let's say command

1442
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,280
more specifically

1443
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,880
so some issues are left out of the

1444
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,440
algorithm uh like they are

1445
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,440
like external to the algorithm and

1446
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,319
perhaps it would make sense to actually

1447
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:17,839
for instance to get rid of some of the

1448
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,799
parameters to actually include like

1449
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,359
routing through the root and so on so

1450
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:26,000
uh yeah

1451
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,880
um i think adapting doesn't mean we

1452
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,040
agree on the solution adapting means we

1453
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:31,920
agree

1454
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,119
that this

1455
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,880
the working group wants to work on that

1456
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,839
topic

1457
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,880
so this seems totally in line with both

1458
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,960
of you michael you had a comment as well

1459
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,000
what you said is that i think that the

1460
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,599
documents should be adopted when they

1461
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,079
have a clear a clear articulation of a

1462
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:51,520
problem and i don't care whether the

1463
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,720
solution is

1464
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,119
sane or not um it's

1465
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,720
adoption is because the working group

1466
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,400
says yeah we got to solve this problem

1467
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,280
and so i agree with you completely

1468
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,680
thank you

1469
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,400
so

1470
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,880
we're running short on time but is any

1471
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,000
objection strong objection here to adopt

1472
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,799
this document

1473
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,839
if there's any speak up now

1474
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,680
otherwise we'll confirm on a mailing

1475
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,640
list as usual but we're

1476
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,799
in a good way towards adoption it seems

1477
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,520
okay and then we'll take care of the

1478
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,960
other questions

1479
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,240
later on the mailing list

1480
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,119
when we adapt we also need to say i

1481
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,720
would like to see if we adopt it for

1482
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,200
experiment or adopt it for star trek

1483
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:02,160
i don't know that we have to decide that

1484
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,880
at that point do we

1485
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,359
that's any at any point before my asg

1486
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,280
submission right

1487
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,440
i don't think we do but it's good to

1488
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,480
know

1489
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,440
okay okay

1490
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,079
okay thank you anna for about the next

1491
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:21,280
topic the enrollment priority we got a

1492
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,440
preview from conrad

1493
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,760
and where the contract proposed like two

1494
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,640
use cases global and flexible two

1495
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,880
no use cases uh two

1496
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,440
different way of addressing

1497
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,359
um for global we have this total control

1498
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:40,160
congestion but

1499
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,559
load balancing but for flexified we did

1500
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,359
not find any use case

1501
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,119
so far

1502
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:49,599
but for this document we will need more

1503
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,359
reviews

1504
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:54,319
and there are some open issues in github

1505
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,160
and then i think we can go through

1506
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,920
workgroup last call

1507
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,920
someone volunteered to review this draft

1508
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,440
they say that i think that uh probably

1509
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,000
uh the authors haven't really gotten

1510
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,400
together to discuss this enough and we

1511
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,240
probably should do that schedule

1512
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,000
something and do that

1513
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,440
um

1514
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,400
and i think it's fallen below the

1515
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,440
below the fold priority wise

1516
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,400
for us to review this um

1517
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,160
so clearly we want to have something in

1518
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,839
the solution and it's possible that what

1519
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:35,680
we proposed is simply unworkable but

1520
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,440
then i've heard other people say it's

1521
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,119
not a problem so

1522
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,200
um

1523
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,000
uh it might be that we have to re go

1524
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,240
step back and try again with

1525
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,880
capabilities or something

1526
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,359
i don't know

1527
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:55,040
okay thank you pascal

1528
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,720
yeah i think

1529
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,280
michael i think it's perfectly workable

1530
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,079
and that we should ship it because the

1531
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:06,640
again why sun is asking for it

1532
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,799
and this draft fits what they want and

1533
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:10,240
they have an operational understanding

1534
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,520
of what they want

1535
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,400
so uh no i don't think we went outside

1536
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,880
the the one thing that that we missed

1537
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,200
was we at some point we thought that

1538
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,599
this value this priority that we are

1539
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:23,680
mean priority that we're passing should

1540
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,359
be uh

1541
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,839
changed on the way down

1542
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:30,319
and uh that made it unworkable

1543
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:33,760
effectively but if we agree that it's

1544
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,599
set by the root and just propagated

1545
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,359
without the change

1546
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:39,680
uh down you know the dios

1547
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,480
just

1548
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,680
what you expose on on the uh

1549
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,240
beacon can be based on that and can be

1550
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,839
different from that but but at least

1551
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:50,559
it's it's going down unchanged then it's

1552
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,280
perfectly workable and perfectly useful

1553
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,480
i think that that's what we yeah and i i

1554
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,319
don't think we really got that clearly

1555
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,559
into the document the last revision but

1556
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:03,520
um uh that's what i think we need to do

1557
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,559
and um if if if i just not sure i just

1558
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,319
wasn't sure that the authors were all in

1559
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:10,000
consensus about this at this point

1560
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,280
because i don't think we discussed this

1561
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,040
with class meeting

1562
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,200
i think we were michael it's just memory

1563
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,760
you know but my memory is that we were

1564
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,480
and that we agreed that we don't

1565
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,480
modify the value as we go down that was

1566
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,040
discussion at the last meeting

1567
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,319
that you know

1568
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:28,079
seeing the discussion at the license on

1569
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:29,440
the western side they really need the

1570
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,520
size of the deodorant express number for

1571
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,040
arts blah that's information that they

1572
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,079
do want

1573
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,559
and so they are explicitly wait waiting

1574
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,319
for this just the same way well then

1575
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,559
maybe we just need to to ship it is what

1576
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,880
you're saying is that that there yeah so

1577
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,400
um uh

1578
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,880
so i will get a new revision posted by

1579
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,880
the end of the month and if that isn't

1580
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,440
is good enough um did we start did we do

1581
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,880
a working group last call are we in the

1582
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,160
middle of working group no we're not

1583
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,480

1584
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,960
we need one review more but yes with the

1585

1587
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,079

1588
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:05,520

1589
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,880
