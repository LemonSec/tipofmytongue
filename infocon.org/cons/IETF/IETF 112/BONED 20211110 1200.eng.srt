55
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,360

56
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,480
we can wait

57
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,160

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,400
here

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,680
give it another minute or so

60
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,040
yeah another minute i mean agenda's

61
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,720
pretty small so

62
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,239
this is uh really the jake show

63
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,800
it's a head count now

64
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
it's gonna be way shorter than my slot

65
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,120

66
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,480
we should have

67
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,599

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,480
be a

177
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,080
pretty quick

178
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,519
update here

179
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,720
but

180
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,320
you know we do have time in the agenda

181
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,959
so i'd be happy to have

182
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,560
discussion questions around this and

183
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,240
suggestions of what you'd like to see

184
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,920
going forward

185
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,760
all right so what are we talking about

186
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,839
so

187
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,120
specifically uh

188
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,760
this new entitlement

189
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,519
um

190
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,040
when an entitlement for people who are

191
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,920
not familiar with it on at least mac os

192
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,760
and ios is

193
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,000
essentially a

194
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,600
privilege that has to be signed into the

195
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,680
binary of the application when it's

196
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,040
before it can be released on the app

197
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,320
store

198
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,640
and

199
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,320
some entitlements you can just kind of

200
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,920
check a box this is one that you have to

201
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,440
request

202
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,600
so it's a little bit heavier weight

203
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,160
anyway this is part of a

204
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,519
general

205
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,680
suite of changes that we did to add

206
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,200
restrictions around what you could do on

207
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,760
the local network um

208
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,600
and

209
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,240
these are all aimed at trying to improve

210
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,959
user privacy from various types of

211
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,720
attacks

212
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,040
and so this was introduced in ios 14 so

213
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,760
that means um we announced this

214
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,040
in um our developers conference which

215
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,880
occurred in

216
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,240
june of 2020 so

217
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,560
a year a year and a half ago

218
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,440
and the release came out over a year ago

219
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,839
at this point so this has kind of been

220
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,519
the reality for

221
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,399
the last little bit

222
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,680
and

223
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,560
there are several different changes

224
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,720
that were part of this uh

225
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,480
local network privacy feature overall

226
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,240
first

227
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,040
all apps that are communicating with

228
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,880
hosts on their local network whether

229
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,800
that's unicast multicast

230
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,279
using apis that will trigger

231
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,360
local network interactions

232
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,440
they all must get user permission before

233
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,600
communicating

234
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,440
so you know it's assumed that if i'm

235
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,040
using an app

236
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,720
sure maybe it's talking to the internet

237
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,800
into the wide area network but before it

238
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,120
can start you know poking into my

239
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,880
tv and my printers around me and trying

240
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,959
to do stuff

241
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,040
the user just has to give permission

242
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,839
this really makes

243
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,760
a lot of local network interactions more

244
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,320
consistent with other

245
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,800
kind of nearby device interactions that

246
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,519
required a similar privacy permission

247
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,839
such as connecting to a bluetooth device

248
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:12,959
etc

249
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,880
so a lot of this is about

250
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,720
consistency and user awareness

251
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,279
the next category of change is that

252
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,399
you know most

253
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,040
of the multicast discovery

254
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,560
that occurs

255
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,200
on ios devices

256
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,519
is using system apis for multicast dns

257
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,560
using dns service discovery on apple

258
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,560
platforms that's branded as bonjour

259
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,600
and

260
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,920
any app that's using that

261
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,360
must

262
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,040
declare kind of at compile time the

263
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,800
static list

264
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,279
of all of the different

265
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,519
service types that they plan to use so

266
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,959
they can't

267
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,959
use any service type that's outside of

268
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,959
that list they can't just start doing

269
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,599
wild card discovery

270
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,320
and then the third category which is the

271
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,480
one that we're talking about here

272
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,839
is

273
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,200
specifically for

274
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,440
multicast and broadcast

275
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,720
um

276
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,519
that's not using any

277
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,959
system api like what we have for

278
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,560
multicast dns

279
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,880
an app must have an entitlement because

280
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,519
this is a

281
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,440
kind of even more privileged and

282
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,519
powerful operation

283
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,920
so that's what was restricted but you

284
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,440
know why

285
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,760
why was this done

286
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,959
um a lot of this was done in reaction to

287
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,279
a growing trend that we saw

288
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,760
in which

289
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,959
very

290
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,040
surprising apps

291
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,600
were doing some arbitrary scanning

292
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,880
of the local network

293
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,800
that

294
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,360
seems really to be

295
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,920
a kind of a user tracking device that

296
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,600
was becoming more common so we wanted to

297
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,360
make sure that that did not grow further

298
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,920
often times

299
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,680
functionality like this can be embedded

300
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,959
within sdks that apps link in

301
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,399
to get some sort of functionality

302
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,199
and so this is not always code that the

303
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,760
developers of apps even realize is being

304
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,519
run within their apps but instead

305
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,600
some third-party library that they had

306
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,440
linked in

307
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,839
that you know maybe in return for being

308
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,440
free was collecting some data about

309
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,959
users in user location

310
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,120
um

311
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,199
and so in general

312
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,360
you would see

313
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,839
when we turn this on first

314
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:52,720
uh

315
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,519
and just to say hey what lights up what

316
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,600
starts uh scanning your network on

317
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,959
different ports and on different

318
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,240
addresses

319
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,000
it was quite a lot

320
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,839
of apps doing it uh very frequently

321
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,360
and you know some of these can be

322
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,680
legitimate use cases but

323
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,040
a lot of them also could be efforts to

324
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,440
detect

325
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,920
what devices were around what types of

326
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,839
things would respond on the local

327
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,880
network

328
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,959
to create a signature of the local

329
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,160
network

330
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,880
that the user is on currently

331
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,839
we had

332
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,079
for years before

333
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,560
uh prevented apps from getting directly

334
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,759
at some of the ssid or bssid

335
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,759
information to know oh the user is

336
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,120
currently

337
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,519
you know in this location as a way to

338
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,560
evade getting location permissions

339
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,320
if they didn't think that the user would

340
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,000
grant location tracking

341
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,880
now in general you know as i mentioned

342
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,959
for bonjour we

343
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,959
kind of started preferring

344
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,040
apis where you could list a specific

345
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,160
service type um so

346
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,120
this

347
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,320
guarantees that the app developer is

348
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,880
aware of what they are doing um so you

349
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,920
know if i have an app that's trying to

350
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,360
talk to a printer or i'm trying to

351
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,600
discover a tv that i can display

352
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,120
something on

353
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,199
indicating

354
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,560
at the

355
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,199
app compile time yes this is the type of

356
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,720
service i'm trying to do or maybe i have

357
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,639
a custom service for my own special

358
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,120
devices or i'm doing some peer-to-peer

359
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,279
game

360
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,360
if if they can specify here's the exact

361
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,120
scope of what i need to do

362
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
it's much easier to guarantee that

363
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,800
there's not other code running that's

364
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,199
doing uh nefarious things or trying to

365
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,399
do a full

366
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,000
address and port scan

367
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,839
of all devices around

368
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,519
and then the other

369
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,720
um

370
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,920
aspect here is that

371
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,920
there are uses of multicast that we see

372
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,720
as kind of the most prevalent um as

373
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,039
we've been granting these entitlements

374
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,520
by far the most common is oh yeah i just

375
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,880
want to use

376
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,959
um ssdp

377
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,720
which

378
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,359
is you know pretty old protocol not

379
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,720
standard has a lot of security

380
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,439
vulnerabilities and

381
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,880
this is also an opportunity to tell

382
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,319
people hey if you're just trying to do

383
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,199
this discovery

384
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,160
going and using a system api that is

385
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,600
more audited and using a standard

386
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,400
protocol like multicast dns

387
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,919
is going to be a better route if you're

388
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,160
building a new solution so we're also

389
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,320
trying to have people move

390
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,080
to preferred protocols when it's

391
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,080
possible

392
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
um so going forward

393
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,160
you know apps that do have legitimate

394
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,400
reasons to need custom multicast can get

395
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,480
approved they just need to

396
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,679
um fill out a form to say

397
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,440
what are they trying to do and

398
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,480
almost everything does get approved

399
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,360
generally what wouldn't get approved is

400
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,280
um

401
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,600
if you cannot sufficiently explain

402
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,280
like

403
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,120
what address and ports are you trying to

404
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,280
use like what what what is your why does

405
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,120
your app have to do this

406
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,199
um or if they're trying to

407
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,840
get around the

408
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,760
multicast dns

409
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,840
service type restriction by

410
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,240
implementing

411
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,120
a custom stack that will let them scan

412
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,879
all multicast services around them

413
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,320
and

414
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,240
another part of the philosophy going

415
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,360
forward is that

416
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,640
the common sdks you know like what we

417
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,120
have with uh you know there's google's

418
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
casting sdk

419
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,880
we worked with them to move to using

420
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,480
system system-supported apis and

421
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,640
implementations of bonjour that don't

422
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,480
require applications to get entitlements

423
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,679
and i'll

424
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,960
point out that

425
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,360
right now the main thing that you can do

426
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,840
with an entitlement that is multicast is

427
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,039
bonjour

428
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,840
multicast dns

429
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,840
that doesn't mean that that has to stay

430
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,880
a fixed

431
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,200
list if there are other things

432
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,520
that become

433
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,760
very relevant for ios apps

434
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,360
that should be kind of built into the

435
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,600
system and saying ah well this multicast

436
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,200
protocol should be supported as kind of

437
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,799
a native

438
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,840
protocol

439
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
that's going to be generic for a lot of

440
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,919
different apps that could certainly be

441
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,080
done and that would kind of fit into the

442
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,799
model of making sure that

443
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,160
generic

444
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,720
apps aren't accidentally putting in some

445
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,919
tracking software into their apps

446
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,160
so just some other resources

447
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,160
uh we have our 2020 presentation on

448
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,679
local network privacy in general and

449
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,480
then

450
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,559
probably more interesting is this

451
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,159
separate uh

452
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,320
article we put about out about how to

453
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,400
use multicast

454
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,320
we offered some new apis around doing

455
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,480
multicast that year

456
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,320
that were part of our network framework

457
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
and then it also documents how to get

458
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,080
the entitlement

459
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,720
and that is all i have

460
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,840
do you have questions

461
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,559
hey jack

462
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,880
yeah hi tommy thanks for uh thanks for

463
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,520
this um i did have a couple of questions

464
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,760
so uh

465
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,640
the mdns you

466
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,240
you seem to say it was bonjour or dnssd

467
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,200
but does this distinguish between like

468
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,400
just using a dot local name that also

469
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,840
generally uses mdns

470
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,720
right so

471
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,840
if you use a dot local name

472
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,480
that does not require any special

473
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,120
declaration of

474
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,760
what service types you're using

475
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,120
the special declaration is just for

476
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,840
browsing

477
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,880
um since

478
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,960
that was more like okay you know people

479
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,880
are using this to scan and you know

480
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,559
there definitely are

481
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,960
um so you have to also uh apply for the

482
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,080
entitlement

483
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,720
if you want to be able to do wild card

484
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,559
launcher and there are

485
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,400
you know utilities that are just about

486
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,159
scanning every device around you and

487
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,840
reporting this is what your local

488
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,760
network looks like um

489
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,840
but we recognize that those are usually

490
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,039
pretty niche

491
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,039
products

492
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,000
uh so

493
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,120
so there's nothing that prevents

494
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,600
scanning just according to a bunch of

495
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,840
dot local names for example or is that

496
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,159
just a sort of separate

497
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,520
configuration

498
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
i mean

499
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,440
yes you could try to brute force like

500
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,080
every possible string in the world um

501
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,799
no note or known devices i guess does

502
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,280
require the user permission so like the

503
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,840
user will get a pop-up of do you want

504
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,440
to scan your local network i see okay

505
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,640
um

506
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,720
but not not separate for each dot local

507
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,760
name right or no no okay

508
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,679
okay yes or no

509
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,159
interesting all right um

510
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,320
my other question

511
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,559
my second question maybe uh are there

512
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,159
any differences between uh ssm and asm

513
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,159
or between uh

514
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,600
globally or locally scoped addresses

515
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,640
uh

516
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,679
no no we're not uh doing any distinction

517
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,559
there

518
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,880
currently okay

519
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,400
uh and then

520
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,760
my last question was um

521
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,880
do you are there any sort of

522
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,440
known changes you anticipate to this

523
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,200
going forward or you think this kind of

524
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,799
covers uh

525
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,200
the the sorts of

526
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,640
uh efforts you've seen and um

527
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,000
and nothing else would be necessary

528
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,360
uh

529
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,880
no no changes

530
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,280
kind of you know we just released ios 15

531
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,600
that stayed the same um

532
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,760
that's pretty stable

533
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,159
i i would love to hear from you or from

534
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,640
people in the group like

535
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,440
you know what kind of what raised this

536
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,600
to your attention and

537
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,240
are there use cases

538
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,280
that you think should be common enough

539
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,480
that they shouldn't require an

540
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,480
entitlement and what is that and how

541
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,640
how how could we create a graceful path

542
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,120
for those

543
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,720
uh sure i can answer for myself at least

544
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,960
there was a an article forwarded where

545
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,279
someone was kind of bemoaning the extra

546
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,559
bureaucracy

547
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,679
uh

548
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,000
for um

549
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,919
for just you know experimenting with

550
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,679
multicast in an app development sense

551
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,159
saying kind of multicast is hard enough

552
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,679
i i think that had some sympathetic ears

553
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,240
on the list when it was forwarded but um

554
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,400
you know

555
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,880
i mean we've been working on the on the

556
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,159
security and and noting the

557
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,000
uh i don't know if you saw the draft

558
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,320
insect dispatch uh right after your slot

559
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,240
but um

560
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,679
uh yeah there are some sort of

561
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,720
potential exposures

562
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
and so um

563
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,600
you know yeah i

564
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,200
i didn't think it was necessarily a bad

565
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,039
thing as long as it's not a sort of

566
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,279
onerous process so um

567
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,640
just for my own opinion there yeah

568
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,919
and i think there are some other takes

569
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,200
on it

570
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,080
yeah um

571
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,039
i i know that you know there are

572
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,360
a handful of people who've requested to

573
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,240
have

574
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,440
kind of complained um

575
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,840
for just for doing experimentation you

576
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,440
know our

577
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,159
simulators macs work just fine without

578
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,159
the restriction it's really just ios

579
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,039
devices here and

580
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,960
they specifically

581
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,559
um

582
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,240
you know oftentimes

583
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,440
if there are requests for

584
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,039
just like oh i'm doing experimentation

585
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,960
is it's often just to discover like

586
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,120
peer-to-peer like hey where's the other

587
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,520
iphone around me and for that

588
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,960
i think we try to steer people to saying

589
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,679
hey just use the system apis for

590
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:38,880
discovering

591
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,440
your app's service nearby

592
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,679
that works just fine why are you trying

593
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,039
to invent

594
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,720
a brand new discovery protocol that's

595
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,919
not dns service discovery it's not ssdp

596
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,600
but you're like rolling your own thing

597
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,320
like that's you're probably

598
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,679
making it harder for yourself and

599
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,760
experimenting

600
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,640
sure

601
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,960
um

602
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,880
uh let's see

603
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,039
i guess i i suppose you're not willing

604
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,640
to name names on uh sdks that were

605
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,039
that had suspicious behavior here yeah

606
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,440
okay just thought i'd ask

607
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,760
thanks

608
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,559
all right any other questions

609
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,400
should we hand it over

610
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,320
so i think um

611
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,960
i understand the entitlement process for

612
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,240
for apps

613
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,640
uh as you're sourcing

614
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,240
so

615
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,799
as just as a user if you want to join a

616
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,960
multicast group there's no entitlement

617
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,960
for that or do you just get a pop-up

618
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,799
that says do you really want to use

619
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,520
multicast or so can can you just explain

620
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,440
what that looks like for not the app

621
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,240
developer but the app user is there

622
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,760
anything on their part that they need to

623
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,520
do or that just works yeah

624
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,760
right so yeah again an entitlement and

625
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,840
the list of bonjour

626
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,039
or multicast dns service types

627
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,520
that's all a developer problem they just

628
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,400
have to bake that into their app

629
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,039
so assuming you have an app

630
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,279
that has permission to use multicast

631
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,640
because they got the entitlement or

632
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,120
they're using multicast dns

633
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,760
or they're just using unicast

634
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,279
on the local network

635
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,120
the only thing the user will see is a

636
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,679
one-time

637
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,600
pop-up to say do you want to let this

638
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,000
app use the local network

639
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,760
and you can say yes or no you can go

640
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,200
back and change that decision in

641
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,440
settings at any point

642
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,279
but

643
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,000
that's it it's pretty

644
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,919
coarse

645
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,919
grained at that point of saying

646
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:40,720
yeah

647
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,720
is this expected the app does get to

648
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,840
pre-populate that prompt with an

649
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,440
explanation of why they use the local

650
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,440
network so the user can say like oh

651
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,279
they're doing this to

652
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,760
do x

653
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,158
and then

654
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,320
we've encouraged people to have that

655
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,240
show up when you're actually starting to

656
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,080
do something that the user wants not

657
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,919
just like at the time you launched the

658
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,440
app

659
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,720
but that's all the user would see

660
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,279
they generally don't have a way to

661
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,600
kind of manually

662
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,240
you there's no you know terminal console

663
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,919
on these devices so they can't like

664
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,159
manually

665
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,080
do some commands that will trigger

666
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,720
multicast

667
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,880
gotcha and um

668
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,640
did uh

669
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,880
you mentioned this this you

670
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,159
this isn't a um your your act

671
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,360
can you give any kind of um

672
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,520
experience in terms of

673
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,679
you mentioned are there

674
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,000
lots of apps that have applied for this

675
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,039
entitlement did you say you guys haven't

676
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,080
denied anyone uh no

677
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,039
i mean some people

678
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,720
there there have been some we have not

679
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,320
approved

680
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,600
um

681
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,000
the vast majority get approved because

682
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,440
the vast majority are legitimate um

683
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,840
gotcha yeah i mean it's it's a bunch i

684
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,360
mean i

685
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,080
i think it's thousands

686
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,880
great ask a question there too and so

687
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,960
the i'm not looking for names but those

688
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,320
that you said that were not approved is

689
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,880
this uh in in the general case because

690
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,000
you can point them in the direction of

691
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,200
something already exist rather than

692
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,520
reinventing something exactly exactly

693
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,039
often times they're like oh

694
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,000
the the most common case is

695
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,240
they were trying to

696
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,679
roll something on their own and they

697
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,919
would say oh oh i can just use this api

698
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,360
to discover

699
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,959
the thing around me great i'll use that

700
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,960
that's that's the most common reason

701
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,880
that they don't end up getting the full

702
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,080
entitlement because they don't need it

703
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,080
any other questions for tommy

704
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,559
all right well tommy thanks for joining

705
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,760
us and thanks for sharing this

706
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,559
information very very helpful

707
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,200
thanks everyone

708
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,840
um next up is jake

709
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,840
let's see i think this is my first time

710
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,039
sharing

711
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,039
the screen so let me

712
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,559
see if i've got this figured out

713
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,159
properly

714
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,640
okay

715
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,240
uh

716
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,520
i think i can

717
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,679
let's just say

718
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,640
yeah okay that's fine

719
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,120
curious was that your compliance

720
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,200
uh button you used

721
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,720
yes that is

722
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,600
that is uh actually no that's that's the

723
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,440
request screen share

724
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,720
okay

725
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,519
told me at the beginning there that uh

726
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,760
that for whatever reason my particular

727
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,039
slides

728
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,679
were not in the pre-loaded list

729
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,279
for some reason i was probably late

730
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,200
um

731
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,919
right so uh thanks i have just a short

732
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,559
update this time um

733
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,840
in the notes i added a link to

734
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
my uh last presentation

735
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,080
uh at 111 um if you do need any

736
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,000
background on these drafts and kind of

737
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,399
what they're doing i'll refer you to to

738
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,559
take a look at that one instead i don't

739
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,360
want to run through the overview of them

740
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,880
each time so i'm just going to skip that

741
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,640
um

742
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,200
mostly what i'm going to cover is the

743
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,399
sort of progress in

744
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,559
that's relevant to this work that's been

745
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,000
happening uh externally uh though i will

746
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
touch on the um

747
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,640
relatively small amount of

748
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,760
uh

749
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,159
forward progress on these docs and um

750
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,200
and

751
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,200
discuss that a little bit

752
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,799
and then i'll go over kind of what my

753
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,559
next steps are in this direction

754
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,960
so the first thing is that

755
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,360
the multicast community group has been

756
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,640
meeting regularly um we did some some

757
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,120
stuff at tpac

758
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,640
uh actually i probably should have

759
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,840
posted the um

760
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,640
the link to the demo video that we put

761
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,240
up but that's that's there in the list

762
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,960
of demo videos that they had for the for

763
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,360
the tpack meeting uh

764
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,279
under the web and networks interest

765
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,320
group

766
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,559
uh the web networks interest group in

767
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,399
particular

768
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,120
had some nice things to say about about

769
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,679
the multicast community group and the

770
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,760
multicast use case

771
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,399
that they presented during their tpac

772
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,320
meeting

773
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,279
i like the slides there uh there's a

774
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,399
good

775
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,810
uh there's some

776
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,360
[Music]

777
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,640
sort of uh

778
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,440
openness to this in the web community um

779
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,559
the most compelling

780
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,080
part of that seemed to be about

781
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,360
the

782
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,039
or at least the one that got the most

783
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,720
discussion was its impact on some of the

784
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,399
sustainability efforts that are getting

785
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,600
started

786
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,960
um

787
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,720
and uh

788
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,279
it's it's relevance to that

789
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,519
uh to that point um

790
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,360
which i i also highlighted in some of

791
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,240
the stuff that i talked about there

792
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,600
um

793
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,000
and i also had a presentation with the

794
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,919
web transport working group

795
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,799
uh it was a sort of

796
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,039
minor part of their of their overall

797
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,080
meeting

798
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,120
um but uh i've opened an issue

799
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,120
requesting uh that they add multicast as

800
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,919
a

801
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,520
as a use case that they would consider

802
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,800
valuable uh which would be uh relevant

803
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,520
feedback to bring to the ietf

804
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,918
web transport working group um

805
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,879
and and other relevant parties that is

806
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,040
under discussion uh i've had a follow-up

807
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,280
meeting with the chairs and and they'll

808
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,159
be uh discussing it in the working group

809
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,159
uh to see what they think about that but

810
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,079
um

811
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,480
that is uh sort of

812
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,879
necessary steps toward moving it to a

813
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,800
browser use case

814
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,079
um

815
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,239
i also presented yesterday insect

816
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,440
dispatch

817
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,960
about uh

818
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,760
so the background on this uh as i think

819
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,000
i went over before but i'll i'll

820
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,599
recap it here

821
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:52,639
we

822
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,399
we

823
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,159
submitted an intent to experiment to

824
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,760
chromium

825
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,880
their feedback was it's not ready

826
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,240
in particular that it needs

827
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,560
confidentiality uh

828
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,880
as well as the integrity and

829
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,960
authenticity that that

830
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
was part of the design

831
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,200
um

832
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,680
in addition to uh implementation

833
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,440
weaknesses that are going to need to be

834
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,720
addressed before it can be part of the

835
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,040
browser even behind a command line flag

836
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,520
totally reasonable um but that's that's

837
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,000
going to be some work

838
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,800
but

839
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
but really the the sticking point was

840
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,480
more about the design

841
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,880
uh before even getting to that point and

842
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,079
uh

843
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,160
so confidentiality with multicast comes

844
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,920
with um

845
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,320
some complexity uh we tried to capture

846
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,680
the complexity in this uh in in the uh

847
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,920
draft k rose sex dispatch multicast

848
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,119
security

849
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,000
uh and we are looking for a home for it

850
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,560
so insect dispatch their uh the

851
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,359
recommendation for dispatch was that we

852
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,680
uh start a mailing list it's to be

853
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,880
determined whether that's going to be

854
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,599
the msec mailing list for the previously

855
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,520
existing

856
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,000
but uh closed multicast security working

857
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,800
group

858
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,400
um

859
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,560
or whether that'll be a new mailing list

860
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,920
and that uh i'm supposed to follow up on

861
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,560
and we'll be sending an email today to

862
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,240
kick that off

863
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,160
hopefully that mailing list will be

864
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,720
like in place uh by the end of the week

865
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,839
i i

866
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,320
i hope but uh we'll see and we'll see if

867
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,240
we can get any security experts on it to

868
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,240
really dig in on this we did get some

869
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,000
discussion from ecker on the list he's

870
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,040
sort of

871
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,320
against the general idea

872
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,880
and is making the case that nobody's

873
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,640
particularly interested

874
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,800
uh and so there's no reason to look at

875
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,240
it um

876
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,959
but uh

877
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,760
the objections he raised to it were

878
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,440
at on the technical side were not

879
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,200
particularly compelling

880
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,079
i was not able to give him uh

881
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,440
compelling evidence that anybody is

882
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,119
interested either so

883
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,200
there might be more such objections if

884
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,640
we kind of get to that stage

885
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,640
but i thought the discussion overall was

886
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,640
pretty good i think he had some

887
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,760
some good points of feedback that we've

888
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,400
started incorporating into the draft

889
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,200
to cover it but

890
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,880
this is uh

891
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,680
this this security draft is

892
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,800
not just about the web uh

893
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,520
safety model the web security model as

894
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,480
it relates to multicast it's uh you know

895
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,280
we we intend to do both web and non-web

896
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,560
traffic

897
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,119
uh at akamai um

898
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,119
assuming this you know

899
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,359
actually reaches a deployment stage

900
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,280
uh and you know

901
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,040
at the moment it's looking likely that

902
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,280
it will start with the non-web traffic

903
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,320
um

904
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,000
where we have uh

905
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,440
you know we'd be relying on on receivers

906
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,119
that have some deployment footprint and

907
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,839
this would include uh potentially

908
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,359
uh some of the gaming platforms for the

909
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,280
game downloads and also some of the um

910
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,119
sort of uh

911
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,640
smart tv on a stick uh platforms that uh

912
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,599
that some of our potential partners

913
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,920
have some deployment footprint with

914
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,440
um

915
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,520
and

916
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,599
and that doesn't have to be web traffic

917
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,920
although being a part of a web api and

918
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,359
doing

919
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,440
the same thing in all the cases might

920
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,599
actually be kind of handy

921
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,480
but not strictly necessary so

922
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,160
we might be able to continue moving

923
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,000
forward with some of that and i think

924
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,920
the target still has to include the

925
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,040
browser

926
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,119
at least from our point of view for this

927
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,040
to be worthwhile in the end because

928
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,960
there's such a

929
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,640
uh you know some of the peaks that we

930
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,320
the peak traffic days that we hope to

931
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,000
address with this work

932
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,800
uh come from web video traffic and we we

933
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,560
do need we do think we need to address

934
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,520
it

935
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,759
um

936
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,240
but uh the the sort of next steps on the

937
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,079
mailing list front with a security

938
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,440
question

939
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,040
uh would

940
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,079
i mean the the target i'm i'm aiming

941
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,640
towards ultimately is

942
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,040
well ultimately is uh rfc is with

943
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,280
consensus behind them but uh to get

944
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,280
there it would take a buff to open a

945
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,000
working group uh again either the

946
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,160
existing mtech or

947
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,680
a new uh you know

948
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,040
maybe

949
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,800
broadcast media

950
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,560
multicast security or some such i don't

951
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,400
know but um

952
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,480
because it's a slightly different uh

953
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,400
security model than the previous msec

954
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,160
work did so it would either have to come

955
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,400
with a recharger or it would have to

956
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,079
be a new working group i'm not sure what

957
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,920
the what the right answer will be there

958
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,240
and that'll be up for discussion

959
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,760
i'm not sure it'll even happen it's

960
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,119
going to depend on

961
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,280
security people agreeing that this is

962
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,720
worth looking at

963
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,839
um

964
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,680
and that they'd be willing to

965
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,599
to contribute but we'll try to get that

966
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,640
discussion going uh between

967
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,480
now and march or

968
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,599
uh whenever however long it takes

969
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,520
and uh

970
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,880
and hopefully get somewhere but that's

971
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,400
kind of the

972
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,720
uh what it's going to take to get uh

973
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,560
into browsers it looks like because um

974
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,720
the the sort of

975
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,880
not encrypted at the

976
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,960
at the level that the browser

977
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,040
would be maintaining the encryption

978
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,359
uh is sort of a non-starter

979
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,760
according to the the web security review

980
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,680
that we saw

981
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:29,960
um

982
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,280
[Music]

983
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,040
the the sort of

984
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,119
uh the apis we're looking at are listed

985
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,000
in the

986
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
multicast community group charter in the

987
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,800
w3c thing i think i had a

988
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,319
link to the github there which has a

989
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,480
link to the page anybody can join that

990
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,800
group by the way it's not restricted to

991
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,040
uh to people whose companies are paying

992
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,400
w3c membership fees and whatnot um

993
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,319
i i should say anybody whose company

994
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,800
permits them there is a contributor

995
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,240
license agreement

996
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,480
but you can as an individual if your

997
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,000
company allows it make a

998
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,079
make a free w3c account and join the

999
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,079
group so please do if you're willing and

1000
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,880
able uh if your company is a member of

1001
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,000
w3c then you might have to get uh

1002
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,720
approval from somebody who's who's sort

1003
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,520
of

1004
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,839
heading up your

1005
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:22,720
participation with w3c but uh for most

1006
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,720
participants that hasn't been too big an

1007
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,760
issue uh i'd love to have uh

1008
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,160
anyone who was interested enough to come

1009
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,920
to this meeting might be interested

1010
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,240
enough to follow this too um i'm

1011
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,920
particularly interested in people who

1012
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,800
would be uh interested in doing the

1013
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,040
testing and uh implementation work as

1014
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,960
that as that progresses

1015
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,800
uh but that'll be a slightly faster

1016
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,440
cadence for updates than the

1017
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,520
then the

1018
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,280
mbondi updates

1019
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,880
so please do participate if you're

1020
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,560
interested there and

1021
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,920
willing to look at the browser work

1022
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400
let's see the uh some of the early

1023
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,920
feedback that we saw from the chat

1024
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,240
insect dispatches uh is suggesting that

1025
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,160
we're probably going to need to have the

1026
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,560
uh the actual protocol proposal

1027
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,000
um so for that we're uh i'm intending to

1028
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,400
start those experiments uh

1029
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,240
you know towards the end of this week

1030
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,520
and uh and to get these uh rolling in

1031
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,359
the in the coming months

1032
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,040
um i'm aiming to do a sort of uh

1033
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,119
something inside quick to fit into web

1034
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,880
transport

1035
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,480
so this would

1036
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,119
very likely be something based on the uh

1037
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,000
on the on the pardo http over quick

1038
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,119
draft

1039
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,359
um

1040
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,680
but uh

1041
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,079
there

1042
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,839
are likely to be some differences with

1043
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,040
that because i want to make sure to

1044
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,760
support datagrams to make it

1045
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,839
such that existing multicast apps can be

1046
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,440
deployed with just the sort of web

1047
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,319
transport shim around them at the at the

1048
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,240
sending side and then received by the

1049
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,280
browser

1050
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,880
that's what i'd i'd like to aim for

1051
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,560
so the doc status

1052
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,599
for

1053
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,480
the mbondiwork i've been

1054
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,200
uh engaged on some uh some internal

1055
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,480
stuff

1056
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,160
uh in my in my day job and on uh

1057
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,000
some of this uh

1058
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
some of this uh you know w3c and and uh

1059
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,319
working out the security stuff

1060
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,440
uh so i've been kind of low activity on

1061
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,359
the drafts that are active here but i

1062
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,079
did do some updates in dorms

1063
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,119
um

1064
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,400
i i

1065
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,760
uh

1066
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,280
when i checked it against the reviews

1067
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,839
i'd had seen uh particularly

1068
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,160
particularly rashad's

1069
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,720
uh as young doctor there was an

1070
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,800
unaddressed comment that i'd left out so

1071
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,119
i added some text to address that

1072
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,079
so i think as of now it's got all the

1073
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,880
um all the updates that people have

1074
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,079
recommended

1075
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,599
if anything

1076
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,040
has been left out that somebody

1077
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,960
mentioned then please do

1078
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,040
let me know if you see it

1079
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,119
it probably would make sense to get at

1080
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,000
least another review if possible um but

1081
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,880
uh

1082
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,720
you know i would love to move this to

1083
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,520
last call uh at some

1084
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,280
point and have that uh

1085
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,920
you know get the

1086
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,160
uh the forward motion that would

1087
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,319
that would uh make the other two that

1088
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,319
build on it uh more

1089
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,160
considered more stable

1090
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,880
um

1091
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,640
likewise the mnat

1092
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,760
uh i got a few comments but nothing

1093
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,440
really um

1094
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,079
telling me to change things i think

1095
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,880
uh and so i would love to get

1096
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,599
uh reviews on that one in particular as

1097
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:52,400
well

1098
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,599
uh ambi i think i'm gonna be um

1099
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,680
i'm gonna be messing with as i work on

1100
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,720
the security stuff so uh

1101
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,800
so if you're looking to hold off on

1102
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,880
something you can hold off on that one

1103
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,119
uh once storms is done then then see

1104
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,280
back would be uh certainly

1105
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,599
a useful one to do as well but

1106
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,520
my priority order

1107
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,800
on reviews if you're willing to do them

1108
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,280
would be dorms and m-net and then uh see

1109
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,640
back and then ambi at this at this stage

1110
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,960
um

1111
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,960
let's see uh the in in m i'll highlight

1112
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,040
dnssd

1113
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,160
uh in particular the um

1114
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,480
the uh

1115
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,599
the search domain portion of that as the

1116
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,119
as the part of the architecture that

1117
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,640
worries me the most

1118
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,480
um because

1119
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,000
it proposes to have a

1120
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,880
a

1121
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,480
mnat server

1122
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,640
that's discoverable by clients inside

1123
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,400
their home networks and

1124
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,880
uh via dns sd

1125
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,480
and this requires

1126
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,359
um

1127
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,880
probably passing the search domain as a

1128
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,599
as a dhcp option into the home network

1129
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,839
which

1130
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,839
i i am not seeing

1131
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,599
uh currently i mean i haven't done a

1132
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,760
wide review but uh currently it

1133
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,760
anecdotally does not seem

1134
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,640
super common that home routers are are

1135
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,440
implementing that functionality today

1136
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,040
um it might be because the service

1137
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,119
providers aren't aren't

1138
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,920
advertising in their dhcp offerings but

1139
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,480
this is a space that that i don't think

1140
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,839
has been

1141
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,760
necessarily that

1142
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,040
that well explored and

1143
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,280
and would bear some um

1144
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,280
some investigation

1145
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,160
uh

1146
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,319
and and possibly alternatives the other

1147
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,240
the main alternative i've been thinking

1148
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,040
about is uh is

1149
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,240
making a dns rr type

1150
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,800
that would describe an sg

1151
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,319
i haven't tried this i haven't started

1152
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:01,920
writing that draft yet but that might be

1153
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,960
a reasonable way to

1154
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,680
to allow a local isp to

1155
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,400
manage the mapping from

1156
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,040
what a client app tries to join

1157
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,400
to a

1158
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,560
a locally addressed

1159
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,359
sg so

1160
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:22,559
that might be a draft that will be

1161
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,280
coming to along this work

1162
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,800
it's more drafts than i was expecting

1163
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,720
when i started

1164
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,800
uh anyway um

1165
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,680
in terms of next steps

1166
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,599
i'd like to consider

1167
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,520
dorm's last call so i'd like to open

1168
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,280
that up for discussion

1169
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,880
now um the other thing i'm going to ask

1170
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,119
for is to put dormancy back and ambi

1171
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,720
into a cluster

1172
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,000
um

1173
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,240
the cluster being so that they can refer

1174
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,839
to one another and would would become

1175
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:55,040
rfc's together or in the order

1176
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,839
and order determined by by their lack of

1177
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,200
loops

1178
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,720
um

1179
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,760
and then

1180
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,960
there are some

1181
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,880
new docs that are going to be relevant

1182
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,839
to this that seem likely to to be on the

1183
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:08,800
way

1184
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,319
due to the security feedback we've

1185
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,480
received

1186
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,319
and it's going to depend on sufficient

1187
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,000
interest

1188
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,240
being demonstrated

1189
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,720
so if you know anybody who is willing to

1190
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,559
talk about this stuff then make sure to

1191
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,000
get them on the list when i send out the

1192
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,480
invitation to join the msec

1193
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,640
or whatever it will be

1194
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,880
uh so with that do please um

1195
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,119
give me any questions or comments that

1196
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,520
you cut

1197
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,079
sandy

1198
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,640
hi hi

1199
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:56,599
i don't hear you yet

1200
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,280
uh sandy you're muted right now

1201
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,960
hello can you hear me now

1202
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,280
yeah no i can hear you great

1203
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,599
okay thank you i i forgot to mute myself

1204
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,760
and i have a question

1205
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,400
about the security multicast

1206
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,440
i'd like to know if the multicast

1207
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,920
multicast security will have some

1208
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,680
affection on the

1209
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,160
transport protocol

1210
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,720
like mrd or pim or

1211
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,359
other things

1212
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,200
uh i wouldn't expect so

1213
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,280
mld and pin

1214
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,040
and beer

1215
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,720
i would expect to be unaffected

1216
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,160
in fact

1217
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,640
i would i would hope that we could even

1218
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,359
consider so the trans the the

1219
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,680
security considerations

1220
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,280
the sort of initial direction that i

1221
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,119
have not yet written down

1222
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,520
uh and is highly subject to change is

1223
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,599
that um

1224
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,559
going to be trying to make a

1225
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,200
a quick version of this that uses a

1226
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,640
symmetric key

1227
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,240
for encryption

1228
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,480
um and maintains the same kind of uh

1229
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,440
out of band the unicast

1230
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,920
based uh secure

1231
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,359
transfer of hashes to do the um

1232
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:34,160
uh

1233
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,920
to do the

1234
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,559
authentication of the data channel of

1235
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,640
the multicast data channel

1236
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,520
um

1237
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,880
and uh

1238
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,839
and the main difference with what it was

1239
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,599
before which was just authenticating

1240
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,680
generic udp packets which may or may not

1241
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,880
be encrypted

1242
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,720
is that the udp packets for this part

1243
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,319
would be uh sort of specified as being

1244
00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:00,240
uh quick encoded with a with a

1245
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,040
with a symmetric encryption key that is

1246
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,760
passed over an associated quick channel

1247
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,640
um

1248
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,520
these

1249
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,880
uh

1250
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,400
the intent is to make it so that um

1251
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,079
so that

1252
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,319
existing udp payloads from outside

1253
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,960
uh from like existing uh

1254
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,520
multicast applications would be possible

1255
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,119
to translate into these uh udp

1256
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,720
uh packets as

1257
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,280
as quick datagrams and be transported

1258
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,520
with multicast that way

1259
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,440
so that the applications themselves even

1260
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,960
legacy applications would not have to

1261
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,880
change at all we'd have to do is run a

1262
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,480
receiver sort of

1263
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,160
inside the sender that would pump out

1264
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,400
the quick packets and the authentication

1265
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,319
hashes and the authentication hashes

1266
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,800
would have to be distributed to the

1267
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,400
to the receivers

1268
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,880
in a much smaller channel than than the

1269
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,720
data channel

1270
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,720
in the same way that ambi works but uh

1271
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,359
in terms of the the transport under udp

1272
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:06,319
um

1273
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:08,880
under the the quick layer of udp uh

1274
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,040
there would be no change um and so

1275
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,559
anything that that works today uh mpls

1276
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:15,520
beer

1277
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,920
pim uh all these things would be

1278
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,480
unaffected

1279
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,240
okay

1280
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,200
i see thank you

1281
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,200
thanks

1282
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,480
one of the pieces of feedback was um

1283
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,400
or a gating factor was

1284
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,960
um and i forget who you mentioned which

1285
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,760
group

1286
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,559
that know that there is a lack of demand

1287
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:47,760
for this

1288
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,720
um

1289
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,880
is that

1290
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,160
is that pertinent from a technical

1291
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,520
standpoint and that seems like a

1292
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,000
subjective discussion uh and and also

1293
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,160
one that would fly in the face of the

1294
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,880
existence theorem that you indeed have

1295
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,880
enough interest to be doing all of this

1296
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,240
um

1297
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,880
so can you so so

1298
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,480
is that a thing can you just say nobody

1299
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,599
wants this so we're not going to do it

1300
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,680
yeah if you can't get enough interest

1301
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,200
then they won't open a working group for

1302
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,160
you in general um

1303
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,760
but uh with that said um the specific

1304
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,359
case

1305
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,839
here was with regard to the multicast

1306
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,079
security um

1307
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:28,800
for

1308
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,280
browsers in particular the main question

1309
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,800
was like well what browsers are going to

1310
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,040
take this they came from ecker he asked

1311
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,040
that both on the list and in the in the

1312
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,000
cube insect dispatch

1313
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,960
and

1314
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,720
made the point that

1315
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,000
i mean yeah i've been talking to some

1316
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,400
chromium people but they're not eager

1317
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,520
for this

1318
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,880
uh and

1319
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,200
seem pretty lukewarm on it

1320
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,119
um

1321
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:55,119
you know i i would i would like to get

1322
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:57,680
some uh counter examples

1323
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,280
to speak up and

1324
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,400
uh

1325
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,319
and and say that

1326
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,240
i mean i think you know

1327
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,440
my response

1328
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,920
to his uh

1329
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,640
to what he said was that well they think

1330
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,160
it's probably not going to work they are

1331
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,480
skeptical of this and and

1332
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,160
this is

1333
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,000
perhaps a justified position based on

1334
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,599
multicast history

1335
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,359
um they want to see

1336
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:22,319
uh

1337
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:23,119
you know

1338
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,119
more people engaged on this before

1339
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:26,559
they're willing to

1340
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,920
to dive in

1341
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,920
i assume um

1342
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,200
and that's some feedback i've gotten

1343
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,040
from others in the in the multicast

1344
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,400
community group

1345
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,880
um so i think increasing engagement

1346
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,640
would really show something worthwhile

1347
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,400
here i i should also maybe mention uh

1348
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,920
you know

1349
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,920
i'm starting to get a little bit more

1350
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,760
traction in this like virgin media

1351
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,000
previously had given us permission to to

1352
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,680
say their name is having been involved

1353
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,799
in our our trials and evaluated the tech

1354
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,040
and uh

1355
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,280
supportive of moving it forward

1356
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,119
um

1357
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,839
since then uh or since last time i've

1358
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:04,720
gotten

1359
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,079
uh so comcast said

1360
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,160
that they would uh they think this makes

1361
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,520
sense for the future

1362
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,640
um

1363
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,200
you know i i rate them

1364
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,680
like they haven't looked at it as deeply

1365
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,400
but they do think that this uh as far as

1366
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,160
i can tell looks promising and they

1367
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,920
would like to see it happen

1368
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,119
um

1369
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,799
likewise uh

1370
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:28,799
i've i've gotten

1371
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:31,520
so dizone sent an email to the list but

1372
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,839
wasn't uh it wasn't forwarded to the

1373
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,680
sexist patch list but i do feel

1374
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,440
comfortable saying

1375
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,760
i i think i will probably be forwarding

1376
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,559
it

1377
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,799
uh but they they also said that they're

1378
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:46,839
supportive of multicast standardization

1379
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:50,640
um amazon also said did give permission

1380
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,640
to say that we'd talk to them and that

1381
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,240
that they would like to see

1382
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,559
uh multicast capabilities happen

1383
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:57,599
in

1384
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:58,319
uh

1385
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,559
news that may or may not be related

1386
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,960
design and amazon uh each individually

1387
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,799
have signed major

1388
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,720
uh major sports

1389
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,160
delivery deals

1390
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,000
uh for the upcoming years in the like

1391
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,599
um you know

1392
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,559
10 billion and 2.7 billion uh dollars in

1393
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,799
euros respectively uh that they've

1394
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,799
publicly announced um

1395
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,040
and uh

1396
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,720
you know

1397
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,000
and suddenly they're interested in

1398
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,079
multicast for some reason or at least

1399
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:32,000
tentatively interested uh so i mean

1400
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,920
you know will it happen

1401
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,760
who knows right but

1402
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,480
um but but these are names that

1403
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,920
that are not nothing

1404
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,680
uh i did not get a chance to say that in

1405
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,680
sex dispatch my time was pretty short

1406
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,240
but um

1407
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,480
but we'll probably be discussing it a

1408
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,960
little more

1409
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,119
i mean you know people can have an

1410
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,440
opinion and have it be wrong

1411
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,599
but also there's not it's true that

1412
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,359
there's not

1413
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:04,480
perhaps sufficient demonstrated interest

1414
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,160
and that's going to have to change in

1415
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,079
order for the working group to really

1416
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,599
happen for the multicast security i

1417
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,559
think

1418
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,319
um you mentioned one of the other um

1419
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:19,359
concerns was integrity um

1420
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,960
does that mean

1421
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,960
is that where you need this you need to

1422
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,319
spin up a

1423
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:25,760
new working group or is that just

1424
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,760
another draft that

1425
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,680
uh so ambi actually

1426
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,280
addresses the integrity and i don't

1427
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,400
think anybody said that it wouldn't work

1428
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:39,040
um i do think that uh if we do open the

1429
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,400
a multicast security focused

1430
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,559
uh working group that it would make

1431
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:47,200
sense to move ambi into that working

1432
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,880
group instead of here

1433
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,839
uh

1434
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:52,400
basically just for the um

1435
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,200
for the sort of security expertise that

1436
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,960
would be bringing to bear on it

1437
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,720
um the original

1438
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,400
uh

1439
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,799
claim when when we

1440
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:04,640
uh

1441
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,280
you know when i talked to a security ad

1442
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,280
and asked whether it would be reasonable

1443
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,000
to to work on it in mbf or whether it

1444
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,520
would require

1445
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,680
another working group in the first place

1446
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,799
uh was that well it's not using any

1447
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,400
you know novel

1448
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,040
uh crypto or authentication approaches

1449
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,319
these are all well proven in other

1450
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:25,520
contexts

1451
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,240
um and so as long as we and it's not

1452
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,559
something that that has like

1453
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,480
uh tricky trade-offs on crypto agility

1454
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,640
we just have a very uh

1455
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,200
you know extensible sort of

1456
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,920
framework for for how to identify which

1457
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,000
algorithms we're talking about via the

1458
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,119
yang model

1459
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,960
um and so the

1460
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,400
you know it's it's

1461
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,160
there's not many concerns on the

1462
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,240
security side with the with what was

1463
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,520
proposed

1464
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,760
but i think having worked on it since

1465
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,559
then um there might be some subtleties

1466
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,359
in like the way the the course model

1467
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,200
works that um

1468
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,119
i'd like to get some more security

1469
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,760
expert eyeballs on really before before

1470
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,599
i'm comfortable with it

1471
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:08,559
um

1472
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:09,359
so

1473
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:11,680
you know and you know that that was also

1474
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,200
part of the advice that we're gonna need

1475
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,400
to have a security uh review of it but i

1476
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,119
do think it it would make better sense

1477
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,359
if there was an existing

1478
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:22,400
msec

1479
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,040
uh working group to live inside the msec

1480
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,960
work uh working group

1481
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,359
uh once it's there so so i i might

1482
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,920
propose moving it if possible at that

1483
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:32,720
time

1484
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,040
um but you know ju that's just a heads

1485
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,280
up for the future there's nothing

1486
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,720
actionable i'm

1487
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,359
suggesting at the moment

1488
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:45,319
besides like making a group

1489
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:47,599
so

1490
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,920
the integrity stuff that's needed is in

1491
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,000
ambi it's just a matter of getting more

1492
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,400
eyeballs on it

1493
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,200
uh yeah it's an ambi uh

1494
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,880
and there might be something very

1495
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,559
similar that would go into the quick

1496
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,640
protocol itself that would be a

1497
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,079
a little more integrated instead of

1498
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,599
purely out of band

1499
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:07,760
um but i think i'm

1500
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,079
gonna do it by just referring to ambi i

1501
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,760
just i need to

1502
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,200
to experiment with that part and

1503
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,799
actually write it and

1504
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:17,759
and write it up

1505
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:20,559
so that's that's kind of tbd but yes the

1506
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:24,160
the integrity approach outlined in andy

1507
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,640
as far as i know is

1508
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,880
is looking like it's going to do the job

1509
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,680
for integrity

1510
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,720
great thanks any other questions for

1511
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,720
jake

1512
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,240

behalf of uh

1535
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,599
association which is the pan-european

1536
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:58,000
company

1537
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,440
managing the pan-european network so

1538
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,920
we are here today to talk about an

1539
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,559
exciting project we have started

1540
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:09,119
in 2019

1541
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,760
which is related to implement a

1542
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,079
routine stack based on

1543
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:16,240
various data

1544
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,558
next

1545
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:22,640
so this is the the agenda uh

1546
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,720
very uh quickly

1547
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,280
we will explain what is the rar free

1548
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,720
router project

1549
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,599
um

1550
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:31,119
the lessons learned

1551
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:33,680
um regarding brfc

1552
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,119
implementation

1553
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:37,440
the the first br experiment that has

1554
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,799
been launched in

1555
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:40,319
2017

1556
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:43,599
and that has been completed in 2021

1557
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:44,400
um

1558
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,039
the next point is the amt

1559
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:53,200
relay implementation based on rfc 7450

1560
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,000
and

1561
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,640
since today we have a we have a very

1562
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,799
very

1563
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,839
exciting br combined to int

1564
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:03,680
implementation experiment that you you

1565
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,440
can

1566
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,680
that you can test by yourself

1567
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,839
and listen uh the the

1568
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:12,319
the hunger and harvard music and a bit

1569
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:16,119
of conclusion next

1570
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,200
so basically what is the the r project

1571
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,760
um it's essentially uh combining three

1572
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,000
uh components which is the control plane

1573
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
uh multiple data planes

1574
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,559
and create a specific interface between

1575
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,520
each data plane and the control plane so

1576
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,200
so the goal is to have one familiar

1577
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,200
platform that is able to propose

1578
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,280
multiple solutions and each solution

1579
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,880
will address

1580
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,079
specific

1581
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,480
research and education use case

1582
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,680
and

1583
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,960
the

1584
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,000
the the fun part is that uh multicast is

1585
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,160
one of this use case next

1586
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,720
so for now we we we have multiple data

1587
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:00,480
planes based on p4 we have the vm v2

1588
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,920
target which is the virtual p4 switch

1589
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,720
where you can train yourself and look at

1590
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,520
the r free router code we have an

1591
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,760
implementation for tofino which is

1592
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,240
basically essentially the same uh the

1593
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,680
same code base

1594
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,359
except the fact that you you will see

1595
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:19,920
more um uh pragma

1596
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,960
uh restraining uh features because the

1597
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:27,359
the ace the tofino asic is of course not

1598
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,119
unlimited in terms of resource compared

1599
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,960
to a virtual switch

1600
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,920
we are looking at fpgas

1601
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,760
and which will come

1602
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,599
soon next year

1603
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:38,839
we have

1604
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:43,520
a backup tcp damper library and also a

1605
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,359
dpdk

1606
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:48,160
we have some discussion with um

1607
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,319
in order to pro to provide the npa

1608
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:51,599
letterplane

1609
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:54,599
next

1610
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:58,319
so how do we test the the the code uh

1611
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:01,440
essentially we we have deployed uh for a

1612
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,760
set of four nodes in in in europe

1613
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,559
amsterdam frankfurt budapest and poison

1614
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:09,119
and um so far we

1615
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,359
we attracted some attention to various

1616
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:14,319
organizations from around the world and

1617
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,720
now we we are pleased to welcome more

1618
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,000
nodes in

1619
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,039
north america and south america we'll

1620
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:24,079
have some new nerds in um in indonesia

1621
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:26,319
in korea for example

1622
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:29,920
but uh and all of this corresponds to a

1623
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,200
beer uh an entire beer domain that that

1624
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,640
is spread

1625
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,160
onto the the p4 lab

1626
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,319
now i think uh it's about the floors is

1627
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:42,559
yours

1628
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:45,839
ah okay so uh what we have

1629
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:47,920
so first of all

1630
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,480
we introduced beer in mpnshank

1631
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,440
observation that is this rfc

1632
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,720
um

1633
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,880
basically in software mode that was the

1634
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,039
first that happened and then i started

1635
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,839
to experiment with my whole network uh

1636
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:03,680
with the beer be

1637
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:08,079
how can it transmit my my frequently

1638
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:10,480
broadcast music sessions

1639
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,400
and uh

1640
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,240
this is this is what we mentioned that

1641
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:17,119
the the building started in

1642
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:18,760
in

1643
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,720
2017 or or about about the time then

1644
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,119
when this refc became public

1645
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:28,880
um for for this to happen uh we did

1646
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,200
obviously the interior gateway protocols

1647
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,000
to to have the the beer

1648
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
load index and the b mpls labor base um

1649
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,319
flooded within the domains so this is

1650
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:43,680
via b right size extension and b ospf

1651
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,400
extension as a

1652
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,280
started to appear in inframatter this is

1653
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,559
uh again the same 2017

1654
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:54,480
when it happened

1655
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,200
this is the point where i would

1656
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:01,200
call you if if you if you uh implement

1657
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,920
a networking operating system and uh and

1658
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,000
you would like to and and you have beer

1659
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,599
and would like to do some

1660
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:09,839
interoperability testings then uh

1661
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:11,119
feel free to

1662
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:14,079
contact us we are we are very happy to

1663
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:16,960
do some hacking with you um the thing is

1664
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,520
that beerus spf extension have already

1665
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,359
uh interrupt tested

1666
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:24,400
uh with isis extensions uh

1667
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,640
fortunately the viral shark

1668
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,240
decoded it

1669
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,280
very well

1670
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,280
but uh not yet

1671
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,520
tested in interrupt

1672
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,640
times

1673
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,240
uh regarding the beer bgp draft it is

1674
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,880
also supported uh since the beginning

1675
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,520
when it when it started to appear it is

1676
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,760
uh it is basically when you when you

1677
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,640
send the prefix then uh you cannot touch

1678
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,000
a beer attribute to it then that

1679
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,440
prefix will behave as as it's

1680
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:57,920
s as it saw in the in the igp domains

1681
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,640
with uh with the b index that is uh you

1682
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,559
can uh

1683
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,559
and you can

1684
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:06,480
send multicast

1685
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,160
pockets to that uh

1686
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,799
that prefix or or parts of the prefix

1687
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:11,760
and uh

1688
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:12,880
and

1689
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,079
that

1690
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:15,440
that will happen in beer and

1691
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,198
constellation in this case

1692
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:20,158
also we support the um the requisite

1693
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:22,799
version of this that is you get a prefix

1694
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:25,920
without would be uh attribute but uh but

1695
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,640
the underling uh root have a beer index

1696
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,679
then

1697
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:32,238
the pockets uh also we sent in in the

1698
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:33,600
rank of selection

1699
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,759
and and the last thing that we we

1700
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,679
support with beer

1701
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:40,640
things that is a appear at this p in a

1702
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,439
in a b rank of session it is uh needed

1703
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:45,120
for me just because

1704
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,799
this is how i i am with cast my uh my

1705
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:52,719
music in the so-called global table

1706
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:56,560
and last but not least this year we we

1707
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,120
as we started discussing with uh with

1708
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:02,000
andy and and and the guys from uh

1709
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,839
juniper then he added the empty

1710
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:06,399
functionality

1711
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:08,399
that is uh we have two

1712
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:11,679
different parts and we have the amtv and

1713
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:13,679
also the anti-gateway

1714
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:16,880
which also tested for interrupt with the

1715
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,679
video rank you know the erc

1716
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:22,319
and uh and also with the

1717
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:23,520
public

1718
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,359
amt rays that are provided by uh

1719
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,439
provided by various universities in the

1720
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,040
states and as far as i know they are

1721
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,439
running uh

1722
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:40,719
here that we have

1723
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:43,279
are tested regularly

1724
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:48,600
over ipv4 and ipv6 addresses

1725
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:51,600
expirement

1726
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,000
so basically as i said

1727
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,480
i am running a small home network with

1728
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,718
some

1729
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,040
25 or so nodes and

1730
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,880
and then all are

1731
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,199
participating in the beer domain

1732
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:09,360
which is now uh since last year

1733
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,719
connected to the

1734
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:13,679
b4 test that frederick mentioned before

1735
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:15,600
and the main difference between the two

1736
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,400
is that my local

1737
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,719
whole network is mostly running on tpd

1738
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:22,800
credit appearance uh

1739
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,880
via the

1740
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,920
p4 test but the adjunct is running on

1741
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,600
hardware-based switches

1742
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,120
and

1743
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,480
since there are still it is

1744
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,440
cross-connected uh with uh

1745
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,960
cross-connected

1746
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,400
and we are doing uh inter uh

1747
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,000
entry as uh

1748
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,640
beer set up between them

1749
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,400
since that time

1750
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,719
other other prefixes are also exchanged

1751
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:50,800
but there are some

1752
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,719
at least one prefix that have been

1753
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:55,520
indexed sent from my network and this is

1754
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,320
how at the moment the p4 tests that have

1755
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,600
a constant multicast rule

1756
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,000
uh you can you can check various

1757
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,480
states of my home network links on this

1758
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,440
page

1759
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,600
and uh

1760
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,800
directly

1761
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,120
one of the regular uh

1762
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,280
broadcasts of my office music is is

1763
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,520
recorded on this

1764
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,159
video on this demo link which which is

1765
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:21,760
uh basically

1766
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:25,520
a unique hosted video at the moment but

1767
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,920
it is showing you that uh when i when i

1768
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,000
press the play button then then what

1769
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,320
happens is in the network so

1770
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,120
i show you that uh the end nodes start

1771
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:38,400
the igmp this is a triggered by the vrc

1772
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:42,239
startup then it it get

1773
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:43,760
sent through the

1774
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,719
beer core within a beam uh anc

1775
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,560
observation this is the

1776
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,719
pier beam this is the pmb

1777
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:53,760
interrupt and uh and all these multicast

1778
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,760
pockets within the core are transmitted

1779
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,600
in in a beer

1780
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,320
at the moment

1781
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,360
and

1782
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,320
and since we have uh the dpdk data plane

1783
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,719
i think it is it is two years old now

1784
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:10,239
then since then

1785
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,480
all this happens within the dpdk

1786
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,560
replication here

1787
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:15,760
and uh

1788
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:20,000
this uh whole network is connected to um

1789
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:20,840
to

1790
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:23,360
public accessible uh

1791
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:27,760
amtv uh this is uh the last line uh how

1792
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,719
you can start vrc to uh to use that am

1793
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,120
tv and then you can listen through the

1794
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,840
integrated uh

1795
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,159
my my alcohol music which is streaming

1796
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:39,199
uh

1797
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:40,560
basically

1798
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,679
always

1799
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:43,920
and

1800
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,239
that's it

1801
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:49,239
um

1802
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,960
guys do you see the terminal yes yes

1803
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,880
so two things that i would like to show

1804
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,080
you here is uh one part that is the emt

1805
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,120
uh

1806
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,719
gateway at the moment

1807
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,280
uh i have started it uh with the roka

1808
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,120
router that uh

1809
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,880
that i spawn up and when the meeting

1810
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,760
started it's basically uh

1811
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,280
at the moment this very very stupid

1812
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,960
configuration it points a default

1813
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,800
multicast through to

1814
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,640
to to a random address which is on the

1815
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,320
tunnel interface

1816
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,120
and tries to join that multicast group

1817
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,840
which is sent out obviously through the

1818
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,000
through this next hope which is on the

1819
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,480
tunnel interface basically it points to

1820
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,280
the

1821
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:42,320
just interviews

1822
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,040
and the triangle this

1823
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,040
this is where the amt pockets are sent

1824
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,679
this is weaving at the moment and the

1825
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,840
forwarding vrf this is where the deck

1826
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,840
oscillated multicasts are handled this

1827
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,560
is the v2 vrf at the moment

1828
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,719
and

1829
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,520
the things that i would like to show you

1830
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,280
here that is interesting

1831
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,960
when i when i showed the multicast

1832
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,360
routine v to vrf for the given group

1833
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,880
then

1834
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,120
the pockets and and the bytes are

1835
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,480
increasing

1836
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,080
uh slowly

1837
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,120
and this is uh this is a constant

1838
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,120
stream here

1839
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:26,239
not too much on this node to show you

1840
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:29,040
because this is just an empty uh

1841
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,640
gateway a local gateway that can

1842
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,280
decapsulate an amt stream and uh

1843
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:36,000
um basically it can it can handle the

1844
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,560
multicast pockets to the local lawn

1845
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,040
receivers if there are any

1846
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,080
moment

1847
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,520
it is just

1848
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,360
receiving the pockets and then discards

1849
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,159
them

1850
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:48,320
so not too much

1851
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:51,170
to show here this is the server part

1852
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:54,279
[Music]

1853
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,159
and this is how an amt

1854
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:01,280
an amt relay that is

1855
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,520
configured in free router some basic

1856
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,840
security things that we added uh

1857
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,199
just today

1858
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:09,679
uh to other only eight clients from a

1859
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:12,000
subnet a total of

1860
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,880
256 listeners at all

1861
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:15,600
and

1862
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,600
some access some creative meetings on

1863
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,440
the new terminals and and loads dropped

1864
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,600
to drop the attempts

1865
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,640
finally an interface to bind to and uh

1866
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,719
and the vr have to bind to and an

1867
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:31,199
interface that you can uh that that will

1868
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:34,719
be cloned for all the clients

1869
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,679
this interface is the points toward the

1870
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:39,310
integrands that are

1871
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:41,440
[Music]

1872
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:45,520
the starting emt sessions at the same tv

1873
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,239
uh dummy app address here and access

1874
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:50,320
group to only accept

1875
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:54,560
igmp pockets viva stream multicast igmp

1876
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,120
here and the same for v6

1877
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,159
the same for v6

1878
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,400
and

1879
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,880
after after all these things

1880
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,120
at the moment this client is connected

1881
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,239
here so this is why i have an amt

1882
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:12,000
access interface cloned from the

1883
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,600
template here

1884
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,760
so

1885
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:19,040
and also the multicast group operate

1886
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,440
here with the

1887
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,000
with one interface is uh

1888
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,239
on on the outgoing interface list

1889
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,480
and also the pockets and the bytes are

1890
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,159
increasing on the group

1891
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:34,400
it have it have an ingress interface

1892
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,760
here which is uh um which is a beer in a

1893
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,560
bird interface

1894
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:42,800
sorry

1895
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,400
but i can show you the

1896
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,520
and the npr's forwarding

1897
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,360
counters

1898
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,600
so this is uh this is how it looks like

1899
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,560
and you can spot that it is extras in

1900
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,880
bites and it increases

1901
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,280
if we if we take a closer look on this

1902
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,880
river then

1903
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,520
it is uh it's basically an ospf v4pr

1904
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,960
label

1905
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:12,000
uh it did not sent out at all um

1906
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,400
and it is a beer local b string which is

1907
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,520
our

1908
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,800
beer index expressed in in the in the

1909
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,600
beer b string here

1910
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,760
and

1911
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:28,960
we have some peels on this uh on this

1912
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,480
beer

1913
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,880
label basically they are the same

1914
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,239
they are the they are the different

1915
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:37,199
nodes in the in the igp domain

1916
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,760
and they are expressed

1917
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,320
with these b strings uh as you can see

1918
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:47,040
we we have two routing interfaces here

1919
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,199
and also the pockets and the bytes are

1920
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:51,120
increasing

1921
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,520
okay i think that's that's from the demo

1922
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,800
part let's see what else we have

1923
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,800
um

1924
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:05,600
yes sir

1925
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,159
sorry again i was muted

1926
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:10,000
so just to

1927
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,239
let you know that

1928
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:15,360
in terms of status we we are in a very

1929
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,080
good position

1930
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,480
knowing that we started in 2019

1931
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,239
we are now in the in the

1932
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:26,560
in the situation where we we need to to

1933
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,280
calibrate all profiles so uh if we want

1934
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,159
to have a pure p router uh we have to

1935
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,480
calibrate it in order to fit uh most of

1936
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,120
the uh to find a baseline that would fit

1937
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,600
off the most of the use case in the in

1938
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,960
in our research institution customer or

1939
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,560
organization

1940
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:47,600
and uh of course br is a multicast

1941
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,640
profile and beer profile is a must-have

1942
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,120
because we have some users who have a

1943
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,440
multicast enable application

1944
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,440
and and this is um

1945
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,679
why we think that it's it's really great

1946
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:03,199
because this uh this p4 lab is giving us

1947
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:05,440
a way to to be ahead in terms of

1948
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,800
innovation and new implementation and uh

1949
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,880
just to let you know that you are free

1950
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:15,120
to test this amt relay that is public uh

1951
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,080
you have

1952
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,480
uh club amateur showed you the the link

1953
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,719
and we can of course

1954
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:23,199
share the link with the

1955
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:24,480
domain list

1956
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,280
um

1957
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,280
the good news is that uh we are we are

1958
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:30,480
we are we can use this uh fifa app to to

1959
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,239
validate two things uh the first

1960
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:33,840
solution of the program was to to

1961
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,800
provide a way to link users to multicast

1962
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,040
feed which is the role of the interior

1963
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,080
but

1964
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,480
we think we think that we can solve the

1965
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,400
other problem which is

1966
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,400
tying new source adding new source to

1967
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,679
this multicast platform so that

1968
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,199
we can solve the other part of the

1969
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:53,760
program which we which is also which

1970
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,560
will provide an end-to-end path to the

1971
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:00,320
uh source toward the the the receivers

1972
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,239
and that's that would be great because

1973
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:02,960
um

1974
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,440
we really think that this

1975
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,639
i wouldn't say a cost effective solution

1976
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:10,480
for multicast but

1977
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,639
just to know that this runs in in an

1978
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:15,440
overlay in an overlay

1979
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:18,400
on top of a real network is a very great

1980
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,400
asset to to provide

1981
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,080
maybe a new way to provide multicast

1982
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,239
services that is totally independent and

1983
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:27,120
safe in terms of operation operational

1984
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,679
point of view

1985
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,040
and this is uh also i think back in the

1986
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,560
time when i was working in the

1987
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,560
engineering team it was a

1988
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,719
kind of scary to activate multicast

1989
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:40,480
because at some point you you you don't

1990
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:41,920
know if you can geoparadise some

1991
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,800
resources from your backbone and not in

1992
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,280
this case this is totally not the case

1993
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,920
we are free to to exploit uh to explore

1994
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,280
new to new um new solution and uh

1995
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,600
feel free to to to reach us and i'm not

1996
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,760
sure sub i should have the link to the

1997
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,840
to the current uh

1998
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,960
world map

1999
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,239
yes i have

2000
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:07,040
can you can you hear

2001
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,760
so here this is the the the lab

2002
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,920
that is a spawn in

2003
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,600
in europe of course

2004
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,320
but if you look at the west part we have

2005
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,840
we start we have start we are starting

2006
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,560
to have new nerds in the uh in the us on

2007
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,760
the west coast and

2008
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,800
north america and in latin america and

2009
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,440
we will leverage a new submarines cable

2010
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,440
in an entrepreneurial capacity but just

2011
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,760
to let you know that all of this is a br

2012
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,280
domain that

2013
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,520
that can be used for testing

2014
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,560
and also one very good point is that um

2015
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,840
if you are implementing a client

2016
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:44,880
um

2017
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,320
we have this br domain is ipv6 enabled

2018
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,159
so this means that you can

2019
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:52,560
implement your ipv6

2020
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,480
int client

2021
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,960
and test it against this before lab if

2022
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,280
you don't have a specific value to test

2023
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,360
it

2024
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:05,040
and i think that's pretty much about it

2025
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,679
thank you any questions

2026
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:15,520
any questions

2027
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,199
jake

2028
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,760
yeah that is uh very cool guys uh nice

2029
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:26,719
work

2030
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:28,960
um

2031
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,880
so these there's a couple of mailing

2032
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,960
lists you mentioned i think are these

2033
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,760
for uh

2034
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,440
is there a

2035
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,360
what a charter or purpose for these

2036
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,320
mailing lists like i'm not i'm not clear

2037
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,239
i'm interested in following this work

2038
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:47,920
i'm not clear which is exactly the right

2039
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:49,199
one

2040
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:50,800
that i should sign up for

2041
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,960
uh i think i'm i think i'm on at least

2042
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,280
one already uh but i'm not sure if if

2043
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,679
that's uh for uh

2044
01:22:57,679 --> 01:22:59,120
but i'm not sure

2045
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:00,880
yeah sorry i wasn't clear you are

2046
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,960
already on the on the multicast

2047
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,960
that is between

2048
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,560
us but um

2049
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,719
i i was mentioning the

2050
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:10,560
the mbondio

2051
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,000
mailing list

2052
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,719
so people can freely test it

2053
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:16,719
get used to it and approach it discuss

2054
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:18,560
with us how we can improve things

2055
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,159
because for sure there are things to

2056
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:24,719
improve uh security encryption or

2057
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:26,800
new

2058
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,920
number of

2059
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,600
parallel client

2060
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,000
and the good news is that we this mt

2061
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,840
really has a 10 gig connection toward

2062
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,600
the follow

2063
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:38,800
and we should we hope that soon we'll uh

2064
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,040
move to 100 gig so we can have a very

2065
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,960
tremendous uh

2066
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,159
toy

2067
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:46,560
to play with and uh and the good news is

2068
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,800
that the more client we test

2069
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,199
the more interoperable it will be

2070
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:53,600
and even for you it's a

2071
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,679
it's a win-win situation so if you are a

2072
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:57,600
pure vlc developer i would like to

2073
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,560
create an ipv6 vlc client

2074
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,120
feel free to reach us it's for you

2075
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,199
just let us know sometimes there will be

2076
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:07,040
breakage and so on but

2077
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:07,760
uh

2078
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,920
it's um it's here for

2079
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:13,679
to for everyone to um to progress

2080
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,080
on the contrary we can add new we can

2081
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,320
think about how to to bind new source

2082
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,159
into this platform

2083
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:23,040
even if it is an experimental platform

2084
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,400
but in the end

2085
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,320
the idea would be to solve this problem

2086
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,920
where we we

2087
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:31,520
we bind the source and the receivers

2088
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:32,560
and

2089
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,080
after that we will give you all the

2090
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,639
recipes to create your own platform

2091
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:38,639
in your own company whatever

2092
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:40,800
with your favorite hardware

2093
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:41,600
and

2094
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,600
that's pretty much about it

2095
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,679
that's that's outstanding uh do you have

2096
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:49,679
a sort of timeline in mind for um

2097
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:52,000
for when you'll be ingesting external

2098
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,760
traffic

2099
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,320
and uh and is that is that gonna be

2100
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:01,360
using the uh the sort of amt and uh

2101
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,440
and dryad solution or is that going to

2102
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,280
be or did you have something else in

2103
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:06,560
mind

2104
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,960
and for the empty

2105
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,679
the second empty in the p4 that was just

2106
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:14,719
started but as as i showcased in the

2107
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:17,199
demo uh we have the empty gateway

2108
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:19,600
functionality that can uh pull traffic

2109
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,280
from uh from an existing gmt relay

2110
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:24,239
and uh

2111
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,639
as i saw and uh on the

2112
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:28,800
m2m uh

2113
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,560
i cannot recall so there is a public

2114
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:31,920
list where

2115
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,320
there are some uh some interesting feeds

2116
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:38,719
uh i think a a nasa video with 8k and

2117
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:40,639
and some other universities from the

2118
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:44,320
states which are accessible through ent

2119
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,360
i i played a bit back in time with them

2120
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,080
and noticed that internet2 has shut down

2121
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,960
its um services so basically

2122
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,639
we have three today's

2123
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:56,560
uh behind the the

2124
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,440
domain that that is the amtv

2125
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,760
and and some sources are reachable

2126
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,600
through one gateway and i'm sorry one

2127
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,000
really and the other source is behind

2128
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,400
otherwise but i uh

2129
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,199
so this urgent entv is just started

2130
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:14,480
today but i i have plans to to populate

2131
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:17,840
some some static tumors to these uh

2132
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,719
these uh public other emt rays and and

2133
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:23,600
they have a constant uh constant feed

2134
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,840
feed from them and and make them

2135
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,639
available in into the giant multicast

2136
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:30,719
network because the more more streams

2137
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:33,600
then we are we are more happy

2138
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,600
so so in summary yes we have we have

2139
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,000
plans but uh i think it will happen in

2140
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,040
in the upcoming days

2141
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:44,080
okay great uh um i i may

2142
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,880
uh open a throat on the mailing list to

2143
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,800
talk a little bit about the the dns

2144
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,120
based discovery mechanism and whether

2145
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,280
that would be feasible for you as well

2146
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,560
uh thank you

2147
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:57,600
that that that perfect uh one thing that

2148
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,639
we would also like to to to focus on is

2149
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:02,560
of course there is a technology aspect

2150
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,360
where

2151
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,760
you of course all of us

2152
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,239
are technical people and we can

2153
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:11,040
find and understand things but the real

2154
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:14,080
uh idea that would like to achieve in

2155
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,520
the end is to

2156
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,840
achieve something really brain dead

2157
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,320
simple i would say that receivers and

2158
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,280
source

2159
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:22,800
should not know all of these

2160
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:26,320
complexities or should work instantly

2161
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,719
and uh

2162
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:31,199
and this is the difficulty

2163
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:33,280
technically complex but make things

2164
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,760
simple for users so that they just don't

2165
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,679
think about using anything else i will

2166
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:39,760
just go this way because it's simple and

2167
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,000
it works and this is the the idea of

2168
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,360
this whole

2169
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,639
entropy that is that we are trying to to

2170
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:48,719
to buy

2171
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:50,320
that's exactly what i want to talk about

2172
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,960
yeah so uh we'll we'll take that up uh

2173
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,199
offline but i'll just say uh take a look

2174
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:57,679
at rfc 8777

2175
01:27:57,679 --> 01:27:58,800
and uh

2176
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,480
we'll talk we'll talk some more thank

2177
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,638
you

2178
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,320
i think maybe you wanted to say

2179
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,639
something

2180
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:12,239
yeah i got my

2181
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:13,760
hand up um

2182
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,760
yeah it's it comes it does come back to

2183
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,360
content you're absolutely right at the

2184
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,520
moment there's very little multicast

2185
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,280
content in the research and education

2186
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:22,719
networks there's a project called eu

2187
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:24,000
metsat

2188
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,719
um which is

2189
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:28,560
meteorological related

2190
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,080
data that's

2191
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,800
multicast we looked on our uk

2192
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,560
network janet and it's pretty much only

2193
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,120
you met sat traffic that's multicast

2194
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,280
um that's pretty much it there's

2195
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,880
nothing else really

2196
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,560
and as you said internet too have taken

2197
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,560
a didn't want to take the decision but

2198
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:45,600
at the moment they don't have a

2199
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,120
multicast service because of the way

2200
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,880
they're transitioning to new

2201
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,639
a new platform they'll reinstate it

2202
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:51,840
later

2203
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,760
so it's it's currently multicast is a

2204
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,719
bit of a

2205
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:57,040
second class citizen for most things so

2206
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,719
anything we can do as you say to make it

2207
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:01,600
easier uh would be great so i think what

2208
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,520
we're looking to probably do with rare

2209
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,600
in this multicast work is to find ways

2210
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,520
of allowing people just to stream even

2211
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:08,239
from

2212
01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:10,000
you know bandwidth challenged areas so

2213
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,159
they can stream out and reach multiple

2214
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:13,199
people

2215
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:16,480
by automatically um multicasting from

2216
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,800
that single stream that they're sending

2217
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,719
out and making it transparent to them as

2218
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:22,239
far as possible

2219
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:25,920
um so yeah but yeah multicast is is not

2220
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,760
in a particularly happy state in rna

2221
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:31,639
networks which is unfortunate

2222
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:44,560
any other uh any other questions

2223
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,800
um

2224
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:52,880
uh saba i have a question for you um

2225
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,280
what was your experience uh

2226
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,040
in

2227
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,239
implementing

2228
01:29:58,239 --> 01:29:59,920
amt

2229
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:00,800
um

2230
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,719
how much did you know about it before

2231
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:04,400
did you just pick up the spec was it

2232
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,880
really easy was it clear

2233
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:11,120
did it take months or weeks or hours

2234
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:15,760
um so basically um i i i first heard i

2235
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,360
think from you

2236
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,800
about the ant

2237
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,440
this d-spring then i i did a lot of

2238
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,600
other things and

2239
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,760
the first the first reading and and the

2240
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,600
first impression

2241
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,000
was not uh wasn't too positive here

2242
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,199
because i

2243
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:34,000
whereas i am i am thinking about end of

2244
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,159
sedations and tuning like

2245
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:38,239
like pokemon so catching them all is is

2246
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:39,840
always good but uh

2247
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,800
uh but this uh this kind uh to tune a

2248
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,440
multicast

2249
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:47,760
multicast

2250
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:48,880
didn't

2251
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:49,840
didn't

2252
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,960
get too much laugh here but then we had

2253
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,199
some chats with freak and

2254
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:57,120
and mentioned that okay that we should

2255
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,199
catch this book cable also

2256
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:01,440
so afterwards i started reading the

2257
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:02,480
recipe

2258
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:06,080
uh initially i i also didn't found the

2259
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,560
the needed parts for me so i i started

2260
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,719
doing the whole one which is very rare

2261
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:12,960
here i usually

2262
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,719
have the idea

2263
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:17,520
and and uh i only see for the pocket

2264
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,600
headers in the rfc

2265
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,159
but then we pointed out that okay they

2266
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:24,400
are also there but i have to scroll down

2267
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,280
a lot

2268
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,840
at this point at that point uh

2269
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,400
so about two or three days passed with

2270
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,520
with reading the refse and and cast the

2271
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:37,600
the the idea behind it afterwards uh it

2272
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,480
it was uh some hours because uh adding a

2273
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,880
new general language is not too hard

2274
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,960
here

2275
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:45,920
then i

2276
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:49,280
at that point i i was able to um to see

2277
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:51,760
the multicast streams from from internet

2278
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,639
to i mean from the universities of in

2279
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:55,600
states

2280
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:56,639
and then

2281
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:59,520
holding the empty also again

2282
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,840
some hours having them in data players

2283
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,280
uh was about

2284
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,760
another three or two so basically a week

2285
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,880
was

2286
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,080
after i

2287
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,520
i could

2288
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:10,960
i got

2289
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,520
the motivation to read diversity

2290
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:14,880
and

2291
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:15,520
it

2292
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,560
i didn't found any any uh

2293
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,239
issues i mean

2294
01:32:20,239 --> 01:32:24,839
it was easy business of the reverses

2295
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,120
it's uh very helpful feedback from this

2296
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:30,560
group since uh

2297
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:33,360
it's good it's good to know that um

2298
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,760
um that this doc was uh

2299
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,159
that the spec was useful for you so

2300
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:40,800
um thank you

2301
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,840
and this is really great great stuff um

2302
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,800
uh frederick

2303
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,120
um just to um

2304
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,960
to to come to um

2305
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:54,400
to conclude i i just would like to to um

2306
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,040
to hammer the fact that this this lab is

2307
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,159
uh

2308
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:02,239
is open to anyone uh who want to improve

2309
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:05,040
their imt client

2310
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,199
v4 v6 so

2311
01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:09,920
we are now in the situation where we we

2312
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:11,600
we need very good clients so we can

2313
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,000
demonstrate things so whether into uh

2314
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,880
using a browser or vlc or whatever

2315
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,159
whatever um

2316
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:20,159
really if you are really i'm comfortable

2317
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:23,760
with a empty client software development

2318
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,800
uh feel free to to really um

2319
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,760
to to join to contact us and we we can

2320
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,320
open this uh of course uh it's already

2321
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,159
open but we where we can make sure that

2322
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:37,280
it's available for you

2323
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,040
i think the other thing we did discuss

2324
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,480
before this meeting was whether we might

2325
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,159
have some form of hackathon and we had

2326
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:44,719
some ideas that we discussed with jake

2327
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:45,840
and

2328
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,760
many and others so maybe we can try and

2329
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:51,480
focus on some useful hackathon

2330
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:56,159
4113 that focuses on these things

2331
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,400
great any other questions for um saba

2332
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:05,480
and frederick

2333
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:08,000
cool

2334
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,440
well thank you very much guys this is

2335
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:12,000
really really interesting stuff and uh

2336
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,520
the combination of beer and amt is is um

2337
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:17,840
you know potentially really powerful so

2338
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:18,639
um

2339
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:21,120
very very neat very useful stuff and

2340
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,600
um for the

2341
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,360
next section i'm actually going to do a

2342
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:28,320
demo that hopefully addresses

2343
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,960
well it's it's it's an attempt in the

2344
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:34,080
direction of making

2345
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,719
of improving

2346
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:39,280
source content

2347
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,519
so

2348
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:45,199
let me share my screen

2349
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:47,839
yes

2350
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:23,800
let's try this again here

2351
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:35,920
all right

2352
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:38,400
can everyone see

2353
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,960
powerpoint

2354
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,400
um

2355
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:45,280
i need to swap displays how about now

2356
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,719
often it's sourcing for multicast

2357
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:48,480
streams is this what you can say

2358
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:52,480
yep you can see it all right cool

2359
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:56,239
all right so um this is a project um

2360
01:35:56,239 --> 01:35:57,119
that

2361
01:35:57,119 --> 01:35:59,360
we had some um some interns this summer

2362
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:01,679
work on um so what is off net sourcing

2363
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:04,239
so um today

2364
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:06,080
uh there's native sourcing and it's been

2365
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:07,440
around for you know more than two

2366
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,600
decades on the mbo and the multicast

2367
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,280
enabled part of the internet

2368
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:14,239
um and we can call that you know onnet

2369
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:16,960
um but you know the mbone is a very

2370
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,560
small fraction of the internet what and

2371
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:20,000
and and

2372
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,960
um you know what amt does is it allows

2373
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:24,800
off net receiving so

2374
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,400
if you're not on the multicast enabled

2375
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:28,400
network you can access multicast content

2376
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,719
through an amt tunnel you can receive

2377
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:32,080
but what if you wanted to do the same

2378
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,560
what if you wanted to source um and and

2379
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,239
the fact is most sources could

2380
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:37,760
potentially be on

2381
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,520
unicast only networks

2382
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,719
um

2383
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:42,880
so we have a you know an interesting

2384
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,400
portal for discovering and launching um

2385
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:47,920
off net receiving and that is the

2386
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:49,440
multicast menu

2387
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:50,639
um

2388
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:53,199
often at sourcing uh

2389
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:55,280
this is where um

2390
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:58,159
users on unicast only numbers can stream

2391
01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:00,159
uh some type of

2392
01:37:00,159 --> 01:37:01,920
stream say video

2393
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,520
to a translator

2394
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,040
that's sitting on the m bone and that

2395
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,119
converts the stream from unicast to

2396
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:08,320
multicast

2397
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,719
then it can be accessed the idea is to

2398
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:11,840
access it

2399
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:14,000
natively for on-net receivers as well as

2400
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,400
amt for off net receivers

2401
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:17,840
this is kind of how it would work how it

2402
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,600
would look we have the the big-i

2403
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:20,639
internet

2404
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:23,199
um that's you know mostly unicast only

2405
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:25,280
we have the m-bone the multicast enabled

2406
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:27,679
part of it um

2407
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:30,560
mostly rna networks uh and you have a

2408
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,159
multicast source and a multicast

2409
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:34,480
receiver that works the way it's always

2410
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,480
worked now what if you have an off net

2411
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,080
receiver somebody on a unicast only

2412
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:39,520
network who wants to receive well we

2413
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,000
have these amt relays send it natively

2414
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,400
to the relay and then the relay will

2415
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:47,600
send it over amt to receivers

2416
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,840
on unicast only networks

2417
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:52,800
but what if you have an off net source

2418
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:53,679
and

2419
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:55,920
now we're introducing this unicast

2420
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,239
multicast translator

2421
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:01,040
which will take a unicast stream in

2422
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:02,960
uh

2423
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:06,320
turn it into multicast and spit it out

2424
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:10,560
to um native or off net receivers

2425
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,960
um so this translator was developed it's

2426
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,600
essentially a python script

2427
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,239
that translates just very simply

2428
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:20,639
translates um a unicast stream to

2429
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:23,360
multicast it was written by um

2430
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,239
uh

2431
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:27,280
uh one of our interns named giannis

2432
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,119
it and it all does just rewrites the

2433
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:30,800
source and destination address it picks

2434
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:33,679
a random ssm address

2435
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:36,239
out of 232

2436
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:38,080
and it also

2437
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,239
posts and creates a new entry on the

2438
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:42,000
multicast menu

2439
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,080
um giannis developed this uh in

2440
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:47,679
conjunction with um larry and maki um

2441
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:49,840
kind of working together on a project

2442
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,920
and it's this um this translator is

2443
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:54,159
deployed at george washington university

2444
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:57,199
um thanks to andrew gallo

2445
01:38:57,199 --> 01:38:59,040
in terms of you know what are the goals

2446
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:01,520
here we're just kind of

2447
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:04,159
um working our way through functionality

2448
01:39:04,159 --> 01:39:07,440
what would be awesome is if we could

2449
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:10,800
stream from an iphone or android camera

2450
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:13,199
uh to stream video to the unica to the

2451
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:14,400
translator

2452
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:17,040
right now we're just using uh vlc from

2453
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:20,000
uh from a desktop um

2454
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,920
but uh

2455
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:23,280
getting that working would be really

2456
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:25,679
interesting the translator which just

2457
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:26,960
translates the

2458
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:29,360
source and destination um that's already

2459
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:32,000
done um you know next would be you know

2460
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,520
if it could index the stream say for

2461
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,520
search um right now there's not a lot of

2462
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,280
streams there's currently zero and i'm

2463
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:38,480
going to create one

2464
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,639
um but you know if this takes off there

2465
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:42,400
could be zillions and you know creating

2466
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:44,639
a directory service so that you could

2467
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:46,960
subscribe to different types of streams

2468
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:47,920
say

2469
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:51,920
you know nature cam slash zoo cam slash

2470
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,199
panda cam

2471
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:55,440
um and then people could join

2472
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,679
that particular channel and be alerted

2473
01:39:57,679 --> 01:39:59,280
every time there's a new panda cam that

2474
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:01,760
pops up um so that's kind of the the

2475
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:04,159
long term vision um also potentially you

2476
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:06,480
know recording for for look back

2477
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:09,040
purposes since obviously multicast is a

2478
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:11,920
simultaneous you know live

2479
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:15,199
by nature um

2480
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,119
technology

2481
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:18,880
and then receiver apps right now we're

2482
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:23,360
using vlc um but would be nice um

2483
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:24,880
would be nice if we could use you know

2484
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,800
something a little easier something um

2485
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:27,760
an app

2486
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:30,960
uh on for ios and android um as well as

2487
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,560
something that you know

2488
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,239
if we could get this in the browser this

2489
01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:36,239
would be really really wonderful um but

2490
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:38,000
for now we're using vlc and you know

2491
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,159
we'd love some other ideas just to make

2492
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:41,760
this easier i think you know frederick

2493
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:42,800
said it well

2494
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,480
if if we could could make these things

2495
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,560
easier so that any user um on the

2496
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:48,480
internet could do it that'd be great um

2497
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:51,600
here's some references um to see the

2498
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,480
code this is an open source project um

2499
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,239
and if anybody's interested and get

2500
01:40:56,239 --> 01:40:58,239
involved um just shoot me an email we'd

2501
01:40:58,239 --> 01:41:00,000
love to you know we have a slack group

2502
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,360
of um co-conspirators or uh i think jake

2503
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,520
has called it a a cabal uh if you want

2504
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,360
to join arca ball please um just shoot

2505
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:08,880
me an email we'll add you to the slack

2506
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,080
group

2507
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:13,119
um and with that let me um

2508
01:41:13,119 --> 01:41:15,520
let me kind of show give a

2509
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:18,520
um

2510
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:19,920
uh

2511
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,440
show a demo

2512
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:23,600
um so first can you see my

2513
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,520
um

2514
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:29,040
can you guys see my command line here

2515
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,960
yeah that looks good a little bit small

2516
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:33,840
if you could do a plus plus maybe but uh

2517
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,040
we can see it

2518
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:37,360
yeah

2519
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:40,560
sorry especially those in the morning

2520
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,990
just you have to squint really

2521
01:41:42,990 --> 01:41:45,520
[Music]

2522
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:49,119
make hard text bigger

2523
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,639
okay all right so here's the one command

2524
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:55,920
line uh it's just um runs vlc uh

2525
01:41:55,920 --> 01:42:00,400
launches a um a video an mpeg4 and it's

2526
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,639
sending it to this magical ip address

2527
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:04,320
here which is the address of the

2528
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,960
translator and which is looking on this

2529
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:08,239
certain port

2530
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:12,879
so this is just a standard uh vlc

2531
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:16,719
vlc command for sourcing um

2532
01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:18,239

2543
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,719
it will launch one of the

2544
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:47,360
video streams on the mbone um

this

2547
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:52,719
which will

2548
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:54,719
create that next one

2549
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:58,159
uh that new stream um when if i reload

2550
01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:00,560
the multicast menu you'll see

2551
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:03,199
we just created a new stream

2552
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:04,560
uh if

2553
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:06,800
someone is able

2554
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:09,280
uh would be great if you could join this

2555
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:10,560
stream

2556
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:11,920
um

2557
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:12,880
and

2558
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:16,320
i'm gonna join

2559
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:19,040
does anybody i saw jake he does um one

2560
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,320
so one of the things you can click on

2561
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,719
this and just to see how it works

2562
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:25,440
we can rename this to uh

2563
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:28,000
cute puppy

2564
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,239
cam

2565
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:33,360
all right and we will upvote it a few

2566
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,280
times because this is the internet and

2567
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:36,840
it's all about shelf

2568
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:39,920
self-promotion um

2569
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:42,800
and is anybody out there

2570
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,920
able to join this stream

2571
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:53,840
just shout out if you are

2572
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:57,119
i'm getting something it's not quite

2573
01:43:57,119 --> 01:44:02,000
playing yet the plc is thinking about it

2574
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:07,360
um so here's the amt relay um you can

2575
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:09,280
actually see the relay we can see some

2576
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:10,800
multicast

2577
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:14,400
so the so the group address is 232 66 90

2578
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:15,600
70.

2579
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,760
that is this

2580
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,360
so you can see the

2581
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,040
incoming interface

2582
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:22,560
and here's the downstream interface this

2583
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,080
is there are two

2584
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:26,159
uh this means there's two tunnels so we

2585
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:28,320
can do a show amt

2586
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,320
tunnel

2587
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:32,000
detail

2588
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,719
and you can see these tunnels um this

2589
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:36,639
one is one amt

2590
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:37,760
gateway

2591
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,920
uh this happens to be a second laptop

2592
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:44,960
that's next to me um and here is another

2593
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:46,480
and here's a third so it looks like we

2594
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:48,960
have uh three receivers

2595
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:50,560
jake i'm guessing one of you are one of

2596
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:52,239
these two addresses

2597
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:54,239
um

2598
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:56,320
anyway uh

2599
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,639
are you seeing any video

2600
01:44:58,639 --> 01:44:59,520
yet

2601
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:00,960
uh

2602
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:03,440
no it looks like it's crashed my dlc but

2603
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,920
i'll try it again one sec

2604
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,679
i assure you it's working it's working

2605
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:09,679

2606
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:11,600

um

2610
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:17,600
i tried to

2611
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:20,800
i tried the url on the

2612
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,920
vlc from yesterday and

2613
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:26,480
i have a

2614
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:29,440
message saying that of course i i'm

2615
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:31,520
unable to open the

2616
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:34,159
the mrl so i'm not sure if you can see

2617
01:45:34,159 --> 01:45:36,239
me coming but uh

2618
01:45:36,239 --> 01:45:39,280
at least i i can't show the stream

2619
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:41,199
i can't see the stream sorry what's the

2620
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:45,239
v4 address of the relay

2621
01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:50,560
um

2622
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:52,560
so

2623
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:54,960
the relay is amt

2624
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:56,840
dash

2625
01:45:56,840 --> 01:46:01,119
relay dot m2 icast

2626
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:02,990
dot net

2627
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:04,800
[Music]

2628
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:07,199
let me see here

2629
01:46:07,199 --> 01:46:07,590
um

2630
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:09,360
[Music]

2631
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:10,880
and

2632
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:13,199
if you're using vlc for a recently

2633
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:15,760
downloaded version of vlc4 it has

2634
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:16,639
um

2635
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:20,000
by default this is the relay that is uh

2636
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,280
that is the it's just the default relay

2637
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:24,400
um

2638
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:27,840
but i did i did get some video uh after

2639
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,920
restarting but it's a

2640
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:33,040
a bit choppy and it's it's hanging again

2641
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:35,280
it looks like it's dropping some frames

2642
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,000
or

2643
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,360
uh

2644
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:38,719
yeah or something

2645
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:41,199
but uh

2646
01:46:41,199 --> 01:46:42,800
well for what it's worth

2647
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:45,040
what resolution are you sending what bit

2648
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:46,159
rate

2649
01:46:46,159 --> 01:46:47,760
i think it's

2650
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:49,119
it's not that big it's only like eight

2651
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:51,920
megs um

2652
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:54,639
but uh i am oh actually here let's sit

2653
01:46:54,639 --> 01:46:55,600
here

2654
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,880
uh show multicast

2655
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:01,440
route detail

2656
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:02,480
um

2657
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:04,480
this is

2658
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:08,599
yeah about eight megs

2659
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:12,400
eight megabytes per second

2660
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:15,679
well that's my problem then

2661
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,400
yeah you're still on dial up

2662
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:21,360
all right oh no it's a soup cannon wire

2663
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:23,040
gotcha

2664
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:26,080
um anyway uh

2665
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:27,600
um

2666
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,440
as as uh

2667
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,600
anybody interested in working on this uh

2668
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,760
as you can see this is you know this is

2669
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,440
the idea um

2670
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:38,800
the multicast menu by the way uh

2671
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:41,679
lauren who developed it is working on

2672
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:43,920
enhancing it to uh she is close to

2673
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:45,760
releasing a 2.0

2674
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:49,920
for the multicast menu um and uh all

2675
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:51,920
right so frederick you you're seeing

2676
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:56,000
something is it is it cute

2677
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:01,199
okay cool um

2678
01:48:01,199 --> 01:48:04,239
if you want i can just share my screen a

2679
01:48:04,239 --> 01:48:06,000
little bit so you can see what's what

2680
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,920
i'm seeing but uh

2681
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:09,440
what is that

2682
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:13,519
well that makes you realize in frederick

2683
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:17,920
yes share my screen and i think it's

2684
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:20,400
this one

2685
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:23,199
can you see it

2686
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:26,080
yes there you go

2687

it's great

2688
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:29,360
that is the video it was a little bit

2689
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:31,119
choppy at some point but you you see

2690
01:48:31,119 --> 01:48:33,760
that this is in sync with the message on

2691
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:34,960
the left

2692
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:35,760
yeah

2693
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:38,239
but it's yes

2694
01:48:38,239 --> 01:48:41,199
we've come to discover vlc as a vlc4

2695
01:48:41,199 --> 01:48:43,760
it's you know a beta version and it is a

2696
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:45,600
little fragile

2697
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:46,560
but

2698
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,400
anyway it does work

2699
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:49,840
excellent

2700
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:51,840
thanks

2701
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,840
all right with that um

2702
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:56,560
uh we do have one last presentation so

2703
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,159
um

2704
01:48:58,159 --> 01:49:00,480
the song uh if you want to get things

2705
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:03,199
teed up um if you'd like to share your

2706
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:05,760
preloaded slides um but with that uh as

2707
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:08,880
he does that anybody have any questions

2708
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:11,520
about this project and you know the idea

2709
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:13,679
and the vision for this is anybody can

2710
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:15,520
start streaming and sourcing something

2711
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:18,639
that anybody can start receiving and

2712
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:21,920
it should lower the bar for uh

2713
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:23,040
generating

2714
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:24,719
multi-gas sources

2715
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:27,960
that's great

2716
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:30,480
and this is an open source simple python

2717
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:32,639
script so if anybody wants to uh launch

2718
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:34,719
a translator themselves please let us

2719
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:36,719
know we'd love to we'd love to add you

2720
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:39,920
to the global translator pool which

2721
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:42,719
currently consists of one

2722
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:44,000
but

2723
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,599
we'd like to do more it's proof of

2724
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:47,599
concept um but you know you can see the

2725
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:49,520
vision here

2726
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:51,440
any other questions about uh off net

2727
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:54,840
sourcing and the multicast translator

2728
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,800
jake

2729
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:00,000
uh yeah lenny if i if i stood up uh one

2730
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,360
of your translators

2731
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:04,080
with uh

2732
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:06,400
with a

2733
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:09,840
uh with a dns based uh relay instead of

2734
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,360
a fixed relay

2735
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:12,560
um

2736
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:14,880
would you

2737
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:16,800
uh would you be

2738
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:20,239
so we we've talked about in i2 running

2739
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:22,000
uh that's that's like next on the agenda

2740
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,360
right is gonna be running the um

2741
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,159
uh

2742
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:27,920
the ingest

2743
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:30,480
using dryad

2744
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:33,280
to find the relays from external

2745
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:35,199
and pull it in um

2746
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:39,400
i'm just wondering if that's a

2747
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:44,000
that's that's potentially interesting

2748
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:44,719
so

2749
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:47,199
uh the injection so the translator just

2750
01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:49,119
uh gets the source onto a multicast

2751
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:50,000
network

2752
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,360
um with dryad you could

2753
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:56,159
use that

2754
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:58,320
to hide from i'll have to think about

2755
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,880
that i'm saying uh i'm saying i would

2756
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:04,239
perhaps run your open source translator

2757
01:51:04,239 --> 01:51:06,000
uh

2758
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:10,000
externally just in in my usual uh aws

2759
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,320
uh multicast

2760
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:14,320
oh yes yes yes

2761
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:15,679
instances

2762
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:17,119
yeah yeah definitely that would work and

2763
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:19,520
that could be pulled in

2764
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:22,159
uh wherever it could go directly from

2765
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:25,679
from those relays to uh

2766
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:27,760
you know your network or other networks

2767
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:30,639
as well um but also could could go uh

2768
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:32,800
natively to uh

2769
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:35,040
to various i2 receivers so

2770
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:37,280
um that that does look interesting and a

2771
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:39,040
useful source of traffic the streams i'm

2772
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:41,360
running are um

2773
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:43,360
i mean we've we've run some some

2774
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,960
customer streams but they usually want

2775
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:47,360
those a little more controlled um

2776
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:48,400
so if this

2777
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:50,239
if this uh

2778
01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:52,000
works okay it might be interesting to

2779
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,360
run i'll i'll

2780
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:56,000
see if i can fit it in and take it yeah

2781
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,520
i might have to wait till after some

2782
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:00,159
other stuff first

2783
01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:02,000
yes but if you if you would like

2784
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,320
somebody to to run it on an instance

2785
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:06,880
like that then let me know and i can see

2786
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:09,199
if i can help them

2787
01:52:09,199 --> 01:52:10,480
yeah i definitely think that could work

2788
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:12,800
and that could be a good test of um of

2789
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:15,119
dryad and for what it's worth uh the

2790
01:52:15,119 --> 01:52:17,360
next multicast menu will have the

2791
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:20,880
ability to uh specify a different relay

2792
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:23,040
um so right now it just uses the default

2793
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,719
relay in vlc but

2794
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:27,360
which like for example if you could plug

2795
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:29,360
in a different relay then it could

2796
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:30,960
launch that from a different relay so

2797
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:33,040
that would work in conjunction with what

2798
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:35,920
you know saba and you know his his

2799
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:38,960
uh his test stream so um so yeah that

2800
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,239
could uh

2801
01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:41,679
all these pieces can all work nicely

2802
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:44,159
together but with that it's uh i have to

2803
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:46,320
cut myself off and hand things over to

2804
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:48,880
you song um

2805
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,080
frederick yes

2806
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:52,400
very quickly just as a side note and

2807
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:54,639
very quickly we will try to to play with

2808
01:52:54,639 --> 01:52:58,480
uh this uh at least and see how we can

2809
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:01,199
use it in in the p4 lab

2810
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:02,000
great

2811
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,400
awesome

2812
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:07,759
all right you song you are up

2813
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:13,920
uh just share your preloaded slides um

2814
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:16,400
where the join cue button is

2815
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:17,520
there we go

2816
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:20,719
or share your screen

2817
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:24,599
and

2818
01:53:39,679 --> 01:53:41,599
we hear you

2819
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:42,880
okay thank you

2820
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:43,840
uh

2821
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:45,360
today i will

2822
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:49,280
present the multicultural redundant

2823
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:52,400
ingress router failover and

2824
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:55,920
this is the second presentation in itf

2825
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:59,440
uh so firstly i will

2826
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:01,840
give the quick very quickly review of

2827
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:05,239
this chart

2828
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:11,280
uh for this uh

2829
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:14,400
brief introduction another two ir and

2830
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:18,159
the in-grass routers are used to avoid a

2831
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:21,440
single node failure for the multicast

2832
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:24,000
the two irs are the

2833
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,840
umh the

2834
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:28,800
upstream multicast hub candidates for

2835
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:32,639
the ers the er means the egress router

2836
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:34,400
so for

2837
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:39,599
the pim or beer or rcpt p2mp or mmdp

2838
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:40,719
whatever

2839
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:41,840
the

2840
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:45,840
specific multicast technologies

2841
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:47,679
different functions

2842
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:49,679
can be used

2843
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:52,639
for for the

2844
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:55,760
deployment uh so

2845
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:57,920
there are three uh stand

2846
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,400
by modes can be deployed for the ir

2847
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:04,320
switchover in case of the irs failure

2848
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,679
that the

2849
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:08,400
code standby and the wall standby and

2850
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:09,920
the

2851
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:13,360
heart standby and the details uh you can

2852
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:16,480
find in the draft

2853
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:20,000
and the cost and the influence of the

2854
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,800
three uh modes are different and uh

2855
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,239
now uh

2856
01:55:26,239 --> 01:55:29,119
no one of these uh three modes are the

2857
01:55:29,119 --> 01:55:33,199
best choice as depends on the uh

2858
01:55:33,199 --> 01:55:34,719
actual network

2859
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:38,000
deployment so the network administrator

2860
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,679
should select the appropriate network

2861
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:40,960
mode

2862
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:43,599
so that's the brief introduction

2863
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:47,320
of the draft

2864
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:52,480
and this slide shows a minor update of

2865
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:53,840
the room

2866
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:56,159
one

2867
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:59,040
so the update is that

2868
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:01,840
in some deployments of the warm standby

2869
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:05,119
mode and the irs the irs

2870
01:56:05,119 --> 01:56:06,400
made

2871
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:08,880
in charge of different multicast flows

2872
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:13,360
for example uh if we have a 10 um

2873
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:16,239
multicast video flow so we can divide

2874
01:56:16,239 --> 01:56:18,320
for the five five for

2875
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:20,159
each of the irs

2876
01:56:20,159 --> 01:56:21,520
uh

2877
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:23,840
order is made charge of the different

2878
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:26,800
ers for one specific flow

2879
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:30,400
for example robust for one flow uh ir1

2880
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:32,080
in charge of uh

2881
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:38,480
er2 and er1 under the ir2 charge of er3

2882
01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:43,199
the ios can can be backup devices uh

2883
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:46,159
for the for each other and in case uh

2884
01:56:46,159 --> 01:56:47,679
one ir fails

2885
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:48,960
and

2886
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:51,199
the other ir may

2887
01:56:51,199 --> 01:56:52,639
notify

2888
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:53,920
uh

2889
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:55,199
do not

2890
01:56:55,199 --> 01:56:57,280
the arc may notify the other ir to

2891
01:56:57,280 --> 01:57:00,880
forward the flow to the ers for example

2892
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:03,199
for one specific flow

2893
01:57:03,199 --> 01:57:04,320
uh

2894
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:08,960
i1 is in charge of er1 er2 and the r2 is

2895
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:12,320
in charge of er3 and the if while l1

2896
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:13,280
fails

2897
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:15,679
r1 fails and

2898
01:57:15,679 --> 01:57:21,040
it will notify uh the r2 and r2 will uh

2899
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:23,040
forward the multicast flow

2900
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:26,800
uh to the er two yes er one year two and

2901
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:28,080
yeah three

2902
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:30,320
so that's the uh

2903
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:33,759
update of this version

2904
01:57:37,679 --> 01:57:39,840
uh that's of the uh

2905
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:42,480
uh draft and any comments are kind of

2906
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:44,960
webcam for this draft and

2907
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:48,639
uh we quarters uh uh think it's ready to

2908
01:57:48,639 --> 01:57:52,080
requesting the working group adoption

2909
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:54,880
that's all thank you

2910
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:04,960
jake you're up

2911
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:06,960
yeah thanks so

2912
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:08,159
um

2913
01:58:08,159 --> 01:58:09,119
in the

2914
01:58:09,119 --> 01:58:12,239
draft i i didn't see how it detects

2915
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:16,159
failure and uh and how it

2916
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:17,760
uh

2917
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:18,960
how it's

2918
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:20,960
doing the signaling from from one to the

2919
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:24,400
other that it needs to uh

2920
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:26,880
that it needs to be in charge of the

2921
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:29,520
of the ingest

2922
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:34,280
there's a

2923
01:58:37,119 --> 01:58:39,040
sorry go ahead yeah

2924
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:40,639
so uh

2925
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:43,199
for this chapter we we we just give the

2926
01:58:43,199 --> 01:58:46,000
uh a general way for the

2927
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,440
uh

2928
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:50,400
multicast root root router

2929
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:52,960
failure

2930
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:54,400
not not

2931
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:57,760
involved the specific technology

2932
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:00,920
in that

2933
01:59:02,159 --> 01:59:04,480
uh

2934
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:07,119
okay so

2935
01:59:07,119 --> 01:59:08,880
um i guess

2936
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:11,840
i i i think that this is a really

2937
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:14,000
valuable uh

2938
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,679
space to develop

2939
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:18,880
but i'd like to um

2940
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:20,080
i'd like to see

2941
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:22,400
um

2942
01:59:23,119 --> 01:59:24,080
uh

2943
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:26,080
i i guess

2944
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:26,960
what

2945
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:29,199
some more specific i'd like to see some

2946
01:59:29,199 --> 01:59:31,679
some recommended mechanisms at least

2947
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:35,040
like if some exist then i'd like to see

2948
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:38,400
references to them uh or

2949
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:40,080
um

2950
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:41,119
uh

2951
01:59:41,119 --> 01:59:42,320
you know

2952
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:44,560
some some guidance on how to do the

2953
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:45,920
detection that

2954
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,679
that a failover

2955
01:59:47,679 --> 01:59:48,639
uh

2956
01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:51,440
is right because it seems like

2957
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:53,520
that's a

2958
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:54,960
uh

2959
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:57,599
i i thought that was necessary in the

2960
01:59:57,599 --> 02:00:00,719
for this draft to be um

2961
02:00:00,719 --> 02:00:03,199
uh to be

2962
02:00:03,199 --> 02:00:04,320
uh

2963
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:07,280
headed the right direction uh to me but

2964
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:09,040
um

2965
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:11,520
yeah but thanks i think this is a this

2966
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:14,159
is a good space to to to work in and i'm

2967
02:00:14,159 --> 02:00:16,320
glad somebody is writing it writing it

2968
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:18,080
up thank you

2969
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:21,199
thank you thank you for coming

2970
02:00:24,719 --> 02:00:25,520
um

2971
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:28,480
sandy was there something you

2972
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:31,040
had to add

2973
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:40,719
about

2974
02:00:40,719 --> 02:00:43,440
sorry memory

2975
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:45,678
yes

2976
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:47,840
okay i would like to say

2977
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:49,360
i think

2978
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:51,599
text suggestion is very useful we can

2979
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:54,639
add some description about the detection

2980
02:00:54,639 --> 02:00:56,719
and the other functions

2981
02:00:56,719 --> 02:00:59,360
and the other details in the draft in

2982
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:01,199
the future version

2983
02:01:01,199 --> 02:01:03,519
thank you

2984
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:06,800
so um

2985
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:08,960
for those who noticed uh

2986
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:11,920
there was a we had two polls uh who was

2987
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:14,400
read the draft and who would like to see

2988
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:16,480
it adopted as a working group draft um

2989
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:19,280
we had seven people who have read it

2990
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:21,119
so it's a good sign so a third of the

2991
02:01:21,119 --> 02:01:22,560
number of people on

2992
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:26,159
um and uh looks like um if you could

2993
02:01:26,159 --> 02:01:27,599
just

2994
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:29,040
uh

2995
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:31,920
put your hand up uh show of hands uh

2996
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:34,560
who's who thinks that this this is be a

2997
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:37,119
a draft that would who would like to

2998
02:01:37,119 --> 02:01:38,239
adopt this

2999
02:01:38,239 --> 02:01:39,920
from the work um as a working group

3000
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:41,280
document

3001
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:44,800
um so far we've got six anybody else

3002
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:46,400
no objections

3003
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,320
so i think we'll take this to the list

3004
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:51,280
for an official um

3005
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:53,199
working group adoption call this was by

3006
02:01:53,199 --> 02:01:55,520
the way presented back in 09

3007
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:57,760
um and uh

3008
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:00,159
figured we'd represent it again to get

3009
02:02:00,159 --> 02:02:02,480
it fresh on people's minds first

3010
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:04,560
before the adoption call so

3011
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:08,480
um looks like there's support um

3012
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:10,719
to uh to adopt so we'll take this

3013
02:02:10,719 --> 02:02:12,320
officially to the list

3014
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:14,719
uh for an official adoption call um

3015
02:02:14,719 --> 02:02:18,000
please speak up on the list um both if

3016
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,760
you want to see it adopted or not

3017
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:22,960
adopted and

3018
02:02:23,599 --> 02:02:26,159
also you know any any suggestions that

3019
02:02:26,159 --> 02:02:28,159
you see for the document are of course

3020
02:02:28,159 --> 02:02:31,199
always welcome at all times

3021
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:32,960
and it looks like i'm about to end that

3022
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:36,800
poll uh there we have seven who say yay

3023
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:39,920
and one person who did not raise a hand

3024
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:42,400
um so

3025
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:46,280
let the record show that

3026
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:47,679
and

3027
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:51,040
any other questions or comments

3028
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:51,840
for

3029
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:54,000
um

3030
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,320
for this draft

3031
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:03,760
any other questions or comments for

3032
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:05,280
anything in general before we close down

3033
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:07,759
the session

3034
02:03:11,599 --> 02:03:13,440
okay with that thanks for thanks for
