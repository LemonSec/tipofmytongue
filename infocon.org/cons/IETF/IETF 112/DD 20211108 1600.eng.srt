10
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,559
and while we're waiting for tail to join

11
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,760

uh it's somebody

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,000
willing to um

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,480
act as our uh scribe

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,320
we don't need like line for line this is

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,879
being recorded so we don't need like um

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,960
the narrative and the whole

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,199
dialogue captured what we really need is

19
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,239
any decisions that get made uh or you

20
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:56,960
know

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,359
sort of resolutions we come to captured

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,600
please um

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,119
uh so hopefully it's easier subscribe

24
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,320
well

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,080
really describe uh

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,320
the subscribe for the the

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,320
the hedgehog dock the hedge dock

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,119
so i guess no takers ride you change

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,479
whatever you want to call but really we

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,280
need resolutions

31
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,320
captured and not the whole

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,600
back and forth we're not looking for a

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,240
court reporter

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,200

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,520

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,320

okay so let's get started uh we have a

48
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
fairly good agenda and and tail will

49
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,400
join when you can

50
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,000
um so we have subscribe selection uh and

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,360
um i think we're good to go then

52
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,480
so i've uploaded the uh the one of the

53
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,360
big changes with this version of uh meet

54
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,519
echo is that we now have the slides

55
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,680
directly being pulled in so i've

56
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,840
pre-loaded the slides so when it's

57
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,920
a presenter's turn to speak uh you can

58
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,080
actually drive the slides directly out

59
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,760
of

60
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,440
the session yourself without having to

61
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,599
rely upon one of the chairs

62
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,680
to push the buttons for you so hopefully

63
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,599
this will work nicely i've preloaded

64
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,599
them all so hopefully

65
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,399
we're all good to go

66
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,560
so uh

67
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,680
we're gonna spend a couple of minutes

68
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,440
focusing on note well uh we've been

69
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,760
asked by the the isg

70
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,560
uh to spend a little bit more time than

71
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,319
we normally do on that well obviously

72
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,360
this meeting is an itf uh you know uh

73
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,720
activity and it is covered by notewell

74
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,959
but in particular

75
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,040
there is a uh

76
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,440
a request we've every working group has

77
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,799
had to apply a little additional focus

78
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,920
around uh making people aware of the

79
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,239
contact and the behavior not that we're

80
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,400
it's calling out and saying anybody in

81
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,519
add has been uh causing a problem we've

82
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,959
been getting along very very well in my

83
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,360
opinion so this is more of a reminder to

84
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,879
all of us uh in in not in any form a

85
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,799
slap on anybody's wrist

86
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,519
uh but please be aware that you know

87
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,519
we are all working here together be kind

88
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,400
to one another uh the itip does have

89
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,480
anti-harassment policies in place we

90
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,840
have an ombudsman uh to work with

91
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,760
and uh you know

92
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,720
if you

93
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,400
just take an extra second if you're if

94
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,640
you're heated and passionate in the

95
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,399
discussion you know take the extra

96
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,079
second to have an extra breath before

97
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,199
you maybe respond harshly or unkindly to

98
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,680
somebody's point that they've made

99
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,160
and we'll all get along very well and

100
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,080
historically add has gone along very

101
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,759
very well uh it's been one of my

102
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,160
pleasures to co-chair this group uh

103
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,560
because in fact we are so well behaved

104
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,199
uh i'm glenn dean obviously i'm one of

105
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,000
the co-chairs of edd and uh tail a.k.a

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,479
david lawrence is uh my co-chair

107
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
mr eric

108
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,639
and i i i don't think i'm saying eric's

109
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,320
last name perfectly properly because i

110
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,479
don't have the proper accent but he's

111
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,280
our uh our lovely area director uh and

112
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,520
he gives our good oversight and an

113
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,919
overview and management of the edd

114
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,400
working group

115
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,000
so here's our agenda for today uh we uh

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
are going through that we've done the

117
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,240
note well they've done the uh admin

118
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,199
portion

119
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,720
uh this is the part where we have the

120
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,160
agenda bash uh

121
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,680
if people looked at the agenda last

122
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,160
night there was one change uh overnight

123
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,639
uh in that we had an additional topic

124
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,440
here uh which was the svcd

125
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,240
um

126
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,800
draft uh there just wasn't a lot of new

127
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
material for there so uh we don't have

128
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,639
any slides being presented on that so we

129
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,479
pulled off the agenda so that gives back

130
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,840
actually a few more minutes for uh

131
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,360

all right sounds good hopefully we can

171
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,000
converge on this

172
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,680
all right so i'm tommy pauly presenting

173
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,160
on behalf of our other authors for the

174
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,880
discovery of designated resolvers

175
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,720
this is one of our adopted working group

176
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,120
drafts

177
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,520
so first just to update people on the

178
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,720
status

179
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,280
we did have a draft 03 that was

180
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,840
published in

181
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,280
october um

182
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,879
the main updates there were to align

183
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,000
with the newly adopted

184
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,919
dns svcb

185
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,199
draft that ben put out

186
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,120
and then it also um

187
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
added some text to explain

188
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,639
that

189
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,599
we have these documented methods of

190
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,160
validating or verifying resolvers

191
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,319
using certificates or just using the

192
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,520
fact that

193
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,840
an address is shared

194
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,520
but clients may use other methods

195
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,199
that could be more strict more relaxed

196
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,400
in the future

197
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,599
this

198
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,400
opens up the possibility for things like

199
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,199
ben's other draft about

200
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,960
how to handle um

201
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,680
forwarders

202
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,360
so it's not required that

203
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,519
implementations support that

204
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,479
but

205
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,760
they can and this this kind of gives

206
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,679
implementations of the freedom going

207
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,679
forward to choose different methods and

208
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,640
that these are just kind of the two base

209
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,720
methods

210
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,640
another change i'd like to point out

211
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,240
that was an editorial one that we made

212
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,560
just recently was

213
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,519
to change the name of one of these modes

214
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,600
from the authenticated mode to the

215
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,440
verified mode

216
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,200
uh martin thompson

217
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,399
pointed out and it was correct that when

218
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,880
we are checking to see that an ip

219
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,560
address is covered

220
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,080
by

221
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,560
the certificate of the do or dot server

222
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,240
that we're connecting to

223
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,920
it's not really a true authentication

224
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,160
because we just you know we had this ip

225
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,600
address

226
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,519
um that was just you know someone typed

227
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,360
it into their machine or we got it over

228
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,839
dhcp um that really what we're doing is

229
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,200
we're just verifying that the things

230
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,320
match up

231
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,160
so rather than wading into the notion of

232
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,920
what is authenticated or not we're just

233
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,760
going to say it's verified

234
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,360
other than that that part of the

235
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,760
protocol does not change at all

236
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,000
so that leaves us with one currently

237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,519
open issue

238
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,600
with one pull request

239
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,279
that i have made to

240
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,000
satisfy that so i want to go into detail

241
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,080
now on the contents of this pull request

242
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,279
and there are a couple different changes

243
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,720
in it and so i want to walk through

244
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,240
these different ones and as i go through

245
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,360
these

246
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,279
i want to make sure that we kind of all

247
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,399
understand it

248
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,839
and that if we have any clarifying

249
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,040
questions or concerns about each point

250
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,480
that we can sort those out now

251
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,480
all right

252
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,200
so the first

253
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,040
change in here which i think is kind of

254
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,880
like the main

255
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,360
core change

256
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,920
um is something we've discussed before i

257
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,880
think it's

258
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,000
ultimately not going to be really

259
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,800
controversial um it's just what is

260
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,839
actually being verified

261
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,399
um previously the text

262
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,560
for the case where you already knew a

263
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,480
name like i i knew i'm talking to

264
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,440
dns.google um i just have to check that

265
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,120
that thing that i already knew was

266
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,279
covered in the certificate that was

267
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,480
clear

268
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,560
in the case in which we

269
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,720
already knew only the address like i

270
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,920
only knew 8.8.8.8

271
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,240
um we said you have to check the address

272
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,040
and the name in the certificate

273
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,480
martin rightly pointed out that that

274
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,760
really isn't consistent there's no true

275
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,279
need for the verification to actually

276
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,959
check that other value and it adds a lot

277
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,120
of complexity

278
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,440
so the change here is to simply say

279
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,680
hey if you discovered

280
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,760
if what you started out with and what

281
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,000
you issued your ddr query for

282
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,079
was based on a known ip address

283
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,160
you should check and verify that that ip

284
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,200
address is covered in the certificate

285
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,040
if you discovered based on a known host

286
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,959
name you check that host name in the

287
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,720
certificate

288
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,480
and those two cases are just what they

289
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,760
are

290
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,720
um

291
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,120
no other checks that you do within the

292
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,200
certificate for verification for the

293
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,399
purposes of ddr

294
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,240
so are there any

295
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,480
questions or objections to this point

296
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,800
here

297
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,880
see in the chat partner says it's

298
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,959
sensible great

299
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,399
all right um i think

300
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,839
that

301
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,680
goes forward then

302
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,720
all right

303
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
next step

304
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,079
sorry sorry

305
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,120
we have a

306
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,959
person in the queue

307
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,120
i don't i don't see someone in queue

308
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,360
okay

309
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,160
did somebody want comment back on

310
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,719
no vinnie

311
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
hey vinny go ahead clarify when you say

312
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,639
ip

313
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,560
address it's

314
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,639
both the

315
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,680
uh

316
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,399
resolver ip and the

317
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,320
and that you own the ip that was

318
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,399
originally used to bootstrap the

319
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,839
discovery right it's it's both of those

320
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,079
yeah specifically this is

321
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,360
if

322
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,160
if the thing i had received over dhcp or

323
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,440
had manually configured was 8.8.8.8

324
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,120
and i issued

325
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,560
a udp port 53

326
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,880
query for the svcb record of

327
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,279
dns.resolve.opera

328
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,440
to quad 8

329
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,680
then when i actually connect to the doe

330
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,120
or dot server i look for quad 8 being in

331
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,279
that because the thing i started with

332
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,720
was quad aid right okay

333
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,000
um

334
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
becker

335
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,519
well so now i now i'm confused um so um

336
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,839
well so i thought i understood um so i

337
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,920
think we all agree that the thing you

338
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,519
started with bettering the certificate

339
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,760
um i think the question is

340
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,959
is

341
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,800
is does the thing that you got as a

342
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,320
result that you ddr had to be in a

343
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,560
certificate so i start with quad eight i

344
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,959
get hey look over here at you know i

345
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,240
don't know quad four um and then squad

346
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,480
four for me in the certificate as well

347
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,279
um

348
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,760
so right it used to say yes and now it

349
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,360
just says you just checked the thing you

350
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,720
started with yeah that that's right

351
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,760
that's what i thought you'd said and

352
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,199
then i got confused you're talking with

353
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,600
me so i'm sorry i'm sorry yeah um no i'm

354
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,240
i'm listening close enough that's i i so

355
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,240
while it is a little yucky to not have

356
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,560
the um i think i think i think the way

357
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,720
to think about this is this is a scene

358
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,199
effectively right um and so the rules

359
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,560
for c name or the thing you start with

360
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,680
the thing you look up not the thing you

361
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,360
end up with

362
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,760
awesome

363
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,720
all right

364
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,880
so this is the core thing i think

365
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,480
we all agree on this

366
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,440
and that is a big win

367
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,120
um there are a couple

368
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,040
other changes

369
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,240
the first one here i also think is very

370
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,880
uh non-controversial we need to clarify

371
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,079
that

372
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,360
um

373
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,000
you didn't start with resolver. you must

374
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,079
not use that within

375
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,639
the s and i or your doe request

376
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,360
authority um that is not a thing um so

377
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,440
just really laying that out

378
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,279
i think that's a good thing if for some

379
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,680
reason you disagree with that

380
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,440
please speak up

381
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,519
and then i um the

382
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,079
last thing which i think

383
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,000
needs most discussion here is

384
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,720
while the thing you check

385
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,040
is the address

386
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,320
or the name that you started with

387
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,680
there can be this intermediate

388
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,360
target name so in the case i gave before

389
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,399
we have quad 8 but there also is this

390
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,760
identity of the thing i'm connecting to

391
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,199
which may be a doe server that is

392
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,759
running on as dns.google

393
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,519
or something like that

394
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,199
and should i be allowed to as the client

395
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,800
use

396
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,480
something other than that original ip

397
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,519
address quad 8 as

398
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,320
the

399
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,639
authority as the name there's the host

400
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,160
i'm connecting to

401
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,399
in the doe uri

402
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,160
martins and queue i do i do have an

403
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,519
example that i

404
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,040
want to walk through here just to go

405
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,839
through um is that okay martin if i

406
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,800
quickly bounce through that

407
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,279
little yes go ahead sorry

408
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,839
no worries

409
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,560
um yeah so in general

410
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,759
like you know we could do it either way

411
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,560
but the place that i think it's ugly if

412
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,560
we say you must only ever use that

413
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,000
original address

414
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,920
is this so let's say i start out with

415
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,519
quad 8

416
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,600
i receive the following answer

417
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,480
for it i see oh this is dns.google it

418
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,920
has a doe server running h2

419
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,079
great i'm going to use that

420
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,880
along with that because this is svcp

421
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,759
i

422
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,519
will either have received ip address

423
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,320
hints but i'll have to

424
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,680
either have additional records that came

425
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,160
along with this for a and quality

426
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
or i'll issue specific queries for a in

427
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,839
quad a of

428
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,399
dns.google

429
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,519
and so that resolves me to quad 8 8.8

430
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,519
4.4 and i have some ipv6 addresses

431
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,519
our client stack prefers that we use

432
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,160
ipv6 addresses and so now

433
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,480
you know i'm connecting

434
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,959
to an ipv6 address

435
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,919
that i know is for dns.google that's the

436
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,919
thing i resolved i'm going to check quad

437
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,240
8 in the certificate

438
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,520
but you know is the client allowed

439
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,039
because it knows that it this is

440
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,679
dns.google to put that as the authority

441
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,480
or must it put quad 8 as the authority

442
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
even when it's talking to

443
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
an address that is not that

444
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,240
and just you know for our

445
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,919
for example like our implementation

446
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,400
stacks of http it's often

447
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,080
awkward and not even a publicly

448
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,360
accessible api to have a different host

449
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,960
than the thing that you're doing the

450
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,320
actual dns a and quad a queries for

451
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,440
and that's

452
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,120
the case we have

453
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,000
here and so martin please

454
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,480
chime in

455
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,679
we should be

456
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,240
looking for whatever names might appear

457
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,400
in the dns for these these things i

458
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,960
think we should start with what we have

459
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,080
and end up with the same thing so there

460
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,600
are a couple of places where you're

461
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,000
going to be using this information

462
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,760
if you're doing there's obviously two

463
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,440
places s i

464
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,000
and the host headerfield

465
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,799
and

466
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,600
the

467
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,000
sni field is a simple one don't put it

468
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,039
in because you uh you have

469
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,280
config been configured with or have

470
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
discovered an ip address and you don't

471
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,039
put ip addresses in that field for some

472
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,000
reason

473
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,960
um

474
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,440
the host header field i think the same

475
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,679
applies there you've got an ip address

476
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,799
and that's what you started with and

477
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,640
that's what you put there as well

478
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,880
all of the intermediate stuff that you

479
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,760
might have discovered along the way is

480
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,160
information but is

481
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,240
internal to the resolution process that

482
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,520
you have

483
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,559
and so

484
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,679
while

485
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,160
it might be nice that you have some nice

486
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,880
names along that path i don't think that

487
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,559
there's something we want to put into

488
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,080
the protocol

489
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,960
okay so two

490
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,880
two questions here so one you did

491
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,919
mention kind of like the thing that we

492
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,160
did dns for um when we talk about you

493
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,280
know doing dns the thing that i issue an

494
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,679
a in quad a record for query for is

495
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,080
dns.google it is not

496
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,240
quad 8.

497
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,880
correct but you started with an ip

498
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,640
address

499
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,440
and ultimately you'll never be

500
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,559
in a dns query right i i was asking for

501
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,360
i was asking for a result

502
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,320
right but you are i are you

503
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,160
not authenticating against that ip

504
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,720
address when you when you make these

505
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,799
queries

506
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,080
you're not i

507
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,280
i'm just verifying that that ip address

508
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,720
is covered in the certificate i'm not

509
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,200
authenticating against it

510
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,520
right but you're okay so that that's the

511
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,720
key question

512
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,320
which which is

513
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,559
when you feed this information into your

514
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,880
stack your stack is going to say

515
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,640
uh it's going to receive a string and

516
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,880
that string is going to contain an ip

517
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,960
address and it and

518
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,919
stacks don't want to have one

519
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,480
thing going into that and another and

520
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,799
another thing going into the host header

521
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,000
field or the sni field

522
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,600
you're going to think so it's very

523
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,559
common for us and like you know i i know

524
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,280
several you know public apis that allow

525
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,200
you to customize your certificate

526
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,840
validation and verification

527
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,760
but do not let you

528
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,120
separate out here is the name that gets

529
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,799
resolved into addresses from the host

530
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,679
and

531
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,360
so essentially all i'm saying is like it

532
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,000
should be allowed for the client

533
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,880
to use that dns.google name

534
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,480
instead of quad 8

535
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,120
but it could use either

536
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,400
yeah i think that just complicates

537
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,679
things unnecessarily and that

538
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,600
customization is not possible in a whole

539
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,039
lot of stacks

540
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,400
you might have that flexibility but

541
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,360
that's not that's not a common case

542
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,039
okay

543
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,760
all right let's hear from other people

544
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,080
thank you

545
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,000
um but i i think i basically agree with

546
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,919
martin but i actually have a more less

547
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,120
less philosophical and possible

548
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,039
practical concern um

549
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,400
imagine the illustration in which you

550
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,559
have name-based virtual hosting

551
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,440
um

552
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,320
and

553
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,280
um

554
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,039
uh and in which um in which you get one

555
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,760
thing if you stuff in 8888 as a host

556
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,280
header you get another thing you stuff

557
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,960
in you know

558
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,200
safe maybe safelookup.google.com

559
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,000
right

560
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,480
and so and so what and so the

561
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,320
consequence of this design would be to

562
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,039
permit the on path attacker in in the

563
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,799
network to force you into a different

564
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,919
resolution otherwise would have gotten

565
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,600
which they would not have been possible

566
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,880
in the which was not even possible in um

567
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,320
in the setting where the thing that was

568
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,000
stuffed in to the host header was the

569
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,640
thing that was configured and uh

570
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,520
okay

571
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,840
um so i i i for a little bit and maybe

572
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,520
maybe you could persuade me that that

573
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,720
already is a problem but i don't think

574
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,039
it is and the reason is because um i i

575
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,320
think i think there's i mean maybe

576
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,760
there's no actual configuration this way

577
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,720
but it seems to me you could have a

578
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,400
configuration with this way um and um

579
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,840
and because the point is it's not really

580
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,280
a matter of auditing the certificate

581
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,280
it's a matter of what the client tells

582
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,600
the server what its expectations are and

583
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
um and and and the server may or might

584
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,520
use us an eye for this purpose and and

585
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,559
the host site is what's intended for

586
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,080
this purpose and so if you key only on

587
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,360
the host header it'll be legal in this

588
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,799
case then you would get different

589
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,240
responses and so i think i think that

590
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,919
this is a vulnerability which they

591
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,320
shouldn't do

592
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,240
so

593
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,559
i think this is something that

594
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,760
already exists because you also have

595
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,600
the the doe path which could also be a

596
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,440
way of splitting up like i could have a

597
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,320
different

598
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,159
path for different functionality i could

599
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,520
have you know

600
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,720
uh safe dns query and this dns query um

601
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,120
and we could also imagine extensions

602
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,400
to

603
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,640
the svcb format for resolvers that

604
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,000
includes

605
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,840
other parameters which say oh this is

606
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,520
the one that does

607
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,600
our you know malware filtering and

608
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,360
here's the one that doesn't like i mean

609
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,840
we can imagine that there could be a

610
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,760
valid validity around having different

611
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,280
options

612
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,799
and

613
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,720
you know to that and i think the only

614
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,720
thing we really are confirming

615
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,559
is that

616
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,760
quad 8 is covered in the certificate

617
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,840
all of the other aspects

618
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,440
if someone is attacking me to try to get

619
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,360
me to go to a different variant of that

620
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,039
server

621
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,240
they already could by changing the path

622
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,440
and that

623
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,799
that means that essentially it's a

624
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,720
feature of this that you could have

625
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,760
different things and now we're

626
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,280
essentially saying

627
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,120
if you have different services offered

628
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,279
by

629
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,480
something that

630
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,799
can be delegated by quad 8 they can only

631
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,440
use the path and they cannot use

632
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,880
the name

633
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,799
to offer those different services

634
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,919
um

635
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,279
and i think that's an unnecessary

636
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,559
restriction so

637
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,760
you know you could certainly have a

638
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,960
client that only says i'm going to use

639
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,640
the address i got

640
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,200
but saying that you know it is illegal

641
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,600
for the client to use that authority

642
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,840
even if it knows a meaning behind it and

643
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,600
knows that it's safe to do it i think

644
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,640
that's

645
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,080
going too far

646
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,279
well now you're persuading me to apply

647
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,440
this back um um

648
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,640
i i mean seriously um um i think you

649
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,640
know that basically um

650
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,960
that uh i think i think that like the

651
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,480
the underlying security property we're

652
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,520
going for here is that the um is it is

653
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,039
it the thing that was entered in that is

654
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,159
configured is determinative with

655
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,679
responses you get and that's all the

656
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,120
nonsense about like whatever once was

657
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,720
supposed to meet and and so um

658
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,760
so

659
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,000
like

660
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,600
if we're gonna have anything that's not

661
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,760
covered by that then the text needs to

662
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,200
say that then the text of the

663
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,640
specifications to forbid differential

664
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,840
behavior based on anything that can be

665
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,279
configured by the attacker

666
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,200
and so um

667
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,400
that would mean do a path and it would

668
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,919
it's that aminopathy would mean in this

669
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,520
case host if we were allowed that so i

670
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,120
think like i'm happy to file a separate

671
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,880
issue but i'm just saying like that it's

672
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,720
not it's not a reasonable you can find a

673
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,080
reasonable setting to have the situation

674
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,679
be that

675
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,360
you know that there's that there's a way

676
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,559
for the attacker to completely change

677
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,640
the response by material material that's

678
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,720
not authenticated

679
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,919
and that's what i mean i felt like i was

680
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,440
like a little very long time as well

681
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,120
that couldn't happen right and so like

682
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,360
and so and so you know um

683
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,440
um so so i think that like that that's

684
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,960
actually a problem but i i also think

685
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,360
that like the um that

686
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,240
that uh you know uh

687
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,080
the um the the dopamine situation is

688
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,200
actually is actually slightly less

689
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,919
serious in the sense that um that at

690
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,520
least is under the same authority

691
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,039
whereas in the situation i'm disgusting

692
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,960
things are included from authorities um

693
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
and you know so imagine imagine for

694
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,559
instance and that i guess so here's my

695
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,880
hypothetical cloudflare yeah on

696
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,480
cloudflares on this i mean i don't know

697
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,919
if they do but they're from the same ip

698
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,919
addresses they serve cloudfloor joe and

699
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,720
they serve like and and they serve like

700
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,360
echoers like lying doe resolver right

701
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,120
and in the situation usually in the s so

702
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,880
associate in the situation with gopath

703
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,799
it's not possible for the attack if

704
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,120
cloudflare if fire only has one dns path

705
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,559
right then there's not possible attacker

706
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,919
to forcing the wrong answers but in the

707
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,159
situation with with a lot of specified

708
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,400
the host then in fact then in fact i can

709
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,080
just i can just divert them entirely my

710
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,640
resolver and my fake was over and i can

711
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,240
say anything i want so it's actually

712
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,880
much much worse

713
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,400
as long as cloud fires certificates

714
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,760
search certificates for that for the ip

715
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,320
address and and for uh um uh you know

716
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,679
and it doesn't show them for the

717
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,720
nominations

718
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,120
they would have to allow that ip address

719
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,480
to show up on the certificate for this

720
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,520
afternoon

721
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,039
well yeah but right right

722
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,919
all it has to have is it has to allow

723
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,120
you to connect to

724
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,080
1.1.1.1 and feed in a host header that

725
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,840
was an ordinary host header and that

726
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,120
would be like

727
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,360
right so so you're saying after the tls

728
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,039
validation then it just redirects it off

729
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,720
to something else what is it it just it

730
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,240
just steers based on it just steers

731
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,159
based on just hosting that's not right

732
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,320
um which i mean bear in mind is is a

733
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,159
permitted behavior because it is

734
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,320
generally behavior um because of it

735
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,918
because of connection pooling so anyway

736
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,919
but i'm happy to write this up but i

737
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:14,960
think this is more fun

738
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,720
but i don't want to specify i have no

739
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,919
idea what cloudflare actually does but i

740
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,360
just shoot for example because i know

741
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,760
there's cdm that multi-host so like

742
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,720
people can tell me they don't do that

743
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,159
but that's not my concerns on the cloud

744
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,840
fire particularly

745
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,080
okay that makes sense um so i guess you

746
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,919
know if we go this route of saying you

747
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,600
have to have it

748
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,520
then i guess the question is are people

749
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,480
okay with

750
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,520
sending

751
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,159
the authority of quad 8 to an ip address

752
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,159
that's a v6 address and if we're fine

753
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,200
with that then we're fine with that

754
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,000
yeah i think so

755
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
okay

756
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,760
okay

757
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,559
i'm not clear on what the exploit is

758
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,799
there um

759
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,960
who's talking maybe i'm just not

760
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,399
like the cloud footage did you want to

761
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,760
hi ben schwartz

762
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,279
so uh

763
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,520
another way to interpret what what eric

764
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,120
was talking about is that allowing this

765
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,919
client behavior implicitly imposes a

766
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,240
bunch of hidden restrictions on the

767
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,080
server servers in order

768
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,840
if for this to be safe for the client to

769
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,880
do servers have to be

770
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,039
have to avoid a bunch of configurations

771
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,440
a bunch of configurations where it would

772
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,279
become insecure if the client is allowed

773
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,559
to do this and there are also

774
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,559
configurations that would stop working

775
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,600
so

776
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,840
one of those

777
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,559
is

778
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,880
one of the things that i thought was fun

779
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,320
here is

780
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,120
this

781
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,279
i think implicitly requires

782
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,320
that both the ip address and the target

783
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,880
name appear in the same certificate

784
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,360
first of all it requires that the that

785
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,720
the server have a certificate that

786
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,679
covers the target name

787
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,960
um

788
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,640
does it

789
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,840
well so we can step back and say are we

790
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,760
is the client actually going to verify

791
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,640
that this authority um is present in any

792
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,080
certificate that the host is

793
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,240
authoritative for for this authority i

794
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,760
think it's only verifying it's only

795
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,440
verifying the address

796
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,520
okay so in that case um then you're

797
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,880
doing something very exciting you have

798
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,840
an https connection

799
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,480
with a an authority that is completely

800
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,159
unverified

801
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,840
and while that might sort of be safe in

802
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,679
this particular case in general it's

803
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,440
extremely unsafe

804
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,799
and it would allow which is why

805
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,039
originally it said you checked both

806
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:43,919
right

807
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,080
um because it would allow things like

808
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,440
allowing

809
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,600
anybody in the world to rewrite your

810
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,399
gmail cookies

811
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,039
or extract them so

812
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,919
if uh you know maybe in in a you know

813
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,880
completely stateless isolated http

814
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,440
context somehow it's safe but um it

815
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,520
definitely i think would constitute a

816
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,000
violation of the http semantic rules

817
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,480
because https urls

818
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,440
um are only valid for authorities that

819
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,320
have proven cryptographic control

820
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,440
of the

821
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,200
that have cryptographic proof of control

822
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,840
of the authority

823
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,600
name i don't see

824
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,200
as standards matter i don't see a

825
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,880
problem with saying that the authority

826
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,480
is an ip address that is totally

827
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,399
different from the transport level ip

828
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,279
address

829
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,360
okay

830
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,440
i think we probably want to comment on

831
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,679
that to explicitly note like hey by the

832
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,760
way it's fine

833
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,520
to do that

834
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
by the way another interesting

835
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
problem that this generates is that it

836
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,360
requires it at least potentially

837
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,760
requires

838
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,039
um

839
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,640
requires the servers to use real

840
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,960
names in their target names

841
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,640
um yes

842
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,080
yes

843
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,840
yeah that would be a consequence of this

844
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,519
which if we wanted it i think we'd be

845
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,880
okay but yeah

846
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,000
okay

847
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
all right

848
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,320
eric

849
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,120
after checking to make sure it's

850
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,279
actually the correct eric um

851
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,480
the

852
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,559
yeah this is this whole area is one

853
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,919
where i still have a bunch a lot of

854
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,200
anxiety they don't necessarily quite

855
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,360
have the right answer here i think the

856
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,600
issues that the the attacks people just

857
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,519
raised added on to some of the ones like

858
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,960
i think

859
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,200
even the even the topic of what to do

860
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,039
with sni is critical here because a lot

861
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,120
of these things are sufficiently

862
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,679
multi-hosting environments that we need

863
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,559
to make sure that the client must send a

864
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,880
s i that

865
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,960
matches what it expects to come back but

866
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,080
s but there's the messy situation that

867
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,279
the

868
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,480
draft or the specifications for s i only

869
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,360
allow

870
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,760
um names to get sent it doesn't allow

871
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,200
ipad right

872
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,240
before or v6 addresses to be encoded um

873
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,240
right so this is not possible to have

874
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,640
any sni for these right

875
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,120
and i think we we but i think we need to

876
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,039
have an sni here because some of these

877
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,120
are multi-tenant enough like

878
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
you take the google front end if you

879
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,760
just send it over quite a a practical if

880
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,440
you send to dns google.google a request

881
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,039
you're not going to get back a cert that

882
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,200
contains ip addresses because

883
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,559
those are on

884
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,720
those are sufficiently multi-tenant that

885
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,080
that the server is not going to know

886
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,840
what to apply and that applies to a lot

887
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,640
of other similar services and we what we

888
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,640
do what we want to avoid especially on

889
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,200
the v4 side is people having to have

890
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,039
different ip addresses just to demux

891
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,559
against search again because that

892
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,399
doesn't scale well

893
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,360
so

894
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
although i think that is that is a

895
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,480
consequence of using addresses here

896
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,840
right

897
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,360
and

898
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,799
then ben can confirm but i think you

899
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,120
know these d these google dns resolvers

900
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,720
these do

901
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,919
um

902
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,519
allow access

903
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,320
without sni

904
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,640
if but there's kind of this area once we

905
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,080
start looking at this there's a bunch of

906
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,399
things that start from a

907
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,760
a

908
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,200
i think a starting point i think there's

909
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,799
a starting point of taking a step back

910
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,480
on what is the security properties we're

911
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,320
trying to get to um

912
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,480
but then from there those at the other

913
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,840
end those are practical deployment

914
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,360
considerations we may we should look at

915
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,960
even at least for some of the examples

916
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,200
we're using as to whether or not those

917
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
would actually work in production and

918
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,880
whether or not those are going to be

919
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,000
whether or not they're going to be new

920
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,240
vulnerabilities like the ones that were

921
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,720
suggested that show up could have given

922
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,480
these default um configurations of of

923
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,320
how a number of things provided those

924
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,360
services today work

925
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,799
um

926
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,640
just jumping here make everyone aware of

927
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,600
the time um so uh we'll have about

928
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,480
another

929
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,120
let's say about eight minutes of chat on

930
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,000
this topic left so

931
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,640
probably even say

932
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,120
so i think you got more in the queue

933
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,918
yep watson

934
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,719
i think this proposed i think this

935
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,239
proposal is the best we can do and that

936
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,639
makes me very unhappy because

937
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,239
we're taking this ip address you have

938
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,918
this name flying around that you then

939
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,599
resolve and you don't actually use for

940
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,879
anything

941
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,440
uh and then with sni

942
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,960
you're sort of going to have to send it

943
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,119
to the same

944
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,839
same ips that that name resolves to set

945
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,159
them all up to work static there's just

946
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,918
nowhere around that

947
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,040
and this whole thing if you feel very

948
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,280
sad that we can't use domain names

949
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,280
freely everywhere and have to

950
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,040
stick with ip's i don't see a way around

951
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,119
it because what you're looking for is an

952
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,800
alternate way to read something you only

953
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,280
know by an ip address

954
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,719
and so you've got your got an ip address

955
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,719
as your root as the thing you want to

956
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,040
connect to

957
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,119
all right tom

958
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,119
so

959
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,760
you can hear me i take it so

960
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,000
earlier discussions it seemed to me like

961
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,720
a

962
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,480
an alternative approach would be to

963
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,960
document the security considerations and

964
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,599
don't let servers branch behavior based

965
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,680
on name provided because it's not the

966
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,000
authenticated portion of ddr

967
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,280
um i don't know if that's still amenable

968
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,240
to people because like tommy said this

969
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,359
isn't about

970
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,760
requiring that name be used it's not

971
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,320
forbidding name to be used where ip

972
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,400
address can also be used

973
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
um because ben has a point making an

974
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,160
https connection where we're not

975
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,359
authenticating the host name is is very

976
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,400
odd um ddr itself doesn't require it

977
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,560
because the identity that ddr is

978
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,240
authenticating is the starting ip

979
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,359
address

980
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,400
um in practice i think there'll be two

981
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,720
different things going on uh we're

982
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,800
confirming that ddr recommendation was

983
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,680
solid but we're doing that over an https

984
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,480
connection and i want

985
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,800
whoever gave me the ddr

986
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,760
delegation to tell me the designation to

987
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,960
tell me

988
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,720
the name that i should be

989
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,480
using because i'm not going to have my

990
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,560
https stack not authenticate the

991
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,320
hostname and if the name they provide is

992
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,320
an ip address that's fine but if they

993
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,800
want to provide a name like dns.google

994
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
instead that's fine too

995
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,200
but i totally acknowledge that that name

996
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,359
can be modified by attacker on the path

997
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,560
back

998
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,800
and so not branching on that behavior is

999
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
wise um so i'd be fair adding that

1000
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,400
security consideration but i don't see

1001
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,480
that as a reason to forbid providing a

1002
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,359
name that includes alpha characters

1003
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,119
outside of just ip addresses in that

1004
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,440
target name

1005
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,000
yeah but that that then does put

1006
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,839
requirements on any

1007
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,200
resolver

1008
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,000
that

1009
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,760
supports this yeah okay ben

1010
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,760
all right so

1011
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,320
responding to tommy first um i think

1012
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,839
there's a slight

1013
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,560
miscommunication there so the

1014
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,359
the

1015
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,920
example record that tommy paulie has at

1016
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,000
the top of the slide would be considered

1017
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,640
valid and acceptable as a ddr record

1018
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,720
regardless nobody's

1019
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,119
demanding a change to the contents of

1020
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,000
the

1021
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,760
target name field here

1022
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,000
it's just a question of what the client

1023
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,480
is allowed to do with that information

1024
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,960
as for servers not branching on the

1025
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,200
authority i think to summarize ecker's

1026
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,640
point

1027
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,680
that is currently a very common

1028
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,680
generally allowed behavior and so

1029
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,079
declaring that servers are not allowed

1030
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,880
to do it in the ddr context would be a

1031
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,640
pretty remarkable deviation from the

1032
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,400
rest of http where they are always

1033
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,079
allowed to branch on that

1034
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,599
uh

1035
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,920
i i wanted to quickly say i think the

1036
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,200
ideal solution here might well be to

1037
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,359
enable essentially ip addresses in sni

1038
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,359
that's not a topic for the obd working

1039
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,240
group

1040
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,359
um

1041
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,839
but i think it it might be sort of the

1042
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,800
cleanest solution here

1043
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,720
for cases like

1044
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,960
google like like pod 8

1045
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,079
i mean these like you do not need sni

1046
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,079
for those to work correct

1047
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,240
in any of these addresses so in the

1048
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,480
current configuration my understanding

1049
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,800
is that um

1050
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,680
yeah if you if you send a tls connection

1051
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,359
if you open a tls connection to 888 port

1052
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,040
443

1053
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,960
with no s i you'll get a certificate

1054
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,119
back that includes the coverage of all

1055
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,520
the relevant ip addresses

1056
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,119
that's not the same certificate that

1057
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,800
you'll get if you

1058
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,480
if you try to open that connection to

1059
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,880
www.google.com

1060
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,560
yeah exactly

1061
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,359
uh

1062
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,280
so it depends on the on the host

1063
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,960
configuration if you want more flexible

1064
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,560
virtual hosting then

1065
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,320
i think currently we just don't have the

1066
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,280
ability to do that securely

1067
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,400
um

1068
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,079
and

1069
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,040
uh also just to briefly to the point

1070
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,960
about dopath being

1071
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,720
attack controlled

1072
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,720
this is discussed in the security

1073
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,960
considerations of the

1074
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,599
svcb for dns draft

1075
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,000
and i would welcome improvements to

1076
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,040
those security considerations

1077
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,200
and just to step in here uh from the

1078
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,960
chair i think we're going to close the

1079
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,760
queue after echoer

1080
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,440
too i see the i see the rfc 8738 the

1081
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,520
acme ip identifier validation extension

1082
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,599
does allow ip addresses in sna hostname

1083
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,119
but with a

1084
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,400
suffix of

1085
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,839
ipv with the rpa to create a

1086
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,760
domain name with the ip address so it

1087
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,920
does allow sna hostname extension so

1088
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,839
that should work for this specification

1089
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,040
and

1090
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,520
we should be able to take uh host names

1091
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,800
within the sni host field

1092
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,119
okay that's interesting um it'd be good

1093
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,079
to understand if that is

1094
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,920
why this is the example given in the

1095
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,920
spec in the chat so

1096
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,960
it makes it much easier

1097
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:21,640
all right okay

1098
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,119
right just waiting um

1099
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,440
so uh yeah i think these are a number of

1100
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,640
issues here probably which i feel like

1101
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,680
we're not we're getting we're getting

1102
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,880
we're going to need someone to labor all

1103
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,800
this stuff down um

1104
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,880
there's the issue of like what has to be

1105
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,319
in the certificate there's the issue

1106
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,880
what the client has to say to induce it

1107
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,319
to be in the certificate

1108
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,359
um

1109
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,760
uh would you say like supposing like

1110
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,839
like are there um are there servers

1111
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,640
whatever there are which um you know

1112
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,319
have iper certificates

1113
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,839
um but like don't use them if you don't

1114
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,440
send snipe or something i don't know or

1115
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,599
maybe there aren't any um but like you

1116
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,520
know what what do we have to do they may

1117
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,440
just not be able to use this right now

1118
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,119
yeah exactly it's a matter of saying

1119
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,079
like this is what you have to do if

1120
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,920
you're one of these things right um yeah

1121
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,520
and then there's this question because i

1122
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,240
host right um so i think like those are

1123
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,480
all like kind of separable here um i

1124
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,119
guess one thing i would um i guess one

1125
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,319
thing i would say is at the current

1126
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,400
moment it's really not it's not sensible

1127
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,560
if someone sends you a tls client hello

1128
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,480
and no s and i not just my pdrs

1129
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,280
certificate um if you have one um

1130
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,839
um but if we had to um we could we could

1131
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,680
certainly i mean so you find some way to

1132
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,760
stuff sni in um uh um

1133
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,359
um

1134
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,520
uh uh uh in in the you know um

1135
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,079
sorry uh

1136
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,520
there's an s and i i don't think this

1137
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,359
that opera thing is a good idea but um

1138
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,040
i'm sure you'll find a way to do it um

1139
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,319
another thing you could do is by the way

1140
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,720
just have a fls fly that says um i

1141
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,079
didn't send dress and i but i meant ip

1142
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,400
address right um because we now have

1143
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,520
this purpose so i think that that

1144
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,560
problem is emily soluble um uh

1145
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,000
i would suggest that that's solvable

1146
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,880
outside of the scope of this i i agree

1147
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,040
we used to like scroll call class and do

1148
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,280
something um

1149
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,319
all right i'm done thank you okay cool

1150
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,760
um zeo so that's essentially it um

1151
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,319
it sounds like i'll uh modify the pr to

1152
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,119
just say hey you use

1153
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,560
the ip address um i think it'll just

1154
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,930
simplify the text and

1155
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,200
[Music]

1156
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,560
um i can

1157
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,760
share a link to that on the list i

1158
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,839
believe after that

1159
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,440
then uh we should be ready for working

1160
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,079
group last call

1161
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,400
okay

1162
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,240
well thank you

1163
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,640
uh tommy and thanks everybody for a

1164
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,640
great discussion there

1165
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,040
so next up in the agenda we have a quick

1166
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,640
update from the um

1167
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,160
i think dan is going to do it

1168
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,880
about dnr

1169
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,680
yeah

1170
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,520
the slides are uploaded so i just want

1171
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,240
to

1172
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,040
wrap presentation

1173
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,720
and that's clicking on meeting materials

1174
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,200
at the top

1175
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,520
it's um

1176
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,839
if you see i have a thing to share with

1177
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,240
your lines

1178
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,440
maybe you can show them real quick

1179
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,800
because

1180
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,200
oh there we go

1181
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,560
yeah they don't advance for me so i only

1182
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,040
have uh one thing uh authors uh consider

1183
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,119
this ready for a working group last call

1184
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,520
um i know we were holding off on doing

1185
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,160
that to to do ddr and dnr at the same

1186
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,160
time to make sure that uh

1187
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,599
some of the

1188
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,319
security aspects of both are aligned uh

1189
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,480
and we have no changes to the dock

1190
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,599
but we consider this ready to go

1191
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,319
that's my update

1192
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,720
questions on the dnr yeah

1193
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,119
okay nobody's in the queue

1194
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,359
stan

1195
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,960
and uh uh tail isn't on but we'll talk

1196
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,319
as well to see if we're going to

1197
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,000
continue on with the the plan i still

1198
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,680
like the plan of doing the two together

1199
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,920
so that they're in sync um so i think

1200
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,440
we'll probably hold off working group

1201
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,800
last call uh on dnr until ddr is um

1202
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,319
updated with the current discussions

1203
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:38,079
going on

1204
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,640
okay uh next up on the agenda we have

1205
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,079
um

1206
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,200
who is going to hand

1207
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,480
my agenda slides went away uh we have um

1208
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,319
ben ben schwartz uh discovery of

1209
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,079
designated resolverism presence of

1210
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,920
legacy forwarders

1211
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,920
that's a heck of a

1212
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,240
title

1213
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:05,000
oh request but i'll give it back

1214
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,800
give you approval

1215
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,520
and then you have 10 minutes present and

1216
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,680
five minutes for q a

1217
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,200
okay here we go

1218
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,400
um

1219
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,480
this is a draft

1220
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,440
by

1221
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,520
myself and chris box

1222
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,839
inspired by a lot of discussion by a lot

1223
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,040
of different people in this working

1224
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,560
group who've thought about this topic

1225
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,800
as a refresher the topic in question is

1226
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,800
what to do when the client is speaking

1227
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,240
to a dns forwarder identified by a local

1228
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,800
ip address

1229
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,680
and

1230
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,599
the forwarder is just

1231
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,400
forwarding all the queries to a

1232
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,640
recursive resolver that actually

1233
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,520
supports an encrypted dns protocol

1234
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,319
and so the question is can the client

1235
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,440
upgrade to use dns over tls to this

1236
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,480
recursive resolver

1237
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,760
this is an opportunistic encryption

1238
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,640
situation so the only identity the

1239
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,720
client knows for the dns server is a

1240
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,839
local ip address which is not a usable

1241
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,640
validation identity

1242
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,839
so in this context in ddr when

1243
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:30,480
uh when you're trying to upgrade

1244
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,880
starting with insecure dns

1245
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,440
an active adversary can always win the

1246
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,440
an active adversary between the client

1247
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,319
and

1248
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:41,520
their sort of closest apparent resolver

1249
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,440
can always just drop the ddr queries and

1250
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,359
prevent ddr from ever happening keep the

1251
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,960
client unencrypted and monitor and

1252
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,000
modify their their requests so

1253
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,960
there's no uh real authenticated

1254
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,640
encryption there's no real strong

1255
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,640
security possible here we're only

1256
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,560
talking about shades of opportunistic

1257
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,960
encryption

1258
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,160
so in this context ddr says

1259
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,800
that the client is allowed to upgrade as

1260
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,880
long as the ip address of the encrypted

1261
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,520
resolver does not differ from the ip

1262
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,520
address of the unencrypted resolver so

1263
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,680
they're continuing to send their traffic

1264
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,000
along the same network path they're just

1265
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,280
encrypting it

1266
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,559
and that works so long as the the

1267
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,280
forwarder is

1268
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,720
in a forward or context that works if

1269
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,960
the forwarder is has been upgraded to

1270
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,480
fully implement ddr itself

1271
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,280
but otherwise it it basically excludes

1272
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,880
upgrade across a forwarder

1273
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,240
and we have

1274
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,960
a bunch of reports and and sort of

1275
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,480
experience in the working group that

1276
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,839
says that there are a very large

1277
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,839
fraction of internet users who are

1278
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:53,760
essentially stuck behind one of these

1279
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,920
forwarders where otherwise they would be

1280
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,359
able to use encrypted dns to the

1281
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,240
upstream resolver

1282
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,359
so this draft is an informational draft

1283
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:11,680
we're discussing client policy which uh

1284
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,839
the working group has it's at least a

1285
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,160
challenge to to say normative to make

1286
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,640
normative statements about so this draft

1287
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,400
doesn't attempt to make any normative

1288
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,680
statements about it

1289
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,400
it

1290
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,359
considers a client policy that would

1291
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:26,720
have this

1292
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,880
that would be able to upgrade in this

1293
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,119
context and the key thing that changes

1294
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,119
with this client policy

1295
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:38,160
is that we remove this requirement

1296
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,640
that that the

1297
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,920
ip address appear in the certificate

1298
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,520
if the unencrypted resolver is

1299
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,359
identified by one of these network local

1300
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,680
ip addresses which we know cannot appear

1301
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,480
in a certificate

1302
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,680
so the draft then discusses all of the

1303
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,480
issues that we thought of that this

1304
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,720
raises and there are a lot of serious

1305
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,160
issues that are raised by a client

1306
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,040
policy like this and also discusses a

1307
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,720
bunch of mitigations that can

1308
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,200
at least reduce the severity and in some

1309
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,520
cases you know maybe really fully

1310
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,839
compensate for these concerns

1311
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,319
so first i want to emphasize things that

1312
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,160
don't change between

1313
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,280
that aren't affected by this discussion

1314
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,880
malware and threat main filtering

1315
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,400
services are

1316
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,520
not affected here because they can very

1317
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,800
easily just add resolver.rpa to the list

1318
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,720
of domains that they don't allow access

1319
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,520
to

1320
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,280
that list has to be dynamically

1321
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,079
modifiable because they're chasing an

1322
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,240
evolving threat landscape or an evolving

1323
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,400
set of services that fall into their

1324
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,040
categories so it's it's really

1325
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,440
straightforward for them to

1326
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,920
actually maintain control and prevent

1327
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,440
the cross-forward or upgrade here if

1328
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,520
they want to prevent it

1329
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,440
and also there are there are a lot of

1330
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,000
other things that our people like like

1331
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,240
upstream resolvers doing things on

1332
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,720
behalf of the client that's obviously

1333
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,079
not effective because we're not changing

1334
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,160
which upstream resolver is in use

1335
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,160
but there are some real concerns with

1336
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,720
this um you know clarifying questions

1337
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,319
please um

1338
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,558
neil

1339
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,800
yeah hi um

1340
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,480
i just wondered on the previous one the

1341
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,920
time of use frustrations what do you

1342
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,599
actually mean by that do you mean like

1343
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,839
how long someone's been using a service

1344
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,000
or just when someone's allowed to use a

1345
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,760
service

1346
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,680
both of those things i you know i was

1347
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,440
thinking in in my mind i was thinking

1348
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,839
about things like

1349
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,079
captive portal networks where users pay

1350
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,079
for a time limited access

1351
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,760
or

1352
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,880
family

1353
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,599
controls parental controls that limit

1354
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,920
certain you know devices of no use after

1355
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,440
bedtime

1356
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,680
um okay those kind of things do get

1357
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,359
implemented by dns

1358
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:00,960
certainly the latter one like no use

1359
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,520
after bedtime that kind of stuff

1360
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,000
so i would definitely be interested in

1361
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,160
learning more about the implementation

1362
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,599
examples there

1363
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,760
as we pointed out in the draft

1364
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,839
it's it seems like it can't be

1365
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,119
implemented

1366
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,440
in any effective way using dns because

1367
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,960
clients have substantial amounts of

1368
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,920
caching

1369
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,800
so

1370
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,200
major services like if you're accessing

1371
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,880
i don't know youtube or something

1372
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,240
there's a good chance

1373
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,720
that it's just going to continue to work

1374
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,559
after the dns stuff

1375
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,079
oh sure i'm not i'm not saying

1376
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:33,680
everything it works perfectly i'm just

1377
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,960
saying it does

1378
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,280
these things do these do happen and ttls

1379
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,040
tend to be very low these days so if

1380
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,480
you're browsing it but i'm sure there's

1381
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,319
some services once you've got the ip

1382
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:43,920
address particularly videos jimmy though

1383
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,599
it's going to continue to work but i'm

1384
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,359
just saying they do work but i guess

1385
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:48,800
that i would put them in the same

1386
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,880
categories as malware and threat domain

1387
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,400
filtering at that point anyway because

1388
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,960
if if they're being done by dns then

1389
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,800
the answer is the same which is just add

1390
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,000
resolver to output to the list

1391
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:02,960
okay

1392
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,760
um

1393
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,200
that's great if you happen to have an

1394
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,760
example of a of a system that

1395
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,520
is implemented that way that would be

1396
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,160
interesting but yeah this weekend

1397
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,760
i can send you

1398
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,960
thank you some examples

1399
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,960
um can we hold the rest of the queue and

1400
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,640
let ben get through the rest of the

1401
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,480
slides i think you're almost done ben

1402
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,920
right wise

1403
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,839
yeah yeah

1404
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,000
okay

1405
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,200
so um this does raise some concerns um

1406
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,599
one of the concerns here is that

1407
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,440
somebody injected a long-lived ddr

1408
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,280
response appeared on the network for a

1409
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,160
few minutes injected a

1410
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,880
long-lived ddr response that redirects

1411
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,119
everybody to their server and then walks

1412
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,599
away um they can their attack can

1413
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,520
continue after they cease to be present

1414
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,920
and so there are some potential that

1415
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,000
that's a real concern and there are some

1416
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,520
mitigations that can reduce the

1417
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,559
surveillance

1418
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,480
of that concern one

1419
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,880
one way to mitigate it would be to limit

1420
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,400
how long you cache these records

1421
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,559
essentially cap the ttl

1422
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,720
another possible mitigation would be to

1423
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,280
essentially only accept an upgrade

1424
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,599
an unauthenticated upgrade in this case

1425
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,240
to a target that you have some

1426
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,400
reputation signal forward you believe

1427
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,440
that they're

1428
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,960
not likely to be part of an attack

1429
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,680
another class of security concerns is

1430
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,119
related to how this interacts with

1431
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,280
forensic logging so the draft has some

1432
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,400
advice on

1433
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,200
how to configure forensic logging

1434
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,280
to to make sure that you can still

1435
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,680
capture any attacks that might happen

1436
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,599
and there are also some interesting

1437
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,920
compatibility impacts that could arise

1438
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,240
if a client tried to do this so split

1439
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,760
horizon namespaces are a little bit like

1440
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,760
a little bit like the threat

1441
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,119
domain filtering that we talked about

1442
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:52,960
earlier but they're not necessarily

1443
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,040
dynamic a forwarder could have been

1444
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,559
configured with the same split horizon

1445
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,680
namespace 10 years ago and never touched

1446
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,240
since we want to make sure that we don't

1447
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,040
break those configurations and so

1448
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,119
there are ways to solve this um or at

1449
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,200
least there are nations that can can

1450
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,760
avoid visible break in situations like

1451
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,559
this

1452
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,319
and one mitigation we mentioned in the

1453
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:17,359
draft is nx domain fallback so

1454
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,280
try to look up the domain through the

1455
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,680
upstream resolver but if it fails you

1456
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,400
can disable encrypted dns and try again

1457
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,720
through the through the network's

1458
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,880
unencrypted resolver

1459
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,839
that's

1460
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,839
um that bears quite a bit of resemblance

1461
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,839
to behaviors that exist today in both

1462
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,960
chrome and firefox

1463
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,359
there's some interesting questions

1464
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,559
around

1465
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,200
safe search type domains which we coined

1466
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,839
the term interposable domains

1467
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,920
for these domains that are deliberately

1468
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,520
meant to be modified by resolvers in

1469
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,920
particular ways again that

1470
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,760
that might have been done 10 years ago

1471
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,119
once and we don't want to break those

1472
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,200
configurations with a with any client

1473
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,400
side changes that would be a problem so

1474
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,280
uh there's some discussion of

1475
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,920
do about that best the best mitigation

1476
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,319
that i thought of was just to basically

1477
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,799
keep track of the very small number of

1478
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:16,160
of these weird things that are out there

1479
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,359
uh and avoid breaking them

1480
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:22,400
and let's

1481
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,640
so

1482
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,000
uh

1483
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,680
this draft it documents a a secure at

1484
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,599
least an alternative client policy that

1485
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:32,720
is no

1486
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,559
it is in some sense no less secure

1487
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,280
than ddr itself um

1488
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,559
or at least

1489
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,960
secure under similar

1490
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,640
threat modeling

1491
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,119
um it documents the advantages and

1492
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,119
disadvantages that that client policy

1493
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:50,240
would carry

1494
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,079
and it discusses some ways to mitigate

1495
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,880
the known problems

1496
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,640
it doesn't have any

1497
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,480
recommendations on

1498
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,319
what you should do uh

1499
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,319
and it's uh it's seeking working group

1500
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,720
adoption one thing that i i guess i just

1501
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,520
skipped reading the slide is that

1502
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,920
this alternative client policy while it

1503
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,319
carries a bunch of tricky trade-offs

1504
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,040
would likely enable a lot more ddr

1505
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,599
upgrades so it would it would be likely

1506
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:22,480
to result in a large increase in the

1507
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,319
amount of encrypted dns on the internet

1508
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:28,480
uh thanks let's open for questions

1509
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,480
vinnie

1510
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:35,520
example and i think chris

1511
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,359
verified this in chat

1512
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:40,559
that the blocking really only applies to

1513
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,200
being done at the forwarder because

1514
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,119
you never know if that request is

1515
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,960
actually making it to a cloud-based

1516
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,400
malware

1517
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,640
inspection service right it could be man

1518
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,200
in the middle before then so

1519
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,160
uh

1520
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,319
yeah this comment here i think

1521
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,640
only applies if the forwarder itself is

1522
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,839
uh providing that service right

1523
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:05,760
uh i'm not sure

1524
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,440
i'm not sure what you're referring to

1525
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,599
but in general if threat filtering is

1526
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,760
implemented at the resolver then it can

1527
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,440
continue to do that just by adding

1528
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,520
resolver.arpa to its list

1529
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,280
and if threat filtering is implemented

1530
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,400
upstream

1531
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,119
of the forwarder then that also won't be

1532
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,119
affected because users will continue to

1533
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:27,240
reach the same upstream resolver

1534
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,480
does that help

1535
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,160
but not in the case of an on path

1536
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,240
attacker right

1537
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,480
like if there's something between the

1538
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,960
forwarder

1539
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,359
sorry go ahead so we're talking here

1540
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:43,119
about legacy forwarders which means

1541
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:44,160
they're not

1542
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,839
in the context of this draft means that

1543
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,920
they're in general not modifying queries

1544
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,400
on either leg so an on path attacker on

1545
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,079
either section of the path can always

1546
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,559
prevent the ddr upgrade just by dropping

1547
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:57,119
the ddr query or response

1548
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,040
right but the client doesn't know that

1549
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,680
there's a forwarder between it and

1550
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,760
the final destination right and the

1551
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,680
proposal here is to

1552
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,839
soften

1553
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:10,319
the security requirements of essentially

1554
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:12,960
the client to support this

1555
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,520
or did i misunderstand yes that's right

1556
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,559
um so this does impact other uses of ddr

1557
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,799
it impacts the client security generally

1558
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,119
and the draft walks through

1559
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,520
the implications of that but it only

1560
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,000
applies when the apparent resolver is

1561
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,119
identified by a local ip address

1562
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:33,920
which means that authenticated security

1563
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:38,640
is not really possible uh anyway

1564
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,040
barbara

1565
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:45,839
um thanks again for doing this draft ben

1566
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:46,799
um

1567
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:50,160
i think it's important i i would like to

1568
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,480
see this worked further

1569
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,599
um

1570
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,000
i don't know if it's something that

1571
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,040
would

1572
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,319
ever make it out of the last call but i

1573
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,559
definitely would like to see it continue

1574
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:04,400
getting discussed and so i would like to

1575
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,720
see it be adopted

1576
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,160
um i know that's one of the questions

1577
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,760
you have um

1578
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,240
of course we have been discussing about

1579
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,450
some of the ipv6 um

1580
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,920
[Music]

1581
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,240
issues and things like that and yeah i

1582
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,160
just think these need to continue to be

1583
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,680
discussed and

1584
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,280
this gives me

1585
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,319
some hope that we might find some sort

1586
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:27,680
of way

1587
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,480
that

1588
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,359
devices behind forwarders could get

1589
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,480
upgraded

1590
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,799
thanks

1591
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,160
i think kira is next thank you

1592
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:47,280
have ben uh i think this is a good start

1593
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,799
with regard to

1594
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:51,280
the millions of uh legacy routers that

1595
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,040
are there but i think i think it should

1596
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,799
i think we need more lot more details to

1597
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:55,839
be discussed in the security

1598
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:57,839
constitution especially with these

1599
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:00,640
legacy uh routers where even the config

1600
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,720
cannot be updated and that's the case

1601
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,359
this draft is addressing and

1602
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:06,880
even if the config cannot be updated

1603
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,400
then it seems like

1604
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,839
if with these home routers they're

1605
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,160
easily susceptible to several firmware

1606
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,160
vulnerabilities and typically they have

1607
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,160
several firmware upgrades to address

1608
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,280
those vulnerabilities if those

1609
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,359
vulnerabilities are not getting fixed

1610
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:21,680
then um to support that kind of a

1611
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,240
deployment right i mean is it like we're

1612
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,480
going to do this till 2025 and start

1613
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,040
stop supporting this model how where is

1614
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,319
the

1615
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:32,400
end game for this right i understand

1616
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,240
it's it's the starting point because we

1617
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,839
have to transition to

1618
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:38,160
better routers but are we gonna do this

1619
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,599
for some duration and then stop

1620
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:43,839
supporting this as a stock gap

1621
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,720
so that's an interesting question

1622
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,280
the draft does not propose particularly

1623
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,599
a need to sunset this kind of behavior

1624
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,640
again no normative recommendation client

1625
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,839
policy

1626
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:59,200
but

1627
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,079
uh

1628
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:01,520
i i think it's

1629
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,680
it's conceivable that the need for this

1630
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,400
could fall over time

1631
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,720
i don't know

1632
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,880
thanks man

1633
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,760
and i'll close the uh the cue after

1634
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,079
andrew

1635
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,160
yeah so ben thanks for thanks for doing

1636
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,680
this this has got a bunch of interesting

1637
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,000
sort of implications

1638
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,200
but i suspect that people are going to

1639
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,400
be doing this

1640
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,599
exact

1641
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:32,160
behavior and it will serve a very large

1642
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,280
number of people and provide them with

1643
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,359
some amount of encryption i don't know

1644
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:40,400
how good it is because obviously this is

1645
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,119
vulnerable to on path attackers

1646
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,200
and mr points out

1647
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,040
one of those on path attackers is the

1648
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,200
unpatched router that hasn't been

1649
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:54,319
updated report this stuff um

1650
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,400
but it's certainly not worse than it was

1651
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,839
before

1652
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:58,880
in in

1653
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,440
any way and so i'd like to see his work

1654
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,480
on this i don't think we need to set the

1655
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,280
bar particularly high when it comes to

1656
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,599
making sure that everything across the

1657
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,520
board is is covered in the security

1658
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,880
considerations

1659
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,880
um particularly because that increases

1660
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,880
her exposure to the sorts of things that

1661
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,440
barbara mentioned i'd be interested in

1662
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,760
why barbara thinks that this might not

1663
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,839
get through a last call i realize that

1664
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:25,760
these sorts of things are

1665
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,200
always a little bit

1666
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,960
interesting but i'd

1667
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,640
be interested in what those exact

1668
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:34,038
reasons were

1669
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,720
thanks martin

1670
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,680
ray great

1671
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,640
yeah hi um thanks ben um a couple of

1672
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,799
things i noticed both with this draft

1673
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:49,039
and the previous discussed draft in our

1674
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:51,359
draft um i think they could both do with

1675
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,200
both sets of authors could do a looking

1676
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,079
at my rfc 5625 which was specifically

1677
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:57,039
about

1678
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,160
uh the

1679
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,760
cluster dns proxies found in home

1680
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,960
gateways

1681
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,839
um specifically i think for your draft

1682
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,480
one of the biggest issues may be that

1683
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,480
actually most of these proxies or

1684
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,240
forwarders are not true forwarders in

1685
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,400
the dns sense at all

1686
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,680
but are actually just simple udp algs

1687
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,599
application rate gateways they actually

1688
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,359
don't really speak the dns protocol at

1689
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:21,440
all they just forward it over udp up to

1690
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,039
an upstream device

1691
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,960
and send the responses back

1692
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,000
um

1693
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,200
the other comment which is probably more

1694
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,680
relevant to the dnr draft but i missed

1695
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,920
that session of the meeting

1696
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,240
was that a lot of the time the upstream

1697
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,280
device

1698
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,680
does not know what the upstream dns is

1699
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,039
going to be

1700
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:41,680
uh at the same time

1701
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,680
in readiness for the client to connect

1702
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,000
like clients are online all the time as

1703
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,359
long as they've got power

1704
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:49,520
um but if ppp session drops which is

1705
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,480
quite common over dsl type home gateways

1706
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,400
um there simply is no upstream dhcp

1707
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,440
information to have to be had

1708
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,640
so um

1709
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,000
say that's probably more for the dnr

1710
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,400
draft than for this one but i would very

1711
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,680
strongly recommend both authors have a

1712
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,240
look at that previous rfc and do get

1713
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,000
back to me please if you um want any

1714
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,160
further details on that research i did

1715
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,480
thank you

1716
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,000
andrew

1717
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,319
hi yeah uh

1718
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:23,920
two things firstly a few people on the

1719
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,440
list have been commented about or this

1720
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,720
will time out

1721
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,480
as cpe

1722
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,319
is replaced

1723
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:32,880
which is probably true

1724
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,960
but i would politely suggest that maybe

1725
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,640
some people are completely

1726
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,200
overestimating how quickly the vast

1727
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,480
majority of the market replaces its cpe

1728
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,760
um

1729
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,839
those of us familiar with isps will know

1730
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:48,480
that uh consumer customers you know

1731
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,880
you're lucky to get them to change

1732
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,680
uh we're in a 10-year time frame that's

1733
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,359
not because the isp doesn't want to

1734
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:58,160
change that's because the consumers

1735
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,559
have got a lot of inertia you can send

1736
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:02,000
them free stuff and they won't

1737
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,079
necessarily unwrap it let alone switch

1738
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:05,599
it on

1739
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:06,880
so this isn't a problem that's just

1740
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,920
going to disappear in 12 months you know

1741
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,760
most people don't have the budgeting of

1742
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,079
a of a tech firm

1743
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:15,760
and i think we need to consider that

1744
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,680
yeah this is a long-term hardware

1745
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,240
problem not a software problem

1746
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,440
and the other thing which we shouldn't

1747
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,079
overlook overlook either um yeah let's

1748
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:26,400
remind ourselves this is 85 of the

1749
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,520
market

1750
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:31,359
um yeah this is a non-trivial thing

1751
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:34,240
um if we don't do this or something like

1752
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,280
this

1753
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,160
um then we're really just doing a caller

1754
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,680
case so i think this is tremendously

1755
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,359
important that we come up to a solution

1756
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:43,760
here thanks

1757
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,359
thank you andrew

1758
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:47,440
um one thing i'll quickly say is that

1759
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,440
there might even be cases in the

1760
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,839
indefinite future for this

1761
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:53,440
if you imagine

1762
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,920
a a forwarder that really wants to get

1763
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,000
out of the way is trying to get out of

1764
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,280
the way

1765
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,280
it might actually want clients to do

1766
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,640
this kind of cross-forward or upgrade

1767
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,039
but we can talk about that later back to

1768
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:08,400
you glenn

1769
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,359
okay thank you ben um you know by the

1770
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:13,839
way i'll comment i think this is a

1771
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:16,160
having these smaller drafts that we can

1772
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,319
focus on issues around this um this is a

1773
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:19,920
great way to work through and resolve

1774
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:20,960
them so

1775
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:21,839
um

1776
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:24,799
thanks to both you and and chris for

1777
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:26,640
putting this one together and letting us

1778
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,240
talk to us because we've been

1779
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,520
touching this issue for quite a while

1780
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,200
now so it's good to see

1781
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,400
us

1782
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,280
making progress on it so thank you

1783
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,839
um next up we have uh two um

1784
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:41,839
we've had this discussion around a

1785
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:44,640
couple of drafts that we have issued a

1786
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,880
working group adoption around

1787
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,640
and uh

1788
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,760
we have low feedback on the list

1789
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,520
uh and so the chairs have been trying to

1790
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,760
work through

1791
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,280
the right

1792
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,319
i'm getting a lot of echo one second

1793
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:02,240
dan could you mute yourself okay thank

1794
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,400
you um

1795
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,520
and and so the chairs have been trying

1796
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,559
to work through

1797
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:08,319
what the right path here and we're

1798
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,680
looking for direction for the group

1799
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:10,960
because ultimately it's the working

1800
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,440
group that decides what gets adopted and

1801
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:14,880
what we work on

1802
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,880
so the first one we're going to do here

1803
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,280
is we're going to talk about the uh

1804
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,079
split verizon dns configuration

1805
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,839
and uh let's keep the the top focus

1806
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:27,440
right there what we're really looking

1807
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,559
for here is um

1808
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:33,200
not to turn this session into like a

1809
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,520
debate on you do we adopt do we not

1810
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,000
adopt but let's talk about

1811
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,240
the document and you know

1812
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,240
is this something that the group feels

1813
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,680
that we should

1814
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,799
uh be you know uh you know ultimately

1815
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:48,480
adopting um

1816
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,400
or not you know what what are your

1817
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,839
feelings on that and then ultimately

1818
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:54,000
we're gonna you know we have the

1819
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,799
request uh for adoption out on the list

1820
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,599
still

1821
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:58,480
and

1822
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,160
ultimately we're looking for a feedback

1823
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,480
you know here and there and then we'll

1824
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,559
try to figure out if if we move forward

1825
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:06,000
with one or boulder either of these

1826
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,880
drafts okay with that said um who's

1827
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,039
gonna talk uh to this little horizon dns

1828
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:12,480
config

1829
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,760
is that is that dan

1830
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:17,279
okay

1831
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,279
do you want me to run the slide again or

1832
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,600
do you want to do it on your end

1833
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,120
yeah let's do that i was gonna switch

1834
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,279
computers to try to resolve the audio

1835
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:27,679
but i didn't get the other system set up

1836
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:28,640
so

1837
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,080
hopefully you're also trying to figure

1838
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,960
out the slides sorry

1839
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:35,759
okay

1840
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:39,719
thanks

1841
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:55,759
double getting that particular slide

1842
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,279
i imported them give me one second here

1843
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:05,239
my apologies for the

1844
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:08,960
it's not liking things

1845
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,040
yeah no no hang on

1846
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,120
a while leave it for a second make it

1847
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,600
meat echo takes a good 15 seconds before

1848
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,159
slides appear

1849
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,839
no it's

1850
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:21,920
that i i added them to the queue of

1851
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,158
things to present

1852
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:26,319
but it seems to have disappeared out of

1853
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:30,399
the queue or i i can't scroll anymore so

1854
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,000
um

1855
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,799
give me a second here

1856
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,158
i'm doing really badly here

1857
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:48,719
yeah perhaps the pdf renderer is

1858
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:51,120
confused with the pdf

1859
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,520
no the problem is that there's a list of

1860
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,120
documents which have been imported to

1861
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,400
the session

1862
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,480
and i imported all the ones ahead of

1863
01:09:58,480 --> 01:09:59,440
this

1864
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,760
and now it's not showing up in there in

1865
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,679
this particular document

1866
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:05,920
okay

1867
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:11,480
and i don't remember how i imported it

1868
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:22,520
let me try this one

1869
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,800
okay we're gonna try the old-fashioned

1870
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,800
way

1871
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:53,400
hey i'm writing your problems

1872
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:04,320
all right can you see the slides

1873
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:09,760
yes

1874
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,000
okay

1875
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,000
all right maybe maybe the echo will be

1876
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,360
better too

1877
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,719
let me let me know

1878
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:21,199
okay yeah

1879
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:25,440
yep uh go to slide two um so the uh

1880
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,280
so the last time we presented this was

1881
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,600
last itf uh it was version four we're

1882
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,239
now at version seven um

1883
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,080
removed a little bit of latent text that

1884
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,520
was accidentally in there talking about

1885
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,960
the enterprise use cases so uh this is

1886
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,280
and and has been intended for a couple

1887
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,040
of versions now to cover

1888
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,920
uh non-enterprise use cases specifically

1889
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,400
uh for mobile isps wanting their

1890
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,719
subscribers to to be able to get to

1891
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:53,280
certain resources and you know pay their

1892
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,960
bill and whatever

1893
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:55,920
um

1894
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,239
and thanks to a comment from paul

1895
01:11:58,239 --> 01:11:59,360
we added

1896
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,679
better support for handling geographic

1897
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:03,920
sub-domains for split horizon where

1898
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,320
there's a

1899
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,560
country name or a city name or something

1900
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,520
in the dns server name which is pretty

1901
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,560
common

1902
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,600
um and then uh glenn wanted an example

1903
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,920
um message flow so that's on the next

1904
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,360
slide so

1905
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,440
we added text in the document and in the

1906
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,760
next slide and ascii art and beautiful

1907
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,520
ascii art

1908
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,360
into the document

1909
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:31,040
as well so next slide please fine

1910
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,320
so this shows

1911
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,760
what we're doing the green stuff at the

1912
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,120
bottom is

1913
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,679
what's new the rest of it is exercise

1914
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:43,040
existing specifications so steps one

1915
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,440
through seven are exercise existing

1916
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,040
specifications

1917
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,840
uh then what we're proposing in the

1918
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,400
document to do differently is after

1919
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,719
gathering the information from steps one

1920
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:56,480
through seven which is what are the

1921
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,480
local dnr host names what are their ip

1922
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,440
addresses and what's the fqdn for the

1923
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,679
the provisioning domain and learning the

1924
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,280
details of the provisioning domain and

1925
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,120
getting that json back after getting all

1926
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,520
that stuff in steps one through seven is

1927
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:12,000
go off and talk to the public to a

1928
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,440
public resolver

1929
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:17,040
and ask it who owns that domain and see

1930
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,920
that there's a match

1931
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,239
if there is a match then continue using

1932
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:24,400
that network encrypted resolver that

1933
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,800
claimed to be authoritative for that

1934
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,520
domain and claim to be

1935
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,000
responsible for it and use it for that

1936
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,640
domain and and that's that's the the

1937
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,920
gist of of what we're proposing

1938
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,120
and

1939
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,440
that's really my update i have a another

1940
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,440
slide we may want to just foot back and

1941
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,960
forth between this one and the last one

1942
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,199
to help frame the discussion

1943
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:50,800
but the last slide that i have is

1944
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,800
does this describe a real problem do we

1945
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,840
want to have strong authentication and

1946
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,800
authorization of horizon dns

1947
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,920
and is this mechanism reasonable and i

1948
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,920
think there are two separate questions

1949
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,719
um this is just the mechanism we thought

1950
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:08,880
was reasonable

1951
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:09,760
and

1952
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:10,800
go

1953
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,159
paul

1954
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:14,320
and let me make one comment from

1955
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,040
the chair of you uh is i believe that

1956
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,560
you know there's

1957
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,400
we're gonna if we do adopt it it will

1958
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,040
get renamed so people are upset with the

1959
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,880
word enterprise in there i think there

1960
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,640
was general agreement that we're

1961
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,040
enterprise we get removed in a renamed

1962
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,199
adopted version

1963
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:32,400
i agree

1964
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,280
so all right let's go to the queue

1965
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,719
okay paul speaking

1966
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:39,679
um so i'm still a little confused about

1967
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:41,760
the relationship of the

1968
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,880
split dns that is not in the public view

1969
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,360
and sort of asking the public few for

1970
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,800
confirmation that this non-global space

1971
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,239
exists

1972
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:54,159
because if you're asking a public server

1973
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:56,000
if it exists and you get a confirmation

1974
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,320
it exists then it's not a private space

1975
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,719
anymore so then why is anything needed

1976
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:02,719
at all especially if you're not talking

1977
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:05,120
about an enterprise split but about like

1978
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,199
some custom portaling page

1979
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:09,280
then didn't they just put it in public

1980
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:14,320
dns so then why do you need this split

1981
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:17,280
so a lot of enterprises enjoy doing this

1982
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,120
split so that they only have their

1983
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,199
public servers on the public dns as we

1984
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:22,640
know and they

1985
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,080
have all of their thousands and

1986
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,719
thousands of private domains on their

1987
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:28,719
their split horizon dns that are only

1988
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:31,840
accessible internally um

1989
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,320
and that's how lots of enterprises have

1990
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:38,559
enjoyed deploying their dns you know

1991
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,040
okay so so then you're talking about the

1992
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,840
enterprise split dns and so then i agree

1993
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,920
that there's lots of domains internal

1994
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,400
only but then i don't understand how you

1995
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,679
can ask a public server on the internet

1996
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,920
about these domains that only exist

1997
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,760
internally

1998
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:56,480
so

1999
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,320
there's two possible answers when we've

2000
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,480
asked the public uh

2001
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:01,840
dns

2002
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,800
about a domain one is it doesn't exist

2003
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,719
in which case yes it's internal only and

2004
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,800
only exists internally it's some some

2005
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,719
fictitious name like

2006
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:13,920
cortada for uh microsoft for example

2007
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,480
that doesn't exist on the public dns

2008
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,520
or it's a split domain where it does

2009
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,679
exist in the public dns and the answers

2010
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:23,040
that come back on the public are

2011
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,159
different than the answers that come

2012
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,960
back on the the internal on the private

2013
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,159
in which case

2014
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:30,000
that's where we're trying to find this

2015
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,040
match

2016
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,679
that we have described and that is a

2017
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:36,480
split dns

2018
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,600
so so i guess then i'm i'm worried about

2019
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,199
things like um

2020
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:43,679
isps doing typos squading on other

2021
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:45,679
domains that are similar to things they

2022
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:48,400
don't control or something but um i

2023
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,560
guess i still don't fully i still don't

2024
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,080
fully understand the use case and the

2025
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,640
authentication but i'll i'll i'll i'll

2026
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,719
take my stuff further to the list

2027
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:58,320
so okay um

2028
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,400
so this is intended to detect that

2029
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,320
someone is trying to type a squat and

2030
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,400
prevent that from happening and have

2031
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,239
this be have this cause

2032
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:09,040
a failure that the local

2033
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,120
network that is claiming to own let's

2034
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,840
say apple.com and it's uh starbucks you

2035
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,159
know and something weird is going on on

2036
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:19,040
purpose at the starbucks

2037
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,679
we can prove that it does not own

2038
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:25,199
apple.com and it it should not have the

2039
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,920
split dns queries sent to the local

2040
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,880
starbucks name server that someone is

2041
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,480
advertising there with

2042
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,560
you know their ssid and their raspberry

2043
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,640
pi sitting in the corner or whatever is

2044
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,880
to detect that very case and prevent

2045
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,679
that from happening

2046
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,920
so so one comment on that dan maybe that

2047
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,280
might be something that could be added

2048
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,440
as some uh additional security

2049
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,800
description text

2050
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,400
within the draft

2051
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,679
okay agreed it's not in there

2052
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:59,000
okay watson

2053
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:06,960
hi watson clever i am very confused by

2054
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,880
the at first i don't think split split

2055
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,239
that's a good idea you don't need it it

2056
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:14,560
conflates name visibility and being able

2057
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,560
to access servers and that's not how the

2058
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,000
internet works

2059
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,800
and then with this draft i have the same

2060
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,400
confusion as paul

2061
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,800
if you have a

2062
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,239
public if you have a namespace that's

2063
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:29,440
public

2064
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,719
and you're just trying to get your

2065
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:32,239
result

2066
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:33,679
answer you know by using a public

2067
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:35,679
recovery for this why can't you tell

2068
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:37,520
your client to go to a already set up

2069
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:40,640
with the dns already and it's an

2070
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,040
occasional thing it's just sort of

2071
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,199
odd so i'm not sure you know i think

2072
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:46,800
there's a lot of

2073
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,360
problems with a mechanism

2074
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,719
that's saying we're going to end up

2075
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:52,400
different answers through public

2076
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,560
resolvers or notice that our name

2077
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,040
servers are we get back from the public

2078
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,239
because you don't get the names from

2079
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:00,239
public customers you get the answer back

2080
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:01,840
so if you're only you're going to do the

2081
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,280
crawling of dns yourself you don't

2082
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,040
really have a problem or maybe i'm just

2083
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,920
misunderstanding this entirely

2084
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,679
okay so you're saying it uh there isn't

2085
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:14,719
a real problem to solve and

2086
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:16,800
i i believe is what you're saying oh i'm

2087
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,800
saying

2088
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,480
if what you're doing

2089
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,360
involved if the problem is that you're

2090
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,520
using a public recursive you're not

2091
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,600
going to get between us that way

2092
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,920
if you're using a private recursion you

2093
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,760
don't have a problem private recurser

2094
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,760
understand it is talking to authorities

2095
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,640
that give it to split view

2096
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,400
okay

2097
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:46,679
tommy

2098
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,760
all right um

2099
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:52,560
and

2100
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,640
i i think this is definitely a real

2101
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,040
problem um for better or worse you know

2102
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,040
i i care a lot about how we handle split

2103
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,640
dns

2104
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,640
paul and i wrote a document for how to

2105
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,520
do it in ip2 um so i think it's

2106
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,280
i think the answer to the first one is

2107
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:10,320
yes there is a real problem here

2108
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,800
i'm not quite sure about the solution

2109
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,639
and i think more importantly for the

2110
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:16,080
question of adoption and this is what i

2111
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,520
brought up on the list

2112
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,320
i i'm wondering still where this belongs

2113
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,719
it seems like this is a bigger

2114
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:24,000
uh

2115
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,080
thing to tackle than just what we're

2116
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,719
doing in add um 80d is how we're doing

2117
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:30,880
discovery of resolvers

2118
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,280
this is going into a much bigger

2119
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,320
question about how a network expresses

2120
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,960
authority over specific resources which

2121
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,239
is really interesting but that could

2122
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:41,760
have its own working group to talk about

2123
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,320
all the details there um

2124
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,560
you know i like the idea of using pvds

2125
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:47,920
somewhere in this

2126
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,360
pvds was done in into area um and we we

2127
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,360
need some of that audience

2128
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,199
to do the work not just what we have in

2129
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:56,480
80d

2130
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:59,040
okay um and then

2131
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:03,040
just to the solution a little bit

2132
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:06,080
i think the case where you have

2133
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,560
uh you know a purely private name

2134
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,719
or a private domain which i think this

2135
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:12,639
tries to address i don't see that as too

2136
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:15,040
much of a hard scenario so you know

2137
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,960
we're already using

2138
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:20,560
um encrypted dns for our um

2139
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,040
icloud private relay service with apple

2140
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,880
and we fail over

2141
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,719
for non-public names if you try to get

2142
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:29,440
to some resource on the internal

2143
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,679
mobile network that doesn't

2144
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:34,080
uh resolve we try it publicly and then

2145
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,719
we try it locally um and by policy that

2146
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:38,719
can work there are easy ways to have

2147
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:40,719
clients work around that the biggest

2148
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:43,520
problem i i've seen it keeps coming back

2149
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,120
up again and again

2150
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:48,320
that things like v2 split dns could fix

2151
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,120
is how you handle dual facing servers

2152
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,639
that have dual resolving right like i

2153
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:55,199
have a name which is public

2154
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:57,040
and when i'm at the cafe i want it to

2155
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,560
resolve one way but then i'm on my

2156
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,480
internal network and it resolves to the

2157
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,920
internal version of the web page and i

2158
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,440
hate that that exists

2159
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,719
but it does exist and that is the

2160
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,639
hardest problem so if

2161
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:08,080
i think that's the type of thing we need

2162
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,679
to solve

2163
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:11,520
in this space and i think it's

2164
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,639
it's harder

2165
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:14,880
than what we have so far here so i want

2166
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,639
to see the work continue but we need

2167
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:18,560
more work

2168
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:21,120
okay so so then tommy let me clarify

2169
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,360
what your point is you're saying that

2170
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,120
it's an important problem

2171
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:28,400
do the work but don't do an edd do it in

2172
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,199
a bigger context

2173
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:34,639
we need to bring in

2174
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,760
and

2175
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,600
instead of saying this is how you dns

2176
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,199
within add we need to

2177
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:40,480
kind of turn the problem on its head and

2178
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,639
like how do we do this

2179
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:44,800
type of discovery of authority on a

2180
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:47,120
network

2181
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,920
okay

2182
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:53,840
thanks uh ben

2183
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,320
hi

2184
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,920
uh

2185
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,760
so

2186
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,120
okay i i'm broadly supportive of this

2187
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,360
draft i view it as a harm reduction sort

2188
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,960
of case i don't

2189
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,159
i really don't like split dns

2190
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:11,840
and i would i would prefer to just get

2191
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,440
rid of it but

2192
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,600
we if we accept that we're not going to

2193
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,000
get rid of split dns then i think we

2194
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,600
need to provide

2195
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:23,120
better guidance about how it is that you

2196
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,719
prove to

2197
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:27,360
your uh to the members of your network

2198
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,159
that they're actually getting valid

2199
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:31,920
answers and that they're they're going

2200
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,080
to get valid answers that that they need

2201
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,280
to

2202
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,040
that it's secure and appropriate for

2203
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:37,840
them

2204
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,280
to be

2205
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,239
um

2206
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:42,159
to be connecting to particular servers

2207
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:46,239
to get answers for particular names

2208
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,920
and i think this draft actually achieves

2209
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:48,639
that

2210
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,080
uh so

2211
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,920
i think it's it's worth moving forward

2212
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,560
with for that reason i do think that

2213
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:55,520
uh

2214
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,960
there are two as you pointed out there

2215
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,800
are two separate solutions here and

2216
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,560
essentially for these two cases one of

2217
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,600
which for names that truly do not exist

2218
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,520
in the public dns

2219
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,400
really that means non-existent tlds

2220
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,360
because

2221
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,679
otherwise the the draft effectively

2222
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:14,800
requires you to

2223
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:19,199
uh effectively requires you to prove

2224
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:21,199
the

2225
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:22,880
well and i guess i should re-read it

2226
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:23,920
again and see but there are

2227
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,159
fundamentally two cases one of which is

2228
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:28,080
the name exists in the public dns and

2229
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,960
one of which is the the name doesn't

2230
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,000
exist

2231
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,159
so

2232
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,400
if you're talking about cases where the

2233
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,800
name does not exist in the public dns

2234
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,159
that's the case where annex domain

2235
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,199
fallback

2236
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:43,520
as tommy paulie mentioned already

2237
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,000
handles quite well it's also the case

2238
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,719
that creates the risk of typo squatting

2239
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:50,719
that paul routers

2240
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:51,840
pointed out

2241
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,679
i think it would be worth considering

2242
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:55,440
removing that from this draft and

2243
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:58,480
focusing on the hard case the

2244
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,040
the case where the name potentially does

2245
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,600
exist in the public dns but you still

2246
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,239
want users to resolve it differently

2247
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:08,639
on your network

2248
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:10,880
i think that the mention the discussion

2249
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:13,600
of use of public resolvers while it's

2250
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,159
very practical i think is raising a lot

2251
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:18,480
of hairs on on people's necks and is not

2252
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,239
actually necessary i think it would be

2253
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:22,639
clearer if the draft

2254
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:25,360
based that entirely in dns sec and the

2255
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,120
draft can be done without any discussion

2256
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,920
of public resolvers if you um

2257
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,840
or at least without any reliance on them

2258
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,120
if you

2259
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,840
if you just if you say that the

2260
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,760
authentication of the relationship

2261
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:38,719
between

2262
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:42,000
the covered name and the local resolver

2263
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,800
is is based in dnssec

2264
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,639
and then you know if people want to

2265
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:49,120
delegate dnsec validation to a trusted

2266
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,040
third party that's their business we

2267
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:55,199
don't have to tell them to do that

2268
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:56,080
uh

2269
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,159
so so overall i'm supportive but i think

2270
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:00,320
the draft needs a lot of work and may

2271
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,639
not be ready for adoption

2272
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:03,679
but that doesn't mean it's not

2273
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:05,679
worthwhile

2274
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:09,639
cool thanks for your comments

2275
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,679
anchor

2276
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:15,040
yeah um uh i i also so i think this is i

2277
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,719
guess we take this in order it's an

2278
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:18,080
interesting problem which was not a

2279
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,600
problem um

2280
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,679
uh um but like probably when we do have

2281
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:23,199
to attempt to attack in some way or at

2282
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:25,920
least like make a run at um by we i mean

2283
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,000
i have collectively um

2284
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,480
um i'm uh i i don't think the draft else

2285
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,320
was quite ready for adoption i think i

2286
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,440
could have better understand what the

2287
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:36,000
solution was like um i i think there's

2288
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,199
like enough questions that we can

2289
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:39,360
actually solve the problem but i have a

2290
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,560
solution that i was pretty confident up

2291
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,239
in hand um

2292
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:43,760
uh i'm agnostic on the question of

2293
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,080
whether it goes in add or in some

2294
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:49,360
other group um i would like that ads

2295
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,520
worry about that um you know this is

2296
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,880
excitation people float around a little

2297
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,400
bit um

2298
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,440
uh

2299
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:56,880
i agree with

2300
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,920
ben that um the the

2301
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,520
the non-existence case is less

2302
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,360
interesting than the um the multiple

2303
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,400
answers case

2304
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,960
um we we also fall back um that's like

2305
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,000
like the kind of solution people are

2306
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
gonna um i mean that that's the thing

2307
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,120
you're gonna have to do anyway i mean

2308
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,280
because this is the employment realities

2309
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,120
um this will not be universally deployed

2310
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:15,840
and therefore there'll be a lot of

2311
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,520
places with horizon where you'll have to

2312
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,360
fall back anyway and it's like really

2313
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,800
like doesn't it help you that much to

2314
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,320
have um um to have this this this is out

2315
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,960
there just for the lines in this case um

2316
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,280
and and finally i think um unusually

2317
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,600
off-brand for me um i think dns is the

2318
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:34,320
right answer for this uh uh uh um for

2319
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,920
this case um

2320
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,320
um and i would observe that um in fact

2321
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,320
if you have dns sec um you could

2322
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,320
probably substantially simplify this the

2323
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,560
structure um in the sense that um you

2324
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,760
don't need because you don't need to do

2325
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,280
this like query the police over things

2326
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,520
because like because you that then you

2327
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,360
could just stuff the dns about the

2328
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:54,719
delegation right into pvd um so um

2329
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:56,320
so i think you know

2330
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,120
um

2331
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:59,199
uh you know if people if people want to

2332
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:00,719
do something which like honestly that

2333
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:03,199
kind of stinks um like you know at least

2334
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:04,480
at least they can do is like yeah sex

2335
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:07,519
sign their speakage

2336
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:09,840
okay

2337
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,440
thanks

01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:14,880
um

2340
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,199
just commenting a few comments in the

2341
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:19,360
chat sort of saying that this news

2342
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,280
this should be done because it's a bad

2343
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:22,560
thing to do

2344
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:26,000
um which may or may not be true but uh

2345
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,920
on the other hand it's what people are

2346
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:28,800
doing

2347
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,480
um so given that we have to deal with

2348
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,159
the as is rather than what we'd like it

2349
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:34,560
to be then i think we absolutely need a

2350
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,719
solution for split horizon

2351
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:37,520
uh

2352
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,760
you know it's a common practice in

2353
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:42,560
enterprises and other use cases as the

2354
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,239
draft uh

2355
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:46,560
sort of details and therefore i i've

2356
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,280
failed to see why we shouldn't adopt it

2357
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:50,320
and that

2358
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,520
i think

2359
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,840
it's a problem we need to solve

2360
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,920
because it directly affects the use of

2361
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,520
encrypted dns

2362
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:00,080
which otherwise bypasses split horizon

2363
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:01,600
solutions

2364
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,840
um so i think we need to own the problem

2365
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,040
here

2366
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,360
rather than elsewhere but

2367
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,880
clearly other people think differently

2368
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,400
but there you are i think

2369
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,120
let's adopt it

2370
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:14,880
thank you

2371
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:17,520
vinny thanks

2372
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,080
yeah thanks um

2373
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:22,239
so tommy back to the comment you made

2374
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:24,639
earlier and i put this in chat uh the

2375
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:26,480
problem with nx domain in terms of

2376
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,560
enterprises is you're leaking enterprise

2377
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,280
private names to public dns servers and

2378
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:34,400
we've put a lot of work over the last 15

2379
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,880
years into vpn clients to actually block

2380
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:39,360
that behavior because customers have

2381
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,040
demanded that right they don't want

2382
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,719
their private

2383
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:46,000
dns names resolved by or attempted to be

2384
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,280
resolved by

2385
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,440
resolvers other than their own so i

2386
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,880
think

2387
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:54,239
you know that problem needs to be solved

2388
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:56,400
um

2389
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,960
in a way that and i think

2390
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:02,000
beyond just vpn in a way generically for

2391
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,480
for dns right additionally we've put a

2392
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,639
lot of effort into you know zero round

2393
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:09,600
trip time protocol improvements and

2394
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:10,480
nx

2395
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:11,600
domain

2396
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,840
processing you know adds latency for

2397
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,840
every request has to fail then try to

2398
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,440
get on a different interface now there

2399
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:18,840
is some

2400
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:21,920
parallel dns opportunistic dns

2401
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,000
resolutions but again those

2402
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,840
start sending dns

2403
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,400
enterprise dns names out over interfaces

2404
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,480
that the enterprise doesn't want them

2405
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,000
sent over

2406
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,800
so i think there's value in in

2407
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,120
this proposal it still needs some work

2408
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:39,360
to improve on that but i do think

2409
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,239
there's value here

2410
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,520
thank you vinnie uh eric

2411
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,679
are you wearing your a d hat or are you

2412
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:50,400
just eric

2413
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,560
and if you see this one discussing the

2414
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,719
chat not if okay but whatever

2415
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:59,840
so i hear a lot of interest in this

2416
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,840
draft

2417
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,000
also here there are some issues

2418
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,760
but you are talking about for a call for

2419
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,120
adoption so my only slight concern about

2420
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,880
the call for adoption is whether it

2421
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,199
should be done in admd

2422
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:14,960
or someplace else

2423
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:17,520
my understanding is really

2424
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,639
uh

2425
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:20,960
it fits a dd charger

2426
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:24,320
so for me that's good uh we may want to

2427
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:27,440
check with the chair with dns top and

2428
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,800
interior

2429
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,800
chairs as well

2430
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,800
whether there's a best fit outside but

2431
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,400
for me it fits led uh people are ill are

2432
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,639
aware of the problem so it should stay

2433
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:41,120
there but i will double check but again

2434
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,960
it's just for call for adoption so

2435
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,880
that's normal to have issues

2436
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,800
let's solve those issues before the

2437
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,520
group last call

2438
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,400
thank you eric and

2439
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,638
wes

2440
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,960
thanks so

2441
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:00,000
this space has a huge amount of history

2442
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
in it and um

2443
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,639
though you know it may seem like 80d is

2444
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:06,560
interesting first place to hit it it's

2445
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:07,840
it's actually quite old and i just sent

2446
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,679
a note to the mailing list

2447
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:12,000
that includes even a draft going back to

2448
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,040
2007 for how to deal with split dns

2449
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,280
within dns second how hard that is as

2450
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,480
well as rfc 8244 should definitely be

2451
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,000
read you know when considering this

2452
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,080
because it talks about all the issues

2453
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,000
with private namespaces and how much

2454
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,239
trouble that's caused and um

2455
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:30,000
you know between both

2456
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,120
both dns within the ietf including dns

2457
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,920
op and within icann this problem you

2458
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,880
know has a very ugly rearing head that

2459
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,960
is much much larger this than this group

2460
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,840
so i'd i'd tread cautiously because if

2461
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,239
uh if you think you're going to add a

2462
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:49,600
split dns just in the context of add or

2463
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,920
how to deal with it just here uh

2464
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,639
there'll be huge dragons there so

2465
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:57,840
it's a really hard problem

2466
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,920
you stole my comment wes i was gonna i

2467
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:01,440
was gonna say so you're in summary there

2468
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,360
are be dragons there

2469
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,320
yeah

2470
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:07,040
you beat me to it

2471
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:10,800
yeah that 2007 dns sec uh split horizon

2472
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,440
draft was was great i have not dug into

2473
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,440
the history of why it was abandoned uh

2474
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,440
but it describes four ways

2475
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,080
of deploying dns sec with horizon three

2476
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:22,080
of them would work with

2477
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:23,840
what what we have in mind one of them

2478
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,800
doesn't

2479
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,360
um and that would take on you know that

2480
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,280
would eliminate like several people

2481
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:30,960
suggested it would eliminate having to

2482
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:34,000
talk to the public dns to ask any

2483
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,760
questions instead you'd have all the

2484
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:37,520
answers in the dns

2485
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,679
signed records yourself

2486
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:41,520
so i can answer the abandonment issue

2487
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,520
because because that was written by my

2488
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,840
co-worker and

2489
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:46,880
the working group couldn't come to

2490
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:50,159
agreement that it was a good thing to do

2491
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:53,120
i i can feel that

2492
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:56,159
thanks

2493
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:57,760
okay um

2494
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:00,480
thank you dan um so

2495
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:03,120
please continue this discussion on list

2496
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,639
um as you can tell you know eric our ads

2497
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:08,239
paying attention the chairs are paying

2498
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:09,360
attention

2499
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:10,960
um and we're trying to really sort this

2500
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,080
through

2501
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,760
and i've heard some good suggestions

2502
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,840
here especially talking to the other

2503
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:19,120
uh potential groups uh and and so as the

2504
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:21,199
chair we'll do that um we'll go have

2505
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:22,560
that conversation

2506
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,320
um but please continue the discussion on

2507
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:25,840
this on this one

2508
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,679
all right and then we have the other

2509
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:31,440
document and let me bring that one up um

2510
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,120
uh

2511
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:36,400
and and we can talk about that

2512
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,239
next one um

2513
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:40,320
uh give me one second or can you bring

2514
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:41,679
up the

2515
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:44,080
hand

2516
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,880
let me try to bring the document up for

2517
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:49,040
you

2518
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,119
so this is the

2519
01:34:57,119 --> 01:34:59,040
uh deployment considerations document

2520
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:00,080
let me make sure i get the right one

2521
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:01,760
it's the five

2522
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:05,080
page one

2523
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,199
okay everyone can see

2524
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,360
okay this is old-fashioned you do it for

2525
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,560
me

2526
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,239
yeah i'll i'll do it for you so you let

2527
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:32,000
me know when you want to change the page

2528
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:32,960
okay

2529
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:35,119
all right change the page

2530
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:36,639
all right so i'm going to speak on

2531
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:38,719
behalf of my co-authors

2532
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:39,840
so um

2533
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,119
this is really

2534
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:42,480
uh

2535
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,320
the approach here is just very high

2536
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:47,199
level architectures to just to to

2537
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:48,639
capture like the

2538
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:50,639
deployment scenarios

2539
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:53,280
um that cover the ad protocols

2540
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,560
specifically

2541
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:57,199
really about in home networks when

2542
01:35:57,199 --> 01:35:59,040
you're deploying uh ad protocols and

2543
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,040
home networks it's not going into any

2544
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,639
kind of network specifics all of that

2545
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:04,400
it's really about the ad

2546
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,119
protocol that you need to do that

2547
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:09,600
we really use this

2548
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,000
when we were kind of figuring out how to

2549
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,080
do dnr we used it really to just

2550
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,679
describe all the different options for

2551
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:18,960
what dnr would do what what ddr would do

2552
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:19,920
and just kind of go through the

2553
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,760
different scenarios you go to the next

2554
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,080
slide

2555
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:26,480
um so this was actually part of the the

2556
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:29,520
dnr the dnr spec originally so we pulled

2557
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:30,480
it out

2558
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,480
um it wasn't really appropriate to be in

2559
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,639
the dnr spec but as i said we did use it

2560
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:36,480
as a as a really helpful guide for us to

2561
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,719
work out like what what all those

2562
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:40,480
scenarios would be what was appropriate

2563
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,320
to dnr kind of figure out all the

2564
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,080
different um

2565
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:45,600
possibilities

2566
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,760
and what was what would be specific to

2567
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:49,920
dnr which was ddr and kind of figure out

2568
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,360
all the edge cases

2569
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:52,960
um so we pulled it down to a different

2570
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:55,360
spec because it was clearly not

2571
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:57,119
appropriate to have it just in the in

2572
01:36:57,119 --> 01:36:58,880
the dnr spec

2573
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,560
and so that's what this is that's what

2574
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:01,920
this document is

2575
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:04,000
uh we found it really helpful when when

2576
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,840
we were creating dnr although it was not

2577
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:08,800
really specific to dnr

2578
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:11,199
yeah it hasn't changed since the last

2579
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:12,480
since the last

2580
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,560
itf meeting so there's nothing new in

2581
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:16,239
the document

2582
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:19,480
next slide

2583
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:26,400
um what it mainly focuses on is the

2584
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:27,840
target deployment so managed and

2585
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:30,239
unmanaged home router scenarios

2586
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:32,239
um and what do you do if you're hosting

2587
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:34,000
a forwarder in the in the local network

2588
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,480
so so uh

2589
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,480
when would you use dnr i wanted to use

2590
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,440
ddr um some some options when you might

2591
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:42,960
use acme these kind of things there's

2592
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,040
some nice network diagrams when would

2593
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,520
you use um

2594
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,639
what would it look like when you have a

2595
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:50,159
legacy router that can't be upgraded

2596
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:51,679
what would you do if you've got a legacy

2597
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:53,360
router you can upgrade all of that kind

2598
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:54,639
of stuff so

2599
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:57,440
i think the target is for people who so

2600
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,199
isps who might be looking at how they

2601
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:01,119
would what they would do to upgrade

2602
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:04,080
their their routers with with um

2603
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,400
uh with encrypted dns what they would

2604
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,800
put uh forwarders on proxies on them for

2605
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,600
example um how they would do that people

2606
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,600
who actually want to put forwarders and

2607
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:17,360
proxies on on on routers you know

2608
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,440
like for myself i work for i work for

2609
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:22,239
powerdns we have uh dns desk which is

2610
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:24,719
works on open wrt now for example those

2611
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:25,760
kind of things

2612
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:26,480
so

2613
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:29,360
um i think that's really the target but

2614
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,760
really next slide

2615
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,920
the question is is this appropriate for

2616
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:34,719
for

2617
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:37,199
or add is this is this something that we

2618
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:38,960
should have as a working group document

2619
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:41,440
i mean the best it's informational but

2620
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,440
um is this something we want to work on

2621
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,960
as a as a group i don't think it's

2622
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:46,320
actually requires a great deal of work

2623
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:50,960
as a group i i know uh eckers was saying

2624
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:52,480
this isn't you know this is something

2625
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:54,239
that would have priority as a working

2626
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:55,520
group document

2627
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:56,960
i don't think it would need a lot of

2628
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,280
priority as a group but uh i'd just be

2629
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,199
interested if folks want to

2630
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:03,199
want think it's it's useful for us to

2631
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:05,920
adopt as a group or not and i i think as

2632
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:07,920
as as an author and i think i'm speaking

2633
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:09,920
on behalf of my co-authors we we're not

2634
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:10,880
like

2635
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,520
super we're not going to stand here and

2636
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:15,280
like fight you know we're not going to

2637
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:18,960
die on on this particular hill but

2638
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,719
i said we found it useful when we were

2639
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:22,159
developing it so if people find it

2640
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:27,320
useful great if not then also fine

2641
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,840
so before i open the queue up for people

2642
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,000
to make comments um

2643
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,360
one thought

2644
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:34,719
uh

2645
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,880
the chairs have had uh in and talked

2646
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:39,040
with eric as well

2647
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:40,560
about this document

2648
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,040
you know add in our charter does have a

2649
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:45,600
sort of an informational document um

2650
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:48,159
listed as one of our deliverables

2651
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:50,480
and this document as it stands isn't

2652
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:54,480
that document but one thought is

2653
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:55,840
if we

2654
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,159
create that you know when we do create

2655
01:39:58,159 --> 01:40:01,199
that other document maybe this material

2656
01:40:01,199 --> 01:40:04,560
um is sort of like a a subset of that

2657
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,400
bigger informational document and and

2658
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,800
maybe one path would be to

2659
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:09,840
um

2660
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,679
you know start work on that

2661
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:13,199
informational document

2662
01:40:13,199 --> 01:40:15,679
take out of this document the relevant

2663
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:17,440
and useful pieces

2664
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:20,080
import it into that new draft

2665
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:22,320
um and that becomes sort of where this

2666
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,400
all ends up it doesn't end up in the dnr

2667
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:25,840
draft it doesn't end up in this draft

2668
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,920
potentially it ends up in that broader

2669
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,440
informational document which we do have

2670
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,040
in the charter so

2671
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:33,199
that's one thought that

2672
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:34,719
you know we were thinking obviously

2673
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:36,159
that's just you know from the chairs

2674
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:37,280
perspective

2675
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,639
uh it's you know

2676
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,480
it's up to the group and it's up to

2677
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:43,119
authors if they would want to maybe take

2678
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:44,639
that path as well

2679
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:46,480
to move forward but anyways let's open

2680
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,560
the queue up and have people comment

2681
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:51,360
andrew

2682
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:53,119
um so a

2683
01:40:53,119 --> 01:40:54,960
good reminder that it's actually uh

2684
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,040
something that we put in the charter

2685
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:58,000
so

2686
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,520
that's important

2687
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,199
also if i'm honest just reflecting on

2688
01:41:01,199 --> 01:41:03,840
the conversation that we've had

2689
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:06,400
over the last two papers in particular

2690
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:08,880
that to me underlines the the usefulness

2691
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:11,040
of actually documenting this

2692
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,880
um because there are clearly very

2693
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:14,639
different understandings of market

2694
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:16,239
requirements in different places so

2695
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:18,800
writing it down in an informational

2696
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,110
document um

2697
01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:21,600
[Music]

2698
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,440
and just using that as a helpful

2699
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:24,880
reference would seem to be to serve a

2700
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:27,440
very helpful purpose just so so we're

2701
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:29,440
all clear what use cases we're covering

2702
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,360
so i absolutely think this should be

2703
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:32,400
adopted

2704
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,800
uh as an informational document

2705
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:38,000
that we use thanks

2706
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,400
eric

2707
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:46,719
right so i think first like this is not

2708
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:48,320
as you say this is not even remotely the

2709
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,080
thing is in the charter the charter is

2710
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:52,159
an information mechanism for detect for

2711
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:53,760
describes mechanisms for clients to test

2712
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,520
specific network environments which is

2713
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,280
actually much more like the presentation

2714
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:00,800
we just saw prior to this um so um so

2715
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,480
perhaps we could like stuff some stuff

2716
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:03,840
from here into that into that document

2717
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:05,040
but like until someone starts that

2718
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,400
document that

2719
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:08,159
this is not like that

2720
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:09,119
um

2721
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:10,800
um i think there's some valuable

2722
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,280
material in this document um but i also

2723
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:14,320
think that there's a material i do not

2724
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:15,920
agree with and as far as i'd agree with

2725
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:17,360
and i do not want to spend the next two

2726
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:19,360
years of my life litigating every single

2727
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,040
piece of that um which is exactly what

2728
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:24,000
will happen if we if we if we take adopt

2729
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,119
this and treat this as something that we

2730
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:27,760
have we're going to pay attention to um

2731
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:28,400
so

2732
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:32,080
um the uh uh we have we have proposals

2733
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:34,320
um for two actual things and we should

2734
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:35,920
up or down on those proposals and on

2735
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,239
their own merits and this document is

2736
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:39,600
perfectly fine cities

2737
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:41,199
internet draft and people continue to

2738
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:42,320
update it and people can refer to as

2739
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:44,239
they please um and people can be

2740
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:45,679
informed by it but which does not need

2741
01:42:45,679 --> 01:42:48,239
to be any kind of work

2742
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:49,600
i i'm really interested that you say

2743
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,719
that there's this there's a bunch of

2744
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:52,320
stuff in here that you don't agree with

2745
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,639
uh because i i'm like astonished by that

2746
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:56,480
because i thought it was like completely

2747
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,400
uncontroversial because it mainly just

2748
01:42:58,400 --> 01:42:59,840
sort of sits there and lists a bunch of

2749
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,320
scenarios of how you can use uh add

2750
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,239
protocols so

2751
01:43:04,239 --> 01:43:05,520
and i haven't seen anything for you on

2752
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:07,119
the list about like

2753
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:10,320
your specific yeah i

2754
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:11,440
in a bunch of details book of my

2755
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,560
position where they shouldn't be adopted

2756
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:15,600
that i could not pay attention to it

2757
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:17,920
um i if if we adopt it i will give it a

2758
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,199
close read

2759
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:20,960
okay

2760
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:22,719
i'm sorry i'm sorry i would show you an

2761
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:23,920
example for you i remember reading and

2762
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,199
being kind of like yeah i don't agree

2763
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:27,600
with this but whatever so um

2764
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:29,040
so i certainly think one of the things

2765
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:31,280
that we that it could be done it's tony

2766
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:33,040
reads is a bit prescriptive sometimes

2767
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,960
which i think it certainly probably

2768
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,480
could do without it

2769
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:39,119
it shouldn't be prescriptive yeah

2770
01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:40,960
sure well again i'm sorry i don't work

2771
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,560
for example for you it's you know it's

2772
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,199
i've been up since 3 30.

2773
01:43:45,199 --> 01:43:46,159
okay

2774
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:48,159
thanks

2775
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:52,440
okay uh next one will be tommy

2776
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,320
right um

2777
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,119
yeah i mean largely i agree with what

2778
01:43:59,119 --> 01:44:01,679
hecker was saying i i think

2779
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:05,280
yeah i mean the content here isn't

2780
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:07,679
bad but it also doesn't feel like it's

2781
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:09,119
directly

2782
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:11,360
deeply tied into

2783
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:13,280
add and a lot of this may just be also

2784
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,280
the framing of how it

2785
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:17,280
reads um

2786
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:18,800
i i would strongly suggest you know

2787
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:21,920
since we have an informational document

2788
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:24,000
in the charter that needs to get done at

2789
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,040
some point

2790
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,280
and we have a bunch of authors who

2791
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:29,280
want to write the informational text to

2792
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:30,000
help

2793
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,679
people understand how to do deployments

2794
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:33,199
it seems like

2795
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:35,760
taking the suggestion to

2796
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,560
you know start working on that document

2797
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,560
figure out

2798
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:41,440
what

2799
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:42,400
of

2800
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,320
the stuff you have here make sense in

2801
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,400
there or as an appendix in that document

2802
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:47,360
would be

2803
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,520
a really good use

2804
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:51,840
of our time and effort um so that we

2805
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:54,400
don't end up

2806
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:58,560
getting into conversations on this and

2807
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,480
having arguments about it about how it

2808
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:01,440
should go

2809
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,280
and instead just say yeah we need an

2810
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:05,520
informational document anyway

2811
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,440
let's make progress on that we've

2812
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:10,480
already agreed to that in the charter

2813
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:13,360
right i mean i i mean i i personally i

2814
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:14,719
don't not speaking for my co-authors

2815
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:16,639
here but i personally see

2816
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:19,040
the idea of it being a part of a larger

2817
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:21,520
document perfectly reasonable i i don't

2818
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,040
quite get the point about it not being

2819
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:24,880
that relevant for add it pretty much

2820
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:28,400
exclusively covers uh add scenarios it

2821
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:30,159
certainly doesn't cover the whole of led

2822
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:32,639
it covers a specific topic about add

2823
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:34,239
which is deployment essentially you have

2824
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:35,760
add and home networks where you've got

2825
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:36,880
cpes

2826
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:39,440
so it's a kind of a narrow subset of add

2827
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:42,080
but it almost exclusively covers add it

2828
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:46,400
covers the uh discovery of of encrypted

2829
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:47,679
protocols in the situation where you've

2830
01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:49,600
got cps and home networks which is by

2831
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:51,440
the way and can i just remind everyone

2832
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:53,199
the most common way that people around

2833
01:45:53,199 --> 01:45:55,119
the world access the internet because i

2834
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:57,280
think that often gets lost here that is

2835
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:58,880
the most common way that people access

2836
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:00,880
the internet so everything we're talking

2837
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:03,040
about here if anyone thinks that that's

2838
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:05,360
those scenarios are not that are not

2839
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:07,760
relevant to add then then please you

2840
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:08,719
know

2841
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:10,639
tell me now because that

2842
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:12,480
i think they are the most relevant ways

2843
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:15,760
that people access the internet today so

2844
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:18,880
yeah i i guess what i would say

2845
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,239
to that is

2846
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:22,000
you know there's a lot of

2847
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
detail of diagrams here that

2848
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,880
before we even talk about how add works

2849
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:28,880
it explains yo here's how isps deploy

2850
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:31,199
their networks etc etc

2851
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:33,440
that feels like

2852
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:35,280
you know there could be some document in

2853
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:38,159
dns op that here's a catalog of

2854
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:40,080
different deployment types that

2855
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:42,480
something that addd did as informational

2856
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:45,760
could reference to say oh and here is

2857
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:48,159
the pretty simple way in which that gets

2858
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:49,280
expressed

2859
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:50,639
but

2860
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:52,080
a group that's talking about discovery

2861
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:54,480
specifically this is a catalog that

2862
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,400
seems to go

2863
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,880
beyond some of our expertise and should

2864
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:02,159
have a lot of input from generic dns ops

2865
01:47:02,159 --> 01:47:04,080
and operators

2866
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,320
sure i think i think the problem is that

2867
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:07,679
those things don't exist sometimes you

2868
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:09,119
just have to kind of roll your own

2869
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:10,560
because because you're trying to make

2870
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:11,600
something that makes sense as a

2871
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,040
standalone document and without

2872
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:14,800
something else to reference but i take

2873
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:17,119
the point

2874
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:22,520
okay thank you tommy um eric

2875
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:31,119
this draft is indeed relevant to admd

2876
01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:34,080
but it does not fit the charter as it is

2877
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:37,679
so it really cannot be adopted as it is

2878
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:40,159
with the the abstract and and and its

2879
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:41,679
content

2880
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:44,239
i can only suggest because the content

2881
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:46,960
seems interesting and useful to aid in

2882
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:50,480
with dns up or like already said include

2883
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:53,600
it into a la the larger informational

2884
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:56,400
document deliverable which is uh in the

2885
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:59,199
charter and the milestone of add but

2886
01:47:59,199 --> 01:48:00,800
like it is i'm afraid it cannot go

2887
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:03,199
forward adopt it cannot be adopted this

2888
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:04,880
issue can continue obviously as it's

2889
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:07,840
relevant to a dd

2890
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,239
thank you eric

2891
01:48:10,239 --> 01:48:11,440

2892
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:14,320
comments from the the the floor of the

2893
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:17,320

2894
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:21,440

and and we'll continue discussion on

2897
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:26,480
lists and and and among the chairs and

2898
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:27,840
we'll

2899
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,679
i guess the other two do there is uh for

2900
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:31,600
us to go have a conversation at least on

2901
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:33,119
the chairs to go have a conversation

2902
01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:34,080
with

2903
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:35,600
