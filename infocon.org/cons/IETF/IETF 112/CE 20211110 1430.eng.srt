23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,479
familiar with the usual not well

24
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,439
usual reminder about

25
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,640
the ipr rules within the atf

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,880
you should be aware of that when you

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,040
sign to

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,799
the medical tool when you

29
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,680
book the atf attendance i guess as well

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,200
so

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,720
if you aren't familiar with those please

32
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,520
have a look at the references here

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,680
remind that anything you

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,280
say share

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,479
or

36
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,119
follow discuss within the etf this may

37
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,680
maybe subject to some idf processes

38
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,159
related to the ipr rules so

39
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,920
please follow them

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,320
next

41
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,759
the guidelines are for conduct so

42
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,159
we know that since we don't meet face to

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,920
face sometimes

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,079
the

45
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,399
relationship between people may be a bit

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,680
different because we don't see each

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,360
other so

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,520
keep in mind that we are all

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,119
respectful young

50
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,560
beings

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,200
we're all expected to

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,480
respect our colleagues and

53
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,640
be kind with them we may have

54
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,720
disagreement at some point but we're

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,800
supposed to have in personal technical

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,760
discussions we are here to act as a

57
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,120
group to

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,640
build the

59
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,040
internet standards so

60
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,319
make sure that

61
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,400
you are following the respectful

62
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,840
otherwise your chairs may have to

63
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,440
act on

64
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,560
complex situations

65
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,760
next please

66
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:47,760
so

67
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,280
we are online

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,000
so as you may be aware of now

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,920
there are some

70
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,400
rules of conduct to

71
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,480
make it convenient for everyone when

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,120
connected on mythical

73
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,480
try to

74
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,480
mute yourself all the time

75
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,879
on unmute only or

76
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,200
when you need to present or

77
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,440
when you acknowledge on the queue to

78
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,159
raise a question or a comment

79
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,280
you may use your video knowing that

80
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,400
connection

81
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,720
for people may be different you weren't

82
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,120
necessarily supposed to if you feel it

83
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,440
may be complicated for your access link

84
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,760
headsets are recommended because

85
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,920
typically mics are much better when

86
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,798
close to the month

87
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,400

88
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,720

89
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,319

90
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,480
using it from time to time

91
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,760
uh some mythical information is

92
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,840

93
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,959
and you're still the the usual java chat

94
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,000

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,400

create new thread if

144
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,960
necessary you don't have to wait for a

145
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,479
slot

146
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,600
during the

147
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,560
meeting to start new work or progress

148
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,039
existing works

149
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,639
we have a wiki

150
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,960
which is full of very relevant

151
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,680
information if you feel there

152
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,120
are some missing ones either edit it or

153
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,400
send a

154
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,840
mail to the chairs and secretary

155
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,120
and don't forget to request uh

156
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,600
cutpoint early quarter location if you

157
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,199
feel that you have implementation at

158
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,680
stake that may require cut point before

159
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,520
the document is

160
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,319
published as an lc and has gone through

161
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,720
the inr there is a process for that and

162
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,280
we already have a couple of documents in

163
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,840
this case so keep in mind this is part

164
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,800
of

165
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,520
the

166
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,280
usual business to make sure that you

167
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,319
don't collide or squat cut points when

168
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,199
you implement a specification

169
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,840
next please

170
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,960
so the agenda we have here the agenda

171
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,039
for both sessions

172
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,280
if anyone has something to bash now is

173
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,280
the time especially for today's session

174
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,000
no one's in the queue so we'll move on

175
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,360
and i'll give the floor to draft for the

176
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,720
document

177
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,960
status for the pc working group

178
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,479
yeah thanks

179
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,400
julian so

180
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,199
a quick document status we have no new

181
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,080
rfcs since the last itf

182
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,319
we have a document in the rfc editor

183
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,319
queue in fact it's been there for a long

184
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,120
time

185
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,240
uh we did try to uh

186
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,319
unblock it so a version 13 was posted to

187
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,960
strip the blocking part which was the l2

188
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,560
vpn flow spec

189
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,800
from this id because that is now

190
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,440
dependent on the flow spec v2 work which

191
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,759
is ongoing in idr

192
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,120
and a separate id uh has been created

193
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,879
where we have moved the content related

194
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,440
to l2 vpn flow spec

195
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,120
into a separate id

196
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,000
so

197
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,360
one option that the authors asked was

198
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,599
can this be quickly adopted since the

199
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,960
content was

200
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,879
already in a document which had the

201
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,759
working group and in fact itf consensus

202
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,840
so can we do a quick working group

203
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,000
adoption call so this question is still

204
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,120
open if anybody has any comments and

205
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,520
thoughts please join the queue

206
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,919
otherwise i am sure julian will take an

207
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,399
action on it since i am a co-author

208
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,880
uh the next document that we have is the

209
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,599
binding sid this is the document with

210
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,880
with our ad

211
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
our ad gave comments and i think the

212
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,279
authors have updated it and handled the

213
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,040
comments so now it's just wait waiting

214
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,399
for ad to

215
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,839
uh go ahead uh john do you have any

216
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,839
comments on this otherwise i'll move on

217
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,760
i know i don't um acknowledge that i'm

218
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,600
that you're waiting on me so

219
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,000
i will get to those soon thank you

220
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,240
thank you john

221
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,959
so next we had an erata uh this was uh

222
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,959
an errata based on

223
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,839
uh

224
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,000
the rbnf ordering

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,080
with respect to lsp object and class

226
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,880
type object in pc request

227
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,680
this was rejected and john gave his

228
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,760
reasoning clearly on the mailing list

229
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,440
and there was some free

230
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,240
some corresponding discussion as well on

231
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,480
the thread on how we can resolve such a

232
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,600
problem there is a new id proposed on it

233
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,440
and it's on the agenda on the friday

234
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,160
session where we can discuss this

235
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,000
in more detail

236
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,959
we have three documents which had asked

237
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,040
for early ina code point and all of

238
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
these are allocated please note the

239
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,399
expiry date

240
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,200
uh

241
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,920
so

242
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,600
the expectation is that if there is a

243
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,279
second uh

244
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,760
call needs to be made for extending just

245
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,519
keep this in mind ideally we would like

246
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,000
to if the document is ready within that

247
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,600
timeline that would be much better

248
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,760
otherwise we would need to request an

249
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,319
extension

250
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,079
so next i will quickly go over some of

251
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,079
the working group documents especially

252
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,240
the documents where we want to check the

253
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,800
status from the authors

254
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,399
these are the documents which are

255
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,800
nearing working group last call which is

256
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,760
stateful gmpls i think authors have done

257
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,079
their job and it is they have confirmed

258
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,480
that it is ready for working with lascal

259
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,560
and i think the chairs will take an

260
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,600
action on it next pretty soon

261
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,839
uh with the second document so i request

262
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,360
authors if they disagree with what i'm

263
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,040
saying and if they have further comments

264
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,160
please

265
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,920
join the queue and i will give you the

266
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,839
floor

267
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,839
the second document is the enhanced

268
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,680
error we discussed this in the last

269
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,959
meeting as well

270
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,519
and chairs have not made a decision on

271
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,560
what to do next with it uh just to recap

272
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,600
when we

273
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,839
polled for interest on this document we

274
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,240
did not get much interest

275
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,600
shown on the list

276
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,839
uh some of the options that we were

277
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,519
thinking that maybe we can make it

278
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,440
experimental but even if we do that we

279
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,600
would still need more people to review

280
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,480
and send comments and confirm that they

281
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,720
feel like the document is ready for

282
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,200
publication as an experimental document

283
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,440
another option was that we mark it in

284
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
our data tracker as waiting for

285
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,240
implementation and let's see if

286
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,440
one of the

287
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,240
work like maybe stateful inter domain or

288
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,120
some other work take up uh this enhanced

289
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,760
error mechanism and start using it and

290
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,360
implementing it and at that time it

291
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,040
would be a good idea to

292
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,839
uh

293
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,399
maybe publish the two work together so

294
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,399
we are still uh

295
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,720
waiting for uh like you know decision on

296
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,279
this if anybody has any thoughts please

297
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,920
reach uh reach out to chairs at any time

298
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
and after this itf most probably we will

299
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,839
be making a decision on this pretty soon

300
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,000
next we have psep yank

301
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
uh this an update was posted uh uh

302
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,720
on this last month

303
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,399
the comments were there from tom patch

304
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,399
and thanks for him for doing a good

305
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,320
review and always providing comments

306
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,920
with each update

307
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,839
uh the yang doctor review on this

308
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,120
document is pretty old so i think one is

309
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,079
we can

310
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,160
look for a young doctor review and even

311
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,720
working group last call next the thing

312
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,240
to note on the right hand side is the

313
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,519
dependencies

314
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,760
so it is dependent on some documents

315
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,880
like itf tls client and itf tls solver

316
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,120
both of them in working group last call

317
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,560
in netconf

318
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,920
itfte in teas is also in the queue for

319
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,079
working group last call so i think

320
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,399
uh psepjank can move and all our

321
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,639
dependencies are kinda handled and this

322
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,320
document could also be

323
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,040
uh moved to working up last call and

324
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,040
yang doctor review etc pretty soon

325
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,360
uh i wanted to highlight about native ip

326
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,800
uh we posted it on the idr list

327
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,320
that we are looking for feedback since

328
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,240
this is related to bgp

329
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,839
uh session establishment via psep uh we

330
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,000
have also authors have asked for agenda

331
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,399
time in the idr so in tomorrow's session

332
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,560
on thursday they will be discussing and

333
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,600
we hope to get some early feedback uh

334
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,320
from the idea on this and whenever we do

335
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,680
the working group class call on this

336
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,160
document i will make sure that we cross

337
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,240
post it in the both working group so

338
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,399
that there are not no late surprises

339
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,680
when it moves out of the working group

340
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,839
with flex grid there hasn't been a

341
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,240
change for a pretty long time uh but

342
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,440
authors

343
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,880
want to give a chance do you think the

344
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,480
document is ready is there any open

345
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,160
issues with it

346
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,600
if they have any information that they

347
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,760
won't pass on this is a good time to do

348
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,920
that

349
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,160
otherwise i'll move on but the wiki is

350
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,320
there you can always update and keep the

351
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,519
working group

352
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,560
in loop

353
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,839
with your working group document status

354
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,880
these two

355
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,000
documents

356
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,079
are sr the document related to srv6

357
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,800
again this has been pretty stable

358
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,639
in my reading this might be nearing

359
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,959
working group last call status

360
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,880
if authors have any update on this

361
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,680
please let us know

362
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,839
i don't see anyone coming in

363
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,000
i will

364
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,480
wait for a second no uh the next one we

365
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,040
have vn association in this authors have

366
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,959
confirmed that this is ready so we will

367
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,359
take an action on it uh accordingly

368
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,480
the two sr path segment an sr

369
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,839
bi-directional

370
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,160
document these have have been updated

371
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,000
but not too much of technical changes

372
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,519
mainly sync up with published documents

373
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,760
i don't see any open issues

374
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,000
on these documents so hopefully these

375
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,760
documents are also nearing working group

376
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,959
last calls

377
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,480
if any of the authors want to say

378
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,199
something please

379
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,720
go ahead otherwise this is the status as

380
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,680
for working group

381
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,199
that this document the uh the candidate

382
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,040
path sr policy document it's on the

383
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,800
agenda so

384
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,480
uh we will discuss this next anyways

385
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,240
with respect to local protection

386
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,079
enforcement there was an update no

387
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,519
significant change there is an ina

388
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,600
allocation for this and i think if the

389
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,839
document is ready and there is nothing

390
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,160
pending i think i request authors to

391
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,440
prepare and

392
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,360
uh ask for working group last call

393
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,240
accordingly andrew go ahead

394
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,759
yeah this is andrew um yeah i just

395
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,880
wanted to acknowledge that it's

396
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,320
basically just been kind of sitting in a

397
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,519
steady state

398
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,279
um so if anybody has any concerns or

399
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,040
comments definitely i'm all ears

400
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,199
otherwise i mean it's it's there it's

401
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,240
pretty straightforward there's two

402
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,000
implementations

403
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,279
so whenever the working group feels that

404
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,120
it's ready i'm good to proceed further

405
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,800
with it thanks

406
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,519
thanks andrew

407
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,120
uh we have a pcc sr

408
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,040
there was an update

409
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,959
and they have done the alignment with

410
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,959
the published rfc

411
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,519
1950 so thanks for that

412
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,160
uh for stateful interdomain we did not

413
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,360
have an update this time uh

414
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,160
for extended flags

415
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
a new version has been posted and the

416
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,600
comments that were received during the

417
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,360
adoption call are handled so thank you

418
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,880
for that again

419
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,560
let's keep our documents up to date and

420
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,839
handle comments as and when we get them

421
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,639
multipath is on the agenda the state

422
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,480
sync

423
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,639
was updated and again the comments that

424
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,160
were received during the adoption call

425
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,519
were handled so thanks authors for that

426
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,320
and

427
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,759
finally this is our recent adopted

428
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,240
working group document on optional

429
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,639
objects the authors have posted an

430
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,560
update and have handled comments during

431
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,320
the working group adoption so thanks

432
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,160
again for that

433
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,320
and finally this is our working group

434
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,480
adoption poll queue there is an ongoing

435
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,000
call for srp to mp policy

436
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,760
and our plan is uh to do a reshuffling

437
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,640
of our queue so after it of 112 we will

438
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,520
reshuffle our adoption queue based on

439
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,280
the feedback that we get so if you have

440
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,799
any comments please reach out to our

441
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,839
chairs

442
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,079
uh during this time and we will be

443
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,559
publishing the updated poll queue on our

444
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,760
wiki

445
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,120
that's it if anybody has any comments

446
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,640
on the working group documents please

447
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,160
use this time otherwise we'll move to

448
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,360
the main agenda

449
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,880
saying no one

450
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,520
off to you mike

451
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,679
thanks um hi everybody i'm michael i'm

452
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,600
from cisco systems

453
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,000
presenting uh piece of extensions for

454
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,480
signaling multi-path information

455
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,640
on behalf of my co-authors next page

456
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,440
please

457
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,760
so just to give a quick review of uh

458
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,919
what this draft is you know high level

459
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,200
about

460
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,039
is that if you have the pc compute

461
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,840
compute something that it allows you to

462
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,600
return multiple paths for that

463
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,919
computation

464
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:18,720
so

465
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,880
basically

466
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,799
and we keep this independent of any data

467
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,039
plane

468
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,520
or application such as sr policy rcpte

469
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,760
and we also

470
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,679
make the extensions applicable to

471
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,919
stateful and stateless psab

472
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,400
so it works just as well with pc request

473
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,480
and pc reply

474
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,880
so for example if you want like to send

475
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,919
just a pc request with

476
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,520
requesting

477
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,240
a path you can use all these extensions

478
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,440
uh

479
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,960
just as well next slide please

480
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,440
so

481
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,520
um basically

482
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,080
without this draft

483
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,400
pc can only return either zero or one

484
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,720
forward pass

485
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,480
in response to a computation request

486
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,520
so this was sufficient for rcpt tunnels

487
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,679
because they always follow

488
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,880
like each hop is one link

489
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,039
then with sr policy

490
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,160
we required

491
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,880
that there could be multiple

492
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,480
forward paths

493
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,400
for a certain

494
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,039
candidate path

495
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,600
uh and so as our policy has this concept

496
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,760
of segment lists under each candidate

497
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,960
path

498
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,200
and so the traffic towards each

499
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,760
candidate path is spread out

500
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,559
among the different segment lists

501
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,480
and so this draft was originally

502
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,080
motivated by this application of

503
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
multiple segment lists

504
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,760
but again as i said we keep it

505
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,320
completely agnostic of any application

506
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,600
so

507
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,039
it's not

508
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,280
limited to sr policy

509
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,280
and then with the latest uh set of

510
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,440
updates to this draft

511
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,559
we allow not only uh four multiple

512
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,559
forward paths but we allow multiple

513
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,520
reverse paths to be returned

514
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,559
and

515
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,760
there's a kind of a detailed mapping

516
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,400
from each forward path

517
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,840
to a set of reverse paths

518
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,760
and from each reverse path to a set of

519
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,159
forward paths

520
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,320
that i will examine in the next few

521
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,918
slides next slide please

522
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,760
so we just defined this

523
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,039
tlv

524
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,200
called opposite direction path tlv

525
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,720
and this uh tov goes into the path

526
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,120
attributes object

527
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,760
and it specifies the

528
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,360
uh

529
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,600
one of the reverse paths or one of the

530
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,640
opposite direction paths to the to the

531
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,280
path that

532
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,240
to the path of the like the current path

533
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,559
attribute object

534
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,640
so

535
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,120
basically there could be multiple copies

536
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,919
of or multiple instances of this tlv in

537
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,200
each

538
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,679
path attributes object

539
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,280
because there could be multiple reverse

540
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,480
paths

541
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,200
for a given forward path

542
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,480
and it's also

543
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,240
not necessarily true that if path one is

544
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,720
the opposite of path two

545
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,880
it is not necessarily true that path two

546
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,280
is the opposite of path one so basically

547
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,120
this opposite

548
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,760
oppositeness property is not mutual and

549
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,480
i'll give an example of that later

550
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,360
next slide please

551
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,000
so here we'll go through an example of

552
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,360
circuit style as our policies

553
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,320
so

554
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,640
circuit style as our policies are

555
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,990
basically

556
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,200
[Music]

557
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,960
basically kind of

558
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,120
two policies from

559
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,799
opposite head ends or opposite routers

560
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,159
and

561
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,679
the

562
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,520
the paths of these policies are very

563
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,280
tightly coupled so

564
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,840
each router

565
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,159
uh when it sends traffic in the forward

566
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,679
direction it knows that the reverse

567
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,760
traffic will come back in on the same

568
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,960
set of links

569
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,000
in the reverse direction

570
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,600
and basically

571
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,000
what we want to do is we want

572
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,039
each each of the routers so for example

573
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,000
in this in this uh picture here there is

574
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,400
h1 and e1 which are like the pe routers

575
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,440
that have uh sr policies

576
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,120
so there's basically an sr policy going

577
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,320
from h1 to e1 and the reverse sr policy

578
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,799
going from e1 to h1

579
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,880
so we can see that in the data model

580
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,840
section

581
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,840
here

582
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,600
each answer policy has two candidate

583
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,120
paths

584
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,520
and each candidate path has two segment

585
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,039
lists

586
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,200
so if we look at the blue segment list

587
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,400
for example on the left

588
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,640
on router h1

589
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,400
this segment list

590
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,080
goes h1 m1 m2 e2

591
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,400
and there's a corresponding reverse

592
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,520
segment list blue on the right on router

593
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,039
e1

594
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,960
that is just the reverse of that segment

595
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,200
list so it will be

596
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,159
it starts at e1 then goes to m2 then m1

597
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,760
and h1

598
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,240
so these two segment lists are you know

599
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,159
they would be for example like adjacency

600
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,559
labels that are just

601
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,039
reversed

602
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:54,480
and

603
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,240
the goal is that each each of the

604
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,520
policyhead ends must know

605
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,760
the forward path

606
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,080
obviously but also you must know the

607
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,080
reverse path that corresponds to the to

608
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,240
each forward path

609
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,480
and so we see that in the psap signaling

610
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,640
session section i basically

611
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,279
is

612
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,240
if you look at for example the blue ero

613
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,559
if you just use that as an as a

614
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,640
as a guide you'll see that the path

615
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,720
attributes

616
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,240
uh of that blue arrow have path id 1 and

617
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,880
opposite path id 3

618
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,120
and then if you look at the second

619
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,200
instance on the left of the blue ero

620
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,720
you'll see that it has path id 3

621
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,880
and opposite path id 1. so it means that

622
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,559
basically the second instance of the

623
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,240
blue arrow is

624
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,039
is actually a reverse arrow

625
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,880
and it has this r flag set to one

626
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
which means that it's basically not to

627
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,480
be installed into forwarding but it's

628
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,840
just for informational purposes

629
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,320
and so the same the same thing repeats

630
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,200
for the for the yellow ero

631
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,840
so it's quite a bit of information um to

632
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,880
kind of

633
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,640
to analyze but if you if you just follow

634
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,720
the colors i think it it kind of makes

635
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,240
sense

636
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,400
uh and for example there's like a purple

637
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,520
ero in the second candidate path

638
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,039
that does not have a reverse

639
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,799
and basically that's also encoded with

640
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,279
because it has the opposite path id of

641
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,520
zero

642
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,760
all right um chang has a question i'm

643
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,039
not sure if i should answer it

644
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:39,840
if

645
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,039
i can answer it now if you want like

646
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,559
tony from holly

647
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,400
then i i didn't have time to read the

648
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,039
detail of your draft and it's right but

649
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,760
i have a simple simple question

650
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,279
like uh

651
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,919
i guess that you you know you know that

652
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,840
we have a draft of

653
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,640
bi-directional uh as a pause and we are

654
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,760
using the part segment to associate the

655
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,320
uh forward direction and the reverse

656
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,440
direction pause into like how say

657
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,279
about it by directional pause

658
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,240
and we can make the uh the both

659
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,679
direction pause

660
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:16,559
as

661
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,440
uh

662
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,080
like offside up outside

663
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,240
uh uh uh i'll say reverse uh all the c

664
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,960
list like what you mentioned here so i

665
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,640
would like to know that what's the

666
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,799
difference between that solution and

667
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,960
this solution

668
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,559
right yes that's a very good question

669
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,600
yeah that's a very good question so

670
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,200
basically the the difference is that

671
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
this solution lets you

672
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,159
uh support multiple segment lists

673
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,120
so

674
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,360
it still uses these this bi-directional

675
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
association if you look at the data

676
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,840
model here

677
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,559
there's like some noise change

678
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,120
it still sends

679
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,360
the bi-directional association a1 for

680
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,120
candidate path one

681
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,000
on h1 and

682
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,240
and the same bi-directional association

683
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,919
a1

684
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,039
on candid path 1 on e1

685
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,640
so that the two candidate paths are

686
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,159
associated

687
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,480
but it's also necessary to

688
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,039
to link the each segment list together

689
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,520
with with another segment list or with a

690
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,840
set of other segment lists

691
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,640
so

692
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,480
that association works at the level of

693
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,320
the candidate path

694
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,399
but if you have a candidate path with uh

695
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,799
multiple segment lists then it doesn't

696
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,520
uh seem to work that well or

697
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,120
it doesn't uh

698
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,600
fully cover everything

699
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,440
but we can take that discussion offline

700
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,200
as well

701
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,000
next uh slide please

702
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,520
we can

703
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
discard this further yep

704
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,760
yeah

705
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,440
so here i'll just give an example of

706
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,960
um

707
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,640
of of uh

708
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,120
of a path that has a forward path uh

709
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,679
with two reverse paths but

710
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,120
uh the

711
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,679
reverse paths or yeah the reverse path

712
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,679
are not

713
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:14,720
um

714
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,559
so like the relationship is not mutual

715
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,200
so basically like

716
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,919
path uh two and three are

717
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,320
the our opposite direction to path one

718
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,360
but path one is not opposite direction

719
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,240
to

720
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,399
path two and three

721
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,880
so if we look at this example there is a

722
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,760
head end on

723
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,360
on the left

724
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,440
and if you look at how the

725
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,159
sr traffic with node 04 would be sent it

726
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,840
would be sent

727
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,720
on the green links

728
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,919
and the pc may give you

729
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,720
the reverse paths a set of adjacency

730
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,399
lists

731
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,520
for example

732
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,880
adjacency segment going from four

733
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,600
to

734
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,000
towards two and then towards one

735
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,600
and then another adjacent

736
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,120
label start going from four towards

737
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,919
three towards one

738
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:08,880
and

739
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,600
um so this is encoded as i've shown

740
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,799
below and basically

741
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,760
what's important is that it's not

742
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,159
true that basically the green path is

743
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,880
the reverse of the yellow path for

744
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,840
example or the reverse of the blue path

745
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,120
but the

746
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,279
yellow and the blue taken together are

747
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,600
the reverse of the green so basically

748
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,080
this encoding just allows you to

749
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,720
have a very flexible

750
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,520
uh

751
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,880
way to

752
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,279
to encode like relationship between

753
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,399
paths

754
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,480
if you want to for example send oem

755
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,039
packets that loop uh you know that have

756
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,480
a double stack

757
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
of mpls labels like forward and reverse

758
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,840
stack

759
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,080
uh you know you could you could uh use

760
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,679
this much uh much uh much more

761
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,440
efficiently right because you could you

762
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,240
could choose exactly which

763
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,880
reverse path it's gonna take uh you know

764
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,399
the head end can choose exactly which

765
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,440
reverse path is going to take

766
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,240
next slide please

767
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,399
so yeah just requesting some feedback

768
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,010
from the working group on this

769
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,440
[Music]

770
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,520
recent set of

771
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,159
additions for the reverse path

772
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,200
and

773
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,039
we need to request a code point

774
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,120
allocation

775
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,479
so that we can start implementing

776
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,279
uh bike uh

777
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,600
uh mike one uh comment that i would have

778
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,480
with my chair hat on would be uh this is

779
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,440
a pretty big change so do discuss this

780
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,919
on the working group list like what is

781
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,840
the requirement for this change get

782
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,279
working groups

783
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,120
feedback on this i think it's okay to

784
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,720
update a working group document and ask

785
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,520
for

786
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,200
slot but like keep the mailing list

787
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
engaged as well so bring up this change

788
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,679
on the mailing list specifically and ask

789
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,240
for feedback of the working group

790
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,559
right thanks i'll do that

791
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,120
and second i think adding to what cheng

792
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,519
was saying uh i think we need to have a

793
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,039
section which clearly describe the

794
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,240
relationship with sr bi-directional and

795
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,600
have a clarity on how that extension

796
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,519
gets used in which cases and in case

797
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,120
there is a multi-path

798
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,799
how the two things will work with each

799
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,080
other and of course you can imagine

800
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,760
there could be error cases and others

801
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,279
where you

802
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,240
put some information in association and

803
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,760
a little bit different information in

804
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,679
your tlv so how all that thing will work

805
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,519
together so a little bit more tightening

806
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,840
is needed and i see i think some authors

807
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,919
of sr bi-directional is also there so

808
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,519
i'm hoping that they will keep track of

809
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,120
this work as well

810
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,840
so boris uh go ahead with your question

811
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,760
a very short comment mike will be very

812
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,960
helpful if implementation status

813
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,880
will be added

814
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,440
to the next version

815
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,080
yeah we don't currently uh have uh

816
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,159
an implementation uh status um but uh

817
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,640
we will add it as soon as possible and

818
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
that's why iona code points would also

819
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,840
be very useful

820
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,840
rakish

821
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,919
everyone this is

822
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,120
from cisco

823
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,360
uh so just to add

824
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,480
to the previous comments uh in the sr

825
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,640
bi-directional draft

826
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,519
we have added a new section that talks

827
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,159
about the relationship with this drop

828
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,080
that mike is presenting

829
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,799
as well as i think there is a

830
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,880
explanation in the draft that mike is

831
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,360
presenting uh with some examples that

832
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,519
also points back to the bi-directional

833
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,919
uh how it could work so they both have

834
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,279
some

835
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,919
i guess sections uh about

836
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,120
so please uh review the the text then

837
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,600
let us know the feedback

838
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,320
thanks sakish

839
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,240
when it's finished i just want to get a

840
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,360
feedback

841
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,039
from the working group and let's discuss

842
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,039
further here

843
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,320
thanks mike there was also a a point

844
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,000
that

845
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,240
that kaithin brought up in idr working

846
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,399
group just before this where he was

847
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,720
mentioning that some of these changes uh

848
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,960
needs to be discussed in spring as well

849
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,880
and he brought up the issue actually

850
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,000
related to

851
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,399
a backup segment list and where he was

852
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,000
saying that that's not a part of the sr

853
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,600
policy architecture

854
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,080
and uh it's something that is missing so

855
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,760
we need to keep the track of that as

856
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,279
well i wanted to make sure that it's

857
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,120
captured in our minutes so that we can

858
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,240
track it

859
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
um yeah that's a good point i'll sync up

860
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,840
with kate and

861
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,399
yeah

862
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,959
uh lua

863
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,720
so i haven't

864
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,320
really carefully

865
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,919
read shanks draft and mike staff

866
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,360
together

867
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,679
but it seems like

868
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,919
there is an opportunity to to merge

869
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,679
draws here

870
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,480
uh

871
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,520
would that

872
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,639
fly with the authors

873
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,560
um like the sr bodier draft is more like

874
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
associating you know

875
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,159
different candidate paths um

876
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,879
but this draft is is working within each

877
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,800
candidate path to further kind of

878
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,560
associate

879
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,599
uh

880
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,119
you know segment lists i think that is

881
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,520
fine if that's the case i think you

882
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,520
should actually

883
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,800
get some some text about that

884
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,399
in your draft

885
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,119
and they right yeah

886
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,719
some in their draft

887
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,560
yeah point taken yeah i think that

888
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,719
that's kind of missing yeah some linkage

889
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,199
between them

890
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,480
uh rakish quickly

891
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,079
see uh the need to merge them they are

892
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,560
quite different uh use cases so they

893
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,640
solve different problems uh there is

894
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,119
text for that in the binder draft please

895
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,480
review and let us know you think that

896
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,480
thanks

897
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,359
yeah and also uh just a like a one five

898
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,000
second uh comment like i keep this or we

899
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,839
keep this this multipath draft as

900
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,359
completely uh agnostic to any sr

901
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,760
uh technology right so basically it's uh

902
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,400
it's kind of a generic psap extension

903
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,640
that can be applied to you know other

904
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,279
data planes

905
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,920
okay mike let's move on to the next

906
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,440
presentation which is also by you

907
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,000
yep hi again so i'm mike from cisco i'll

908
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,160
be presenting psep extensions to support

909
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,040
segment routing policy candidate paths

910
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,280
on behalf of my co-authors next slide

911
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,280
please

912
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,320
um so

913
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,800
there were some or there are some like

914
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,040
uh generic kind of tunnel mechanisms

915
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,119
that were standardized as part of sr

916
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,920
policy architecture draft

917
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,960
uh these include uh computation priority

918
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,160
explicit null label policy drop upon

919
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,280
valid and specified bc only

920
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,880
uh the first two are kind of not

921
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,800
really implemented that much but we

922
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,599
still you know need to standardize them

923
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,440
and piece up

924
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,119
and

925
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,880
we want to

926
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,359
make these

927
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,240
these mechanisms generic so that they're

928
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,359
applicable for rcpt tunnels

929
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,800
or any other kind of tunnels in the

930
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
future

931
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,320
because that's what they really are they

932
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,599
are generic

933
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,400
next slide please

934
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,880
so the for the drop upon invalid we

935
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
propose this tlv

936
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,200
called invalidation tlv and basically

937
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,960
just has

938
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,560
it lets

939
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,119
the pce to to to

940
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,400
tell the pcc uh what to do if the

941
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
if the path becomes invalid

942
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,520
so there's basically two options either

943
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,079
redirect the traffic towards

944
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,720
igp which is the default

945
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,760
or

946
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,000
drop the traffic when the osp becomes

947
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,160
invalid

948
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,280
and

949
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,359
it the steel also has a state field

950
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,560
which

951
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,119
kind of has similar feel a similar value

952
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,480
of zero

953
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,960
if it's not dropping and one if it is

954
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,040
dropping traffic

955
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,079
uh so just a simple tlv to encode that

956
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,880
next slide please

957
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,359
and there's another functionality that's

958
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,480
uh

959
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,560
that was from the sr policy draft

960
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,480
where basically uh

961
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,560
we don't want to bring up the lsp

962
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,599
if the bcd is not available for

963
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,160
programming

964
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,079
and so to cover this we request a bit in

965
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,680
the path by t path binding tlv

966
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,760
um and uh

967
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,440
this bid will be per tlv or per bc um

968
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,640
and

969
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,560
so if you have like multiple bcds for

970
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,599
the same

971
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,960
uh lsp they can have different uh values

972
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,720
of these bits so you can see that some b

973
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,800
saids are like mandatory

974
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,800
and some bits or some b seeds are not

975
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,119
mandatory

976
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,680
so again just a simple extension uh next

977
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,240
slide please

978
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,160
and i got this question

979
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,770
from

980
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,800
[Music]

981
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,000
privately

982
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,720
and basically um

983
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,800
there's this current rules is that this

984
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,760
sr policy candidate path id tlv

985
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,920
is mandatory in the pc initiate message

986
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,310
um

987
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,760
[Music]

988
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,680
but it if you think about it really

989
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,400
doesn't have to be mandatory uh pc could

990
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,720
emit it and pcc could

991
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
uh you know just choose the values for

992
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,040
it because it owns

993
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,240
uh kind of

994
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,359
owns the policy if you will

995
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,119
so uh we could make this tlv be optional

996
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,160
uh in the pc init message so if the pc

997
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,240
does not know like all the values it can

998
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,960
just emit the tlv or yeah i made the tlv

999
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,560
and basically the pcc will

1000
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,800
fill whatever values

1001
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,400
it chooses

1002
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,200
next slide please

1003
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,640
so there is a implementation status

1004
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,440
of

1005
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,400
cisco and juniper we both have proof of

1006
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,599
concepts with ayana code points

1007
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,560
we had successful interrupt testing

1008
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,720
with uh between cisco

1009
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,920
and juniper

1010
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,040
at the entc event

1011
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,119
next step would be

1012
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,840
to get feedback on the new

1013
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,160
[Music]

1014
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,240
new tlvs

1015
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,960
and we want to request iona code points

1016
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,359
for the additional tles

1017
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,078
that's all thanks

1018
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,839
hi boris gale

1019
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,160
hi mike again

1020
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,440
one question and suggestions also

1021
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,760
so question if we

1022
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,000
will have a look to

1023
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,599
7.4 item in the draft pc initiated this

1024
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,319
our policy with multiple uh candidate

1025
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,440
perhaps

1026
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,200
item one is

1027
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,359
sounds quite quite confusing because

1028
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,920
there is no clear differentiation uh

1029
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,920
like should be uh

1030
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,119
should pc send one pce initiate message

1031
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,640
or multiple

1032
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,920
maybe

1033
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,480
would be worth to add like more clearly

1034
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,520
like

1035
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,160
may send or shoot sand or whatever

1036
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,920
uh yeah so

1037
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,960
uh i believe there's each pc initiate

1038
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,800
message could contain multiple like lsps

1039
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,960
or it could or they could arrive in

1040
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,280
different pc initiate messages

1041
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,040
i think that you know the unit of

1042
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,240
signaling in psap is is this p p osp

1043
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,560
right uh posd id

1044
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,200
so you could have multiple plsp ids in

1045
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,359
the same message

1046
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,520
uh or but that doesn't really give you

1047
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,920
anything except for save like four bytes

1048
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,480
of message header

1049
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,880
or you could send multiple

1050
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,720
pc init messages

1051
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,000
with

1052
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,240
each message containing only one plsp id

1053
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,200
yep okay and a second comment uh

1054
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,720
regarding um implementation status we

1055
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,440
recently did some uh testing with our

1056
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,400
own controller prototype and

1057
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,280
actually both uh you and uh i mean

1058
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,880
sister and juniper

1059
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,440
you currently support it in production

1060
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,520
version of software

1061
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,520
yeah so it's not proof of concept

1062
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,520
anymore

1063
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,440
uh yeah that's correct it's not a proof

1064
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,319
of concept uh

1065
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,640
right uh yeah maybe we should just say

1066
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,400
that then yeah

1067
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,520
okay i i have a few more questions but i

1068
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,599
will send on the list

1069
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,760
thank you

1070
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,720
actually

1071
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,240
like we use this vendor tlv um because

1072
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,160
right now there is not no

1073
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,920
yeah so that's that's what i mean that's

1074
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,160
what i mean by proof of concept it's not

1075
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,599
uh one comment that i wanted to bring

1076
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,599
like get the working group feedback on

1077
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,400
the generic mechanism uh so right now

1078
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,720
all these mechanisms uh to make it

1079
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,079
generic they are not part of the

1080
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,839
association object they are carried

1081
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:56,960
outside it

1082
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,760
but the main use cases for these is

1083
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,960
still

1084
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,920
sr policy so now the issue comes in that

1085
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,000
the name of the document is sr policy

1086
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,599
and we are keeping some generic

1087
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,800
mechanism so it's okay to do it it's

1088
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,800
there's not a hard and fast rule but we

1089
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,079
want to make sure that we are doing the

1090
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,680
right thing and the working group is

1091
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,400
thinking about it uh one option could be

1092
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,960
that we kind of highlight that though uh

1093
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,560
like you know this is still sr policy

1094
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,720
the main use cases are coming from the

1095
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,599
sr policy architecture the encoding is

1096
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,200
such that that they are outside the

1097
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,720
association object

1098
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,800
and maybe we add a paragraph which says

1099
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,359
that oh by the way these can be used uh

1100
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,280
pretty easily for other

1101
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,000
uh

1102
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,960
other

1103
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,440
non-sr policy cases but the main use

1104
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,760
case is still sr policy that's why they

1105
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,520
belong in this document and we don't

1106
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,359
want to put them in a separate document

1107
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,599
so some thinking i i think authors

1108
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,280
should think so that that point come

1109
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,640
across and i wanted to get the working

1110
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,400
group feedback also whether that's the

1111
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,400
right approach or not

1112
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,960
uh yeah thanks point taken uh yeah like

1113
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,119
sr policy architecture was the first to

1114
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,800
kind of standardize

1115
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,040
these behaviors right but they

1116
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,760
uh in fact existed even you know before

1117
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,760
sr policy so

1118
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,680
uh so that was my reasoning of why i put

1119
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,200
them in this draft but you know i'm

1120
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,960
definitely open to whatever

1121
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,680
people decide

1122
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,079
thanks mike

1123
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,079
thanks

1124
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,680
so next we have uh luke

1125
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,760
go ahead look

1126
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,800
hello everyone i'm look fabulous d4 from

1127
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,319
mtn

1128
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,280
and

1129
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,839
i'll be presenting an update on the

1130
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,800
support of the pad mtu in the pce

1131
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,839
protocol on the behalf of milk waters

1132
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,880
so next slide please

1133
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,319
so uh it is good again to recall the

1134
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:58,240
motivation of this uh draft uh you see

1135
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,960
uh in the traditional mpls the pattern

1136
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,240
to you could be signaled by our

1137
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,839
rsvpt and ldp

1138
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,400
but now when we come to the segment

1139
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,000
routing parts

1140
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,920
we are not yet at

1141
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,040
the

1142
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,040
additional signaling

1143
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,000
so the sr tunnel cannot currently

1144
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,800
support the negotiation mechanism for

1145
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,480
part mt

1146
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,240
and

1147
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,440
when

1148
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,160
when seats are pushed in a packet

1149
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,400
the packet will be dropped uh

1150
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,240
fragmented and forwarding since the

1151
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,079
packet size

1152
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,839
might exist the part mtu so uh from the

1153
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,000
operator point of view

1154
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,960
uh it is important that uh using these

1155
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,520
lines over multi domains the mtu should

1156
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,680
be length and to avoid drop in packets

1157
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,319
so this uh draft is to specify the

1158
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,079
extensions for

1159
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:59,200
uh the psep to carry the pattern to you

1160
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,599
in the messages

1161
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,720
exploit please

1162
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,040
so uh in terms of history of the draft

1163
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,319
the version 2 was presented in the iitf

1164
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,640
108 and we received comments and

1165
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,319
suggestions

1166
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,440
and

1167
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,839
with these comments were being

1168
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:25,760
captured in the version 3 which were

1169
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,800
a terminology session that was added to

1170
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,079
clarify the confusing terms

1171
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,640
the mtu the link mtu and the pattern to

1172
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,079
you

1173
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,119
a parent adjustment session which was

1174
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,119
also added in the case of protection

1175
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,760
such as dti lfa

1176
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,200
and we did some editorial changes

1177
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,119
now this version 3 was presented in the

1178
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,480
ietf 109 we still received

1179
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,720
where we requested abduction

1180
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,720
there were some comments that still came

1181
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,280
up that were captured in version 4 which

1182
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,720
were

1183
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,920
takes

1184
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,000
that were added to clarify the

1185
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,200
relationship with the maximum seed depth

1186
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,400
and texture was added to support the

1187
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,000
multipath as specified in the draft

1188
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,800
ita pc multipath

1189
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,760
so uh this version 5 that we have

1190
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,200
we are saying p pad m2 is very very

1191
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,079
important for network operators and we

1192
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,760
once again

1193
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,880
request a working group adoption of this

1194
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,960
of this draft

1195
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,880
so thank you

1196
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,000
thanks luke

1197
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,280
are there any questions for luke

1198
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,760
thank you luke for your presentation

1199
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,440
thanks for keeping the document up to

1200
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,760
date and handling all the comments thank

1201
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,680
you and cheers we'll discuss

1202
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,119
and we'll

1203
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:00,960
look out for the wiki where we will

1204
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,800
update our adoption queue thank you

1205
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,200
so let's move on to uh julian you want

1206
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,880
to

1207
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,400
jump in

1208
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,440
no please go on i was not to call for

1209
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,599
giuseppe

1210
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:24,559
okay

1211
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,119
uh joseph you are next thank you yeah

1212
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,480
hello hello

1213
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,400
yeah this is an update about the psap

1214
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,920
extension to enable uh i feed so next

1215
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,920
life

1216
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,079
yeah just a few words about background

1217
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,119
and motivation my feet refers to all

1218
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,599
that are playing on par telemetry uh

1219
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,240
c2im and alternate marking and

1220
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,839
we also include the reference to the

1221
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:49,599
relevant document for these

1222
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:50,960
methodologies

1223
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,240
so

1224
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,640
the dpsep extension they find these

1225
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,960
documents allowed to signal

1226
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,480
the feed capabilities and um

1227
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,599
we address the the initial comment and

1228
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:04,400
uh

1229
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,119
the effete attributes can be generalized

1230
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,440
and included as tlb

1231
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,559
uh

1232
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,839
carried in the lspa object and so this

1233
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:16,960
generalized this application

1234
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,680
since it can be applied to rupa types as

1235
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,839
long as of course they support the data

1236
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,079
plane telemetry meter

1237
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,720
next slide

1238
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,520
yeah the lattice changes are mainly

1239
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,680
related to the application scenario so

1240
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,680
according to rfc 8799 and also according

1241
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,400
to some discussions we had during the

1242
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,520
asg evaluation of the

1243
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,200
for example of the ultimate marketing

1244
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,440
draft in 1986 and also for ec2 rm all

1245
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,680
these on par telemetry technology

1246
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,800
suggested that can be applied in

1247
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,559
a controlled domain

1248
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,119
and according to this recondition we

1249
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,280
also improve the security sections

1250
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,800
considerations

1251
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,079
to

1252
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,720
to define that ifit data must be

1253
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,280
propagated in a limited domain

1254
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,040
also always for security

1255
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,520
to address the security concerns

1256
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,559
and this also is discussing the relevant

1257
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,079
um

1258
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,040
data plane document and we also include

1259
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,319
some considerations in

1260
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,559
in this document as well

1261
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,839
so next slide

1262
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,960
yeah this is just a recap about the

1263
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,559
what's uh what is the proposal of the

1264
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,119
draft first we define a new ifit

1265
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,240
capability tlv that is an optional tlb

1266
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,559
to be used in the open object

1267
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,800
there are five flags that we have

1268
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,160
defined

1269
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,839
uh four are for iom

1270
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,640
type enabled flag so for your allocated

1271
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,200
resumption incremental resolution

1272
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,680
and so on and another flag is to enable

1273
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,000
alternate markings

1274
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,839
next

1275
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:08,400
slide

1276
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,520
uh in addition we define the icitatious

1277
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,640
tlv

1278
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,079
uh that provides the configurable nodes

1279
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,040
of the features and it can be included

1280
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,920
as optional in the lspa object as a as i

1281
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,680
mentioned before

1282
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,400
uh next slide

1283
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,160
yeah in in this slide we can see the

1284
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,599
detail of the subtleties for iom

1285
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,000
as i said there are four

1286
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,720
uh

1287
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,720
options for uh

1288
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,680
option sub qd for ion

1289
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,919
next

1290
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,520
yeah and this is the subtle d for

1291
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,000
alternate marquee

1292
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,839
so next is why isn't the last

1293
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,480
yeah regarding the discussion and next

1294
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,200
steps we can say that um effect methods

1295
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,800
are becoming

1296
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,720
mature also for sr mpls on the 36

1297
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,130
and

1298
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:04,319
[Music]

1299
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,119
from this point of view this the tlv

1300
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,200
here define also complement the draft

1301
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,800
that was presented

1302
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,640
before by mike on

1303
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,839
uh pca segment routing policy cp to

1304
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,680
enable to enable lesser policy with the

1305
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,760
natives by feet but in the end this is

1306
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,160
general so this can be applicable

1307
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,440
um

1308
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,680
to all the part types when the data

1309
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,559
plane telemetry techniques is

1310
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,040
uh has been defined so

1311
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,000
we are also working on ipv6 data plane

1312
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,160
to to define the

1313
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,559
for example the alternate marquee for at

1314
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,400
least other places

1315
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,200
uh and yeah that's all so

1316
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,280
we asked the working group to consider

1317
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,440
the adoption of this work so what some

1318
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,000
questions

1319
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,079
thank you thank you

1320
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,680
any questions for giuseppe

1321
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,040
uh looking at the last uh minutes there

1322
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,040
was one comment regarding the registry

1323
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,160
for flax uh did uh did we take an action

1324
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,319
on it or did we decide not to do it uh

1325
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,319
could you update on that

1326
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,079
um

1327
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,480
no no i didn't uh i didn't take action

1328
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,200
but

1329
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,880
uh

1330
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,359
yeah to be honest i forgot but yeah it's

1331
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:23,119
something that we can consider yeah

1332
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,760
thank you

1333
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,319
any questions otherwise we'll move to

1334
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,759
the last presentation for today

1335
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,599
okay

1336
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,559
why mo go ahead yes can you hear me

1337
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:37,760
yes

1338
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,319
okay thank you hello everyone today i'm

1339
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,720
going to talk about the pc

1340
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,440
for path increase protections

1341
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,079
next page

1342
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,559
two english protection

1343
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,760
drops have been merged into one as

1344
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,520
suggested

1345
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,240
so this merger draft

1346
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,599
provides protection ingress protections

1347
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:06,400
of two types of path

1348
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,839
sr pass

1349
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,480
on the blte path

1350
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,839
in addition

1351
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:14,319
this merger draft

1352
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:17,119
provide a foundation

1353
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:18,319
for

1354
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:19,680
protecting

1355
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,359
ingress nodes

1356
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:24,960
of different type of path

1357
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,599
next page

1358
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,480
increase protection capability sub trv

1359
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,240
is updated

1360
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,520
to include a new field

1361
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,280
which is a

1362
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,480
path type indicate indicators field

1363
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,640
so this field

1364
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,119
is to indicate

1365
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,040
the type of

1366
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,720
passes whose increased protection

1367
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,280
are supported

1368
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,480
flag

1369
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,760
set one indicates that

1370
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,880
the increased protection of sr pass is

1371
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,880
supported

1372
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,599
flag b center one

1373
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,440
indicates that

1374
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,559
the increased production of a bat path

1375
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,400
is supported

1376
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,720
next page

1377
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,880
english

1378
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,480
protection

1379
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,680
sub trv is also updated

1380
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,480
to

1381
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,720
include

1382
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,160
the pass type indicator field so this

1383
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,400
field is used to indicate

1384
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,400
the type of path

1385
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,480
whose increase

1386
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,480
is protected or is to be protected

1387
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,200
so two flags are two flags are defined

1388
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,480
here so one flag is as flag

1389
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,160
yes flag set one indicates that

1390
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,240
the increased production

1391
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,160
of sr paths is

1392
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,319
going to be

1393
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,880
provided

1394
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:09,839
flag

1395
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:12,559
b set one indicates that

1396
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,400
inverse protection

1397
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,760
of

1398
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,599
bft brte pass

1399
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,399
so next page

1400
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,520
so uh

1401
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,359
what comes our webcam

1402
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:30,079
so in addition we would like to request

1403
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:32,240
for work working good work adoptions

1404
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,720
thank you

1405
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:41,558
any questions for whoever

1406
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:49,520
uh uh uh thanks for first merging the uh

1407
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,040
the two documents

1408
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,960
uh but one query that i have is uh like

1409
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,960
first first let me ask you this question

1410
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,160
what happens to rsvpt is this not re

1411
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,279
useful for rhpe

1412
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,599
uh

1413
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,160
as i mentioned as i said this one

1414
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,119
this can provide two

1415
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:14,480
type of protections sr pass on the blt

1416
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,440
pass

1417
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,400
so if we we wanted to extend this one to

1418
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,359
provide protections for

1419
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:24,640
te pass i think it's easy we just add

1420
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,359
one flag and then maybe

1421
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:28,960
include those

1422
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,240
tlvs for the

1423
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,960
tte pass

1424
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,599
so however what i was getting at is that

1425
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,280
i'm not able to understand why do we

1426
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,119
need to differentiate

1427
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,839
so much like we have path setup type

1428
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,599
path setup type will tell me whether it

1429
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,480
is an sr srv6 beer whatever the

1430
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,200
mechanisms would be anyway the same

1431
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,200
irrespective of what is the path setup

1432
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,920
type so i know from capability it makes

1433
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,839
some sense that oh i want to have a

1434
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,920
separate flag for each of them so that i

1435
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,160
can identify the capability but for rest

1436
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,599
of the procedure

1437
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:06,319
what is the main point to have like you

1438
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:07,119
know

1439
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,319
to have different sections or different

1440
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:12,799
handling for each part setup type i was

1441
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:14,480
thinking that this could be a common

1442
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,559
generic draft and we don't have to talk

1443
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,119
too much about what happens for sr what

1444
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,559
happens for brte what happens to rsvpt

1445
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:23,920
the more

1446
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,240
most of the psa encoding and psep

1447
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,640
procedure remains the same so is that

1448
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,319
correct is my understanding for this

1449
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:31,280
correct

1450
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,400
yes you are yes you're correct uh i'm

1451
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,160
also thinking about the one indeed the

1452
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,960
details so this because this is for

1453
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,240
biker plus

1454
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,799
so for the biker pass we can use uh

1455
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,720
backup plus type because

1456
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,240
when we initiate the pass then there's

1457
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,799
some indications for that

1458
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:52,960
by the past time right

1459
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,000
so

1460
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,160
so that can we have enough information

1461
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,720
for the past past hype

1462
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,200
and here uh so we

1463
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,839
have uh

1464
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:06,160
explicitly indicate that this type

1465
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,200
i think maybe just give a emphasize so

1466
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,119
this one is okay as i mentioned that we

1467
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:11,839
just

1468
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,440
because we already have

1469
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,119
those past typing information it's okay

1470
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,799
it's okay

1471
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:20,559
for that one for the

1472
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:22,960
ingress protection subject we can remove

1473
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,000
that uh

1474
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,319
uh past time indicator is you're right

1475
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:27,760
it's okay

1476
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,000
uh thank you let's uh take the questions

1477
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,839
from the queue uh jeffrey

1478
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:39,520
jeffrey go ahead

1479
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:44,559
sorry i didn't see jeffrey here

1480
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:48,559
oh sorry i'm so sorry so sorry go ahead

1481
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,880
okay and i'd like to know

1482
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,280
if this draft has been discussed in

1483
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,119
spring and the beer working group

1484
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,520
uh

1485
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,160
no no because this one is a

1486
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,920
extension for

1487
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,559
for pc

1488
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,240
in my opinion i think that we should

1489
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,880
discuss this kind of use case in a

1490
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,200
spring and a beer working group

1491
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,200
at first

1492
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,520
thanks

1493
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,440
thank you mike uh quickly

1494
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:25,520
four comments uh

1495
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,359
just to confirm like uh this is this

1496
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,599
requires a connection to the ce right to

1497
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,440
it requires pc to

1498
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,160
to talk to the ce device right

1499
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,118
not exactly

1500
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:39,200
okay

1501
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,520
maybe just kind of elaborate if you

1502
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,440
could elaborate on that like uh in the

1503
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,799
draft

1504
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:46,559
and uh it would be also good to know

1505
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,400
like which types of

1506
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,000
uh service overlay this uh will

1507
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,960
uh apply to like l3 vpn i assume it's

1508
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,500
not throughout to vpn

1509
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,839
[Music]

1510
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:00,240
yeah yes

1511
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,839
in the draft we uh we mentioned that in

1512
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:06,319
some cases we need a

1513
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:07,920
communication with ce

1514
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,880
yes you're right

1515
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,359
okay yeah so also my second comment just

1516
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:15,119
to mention different like overlay types

1517
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,240
that it applies to you

1518
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,520
yes yes

1519
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,880
