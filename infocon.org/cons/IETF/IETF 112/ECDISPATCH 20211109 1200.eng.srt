1
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,160
all right

2
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,480
i think we're at the top of the hour and

3
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,440
why don't we get started uh good morning

4
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,680
good afternoon good evening uh kind of

5
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,840
everyone and welcome to the security

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,039
area advisory group meeting uh this is

7
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,600
uh session one that we're holding now my

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
name is roman de nilo i'm one of the

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,440
sekidi sec

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,800
and my cosec id is ben kadek then if you

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,680
want to turn on your video

12
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,799
all right uh if we can go next slide

13
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,799
please

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,479
so two things we want to

15
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,560
talk about before we really get started

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,880
but are the slides flipping or

17
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,360
is this an artifact

18
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,560
ah perfect thanks so there's two things

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,240
we wanted to talk about of course we

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,960
have first the notewell which covers the

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,280
various policies and procedures related

22
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,799
to how we do work here at the ietf if we

23
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,119
could flip to the next slide

24
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,960
but in particular what we want to do is

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
call out uh one of those things from the

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,799
notewell which is our code of conduct

27
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,880
and so this is really a reminder as

28
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,320
documented in rfc 7154

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,280
that we extend courtesy and respect to

30
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,840
our colleagues that when we talk about

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,320
things we focus on the technical bits of

32
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,560
it not necessarily the messenger and the

33
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,479
particular individuals involved so let's

34
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,399
not uh kind of focus on the person let's

35
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,479
focus on the tech itself and just a

36
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,239
reminder that we're all coming actually

37
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,920
from different contexts different kind

38
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,160
of perspectives so remember that

39
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,080
assumptions about what operational

40
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,280
environments or the technical

41
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,200
environments may actually be different

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,360
than what you consider that particular

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,120
kind of environment so please do give

44
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,959
the benefit of the doubt to different

45
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,720
participants

46
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,040
next slide please

47
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,680
so you'll notice uh in the agenda here

48
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,599
and on the on the 112 schedule that

49
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,360
we're doing something different than

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,120
what we usually do we like to have sex

51
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,560
dispatch early in the week we like to

52
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,959
have sag a little bit later in this week

53
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,879
but to accommodate different kind of

54
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,360
presenters we're doing a we're doing a

55
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,680
hybrid here so a split session so the

56
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,360
first hour of this meeting is going to

57
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,760
be focused on sag the second hour is

58
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,160
going to be sec dispatch and on thursday

59
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,239
we're also going to split the time uh

60
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,640
sag will take the first hour and if sec

61
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
dispatch needs it we're gonna we're

62
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,840
gonna have them in the in the second uh

63
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,480
in the second hour so the agenda roughly

64
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,879
kind of splits like this where

65
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,239
uh today in continuing largely on the

66
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,400
conversation we had in the last ietf

67
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,000
meeting about what post-quantum

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,080
cartography agility will look like last

69
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,000
time we talked a little bit about what

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,560
we would be doing in the ietf uh this

71
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,280
time around uh graciously nist uh

72
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,440
specifically dustin moody who's the post

73
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,280
quantum cryptography project lead at

74
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,200
nist has agreed to come here to tell us

75
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,360
about where that kind of project stands

76
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,000
and we have some time from some open mic

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,360
and then on thursday we're going to do

78
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,879
all the different administrative kind of

79
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,159
activities talk about working group

80
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,040
reports the ad reports and other topics

81
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,400
but thank you of course to the working

82
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,799
group chairs who have set updates uh

83
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,879
preparing for that this morning

84
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,120
uh we're not gonna do any agenda bashing

85
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
here we're gonna save that flexibility

86
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
for thursday you know today we just

87
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,680
really are gonna focus on our invited uh

88
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,560
on our invited talk so uh kind of with

89
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,640
no further ado ben uh unless you would

90
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,239
like to add something let's kind of move

91
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,480
over to dustin

92
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,480
okay thanks so much uh the floor is

93
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,080
yours dustin we're gonna flip to your

94
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,920
slides now

95
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,000
okay thank you very much i appreciate

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,320
the invitation to come and speak here to

97
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,519
the itf

98
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,560
um

99
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,880
hopefully you're seeing and hearing me

100
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,199
not seen my slides yet hopefully you'll

101
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,199
get them in a moment

102
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,600
so i plan to talk for about 30 minutes

103
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,120
or so and leave plenty of time for

104
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,880
questions at the end

105
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,080
so i know that

106
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,440
there's lots of things you might want to

107
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,199
ask so

108
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,120
again yeah i'm dustin moody from nist

109
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,960
and nist as you probably are very well

110
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,520
aware is leading a post quantum

111
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,440
cryptography standardization project

112
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,639
which we're nearing the end of and

113
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,639
that's what i will be speaking about

114
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,240
today

115
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,040
next slide

116
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,240
so the motivation is probably pretty

117
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,880
clear um it's well known that there are

118
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,720
quantum computers that are actively

119
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,800
being researched and built that if they

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,759
are

121
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,160
constructed to a large size where they

122
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,080
can do pretty good computations

123
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,840
that these quantum computers would have

124
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,639
a noticeable impact on cryptography

125
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,000
and we've seen in the press over the

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,360
past few years

127
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,440
progress being made

128
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,960
there are certainly still challenges to

129
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,000
be overcome it's not an easy problem

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,759
but quantum computers if they are

131
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,160
built they will be sufficiently powerful

132
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,840
to give us computational power for

133
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,479
certain problems it won't solve every

134
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,120
problem that we want to tackle

135
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,199
but they would give us a lot of very

136
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,240
good applications in science

137
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,160
okay let's go to the

138
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,880
next slide

139
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,039
so at nist the the threat to

140
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,320
cryptography is what we're focused on

141
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,039
it's well known that shore's algorithm

142
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,960
it's been known for a couple of decades

143
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,800
would break the public key crypto

144
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,440
algorithms that we use today commonly

145
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,880
that includes algorithms like rsa ecdsa

146
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,120
the elliptic curve diffie-hellman finite

147
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,440
field dsa

148
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,520
and these are standardized in three of

149
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,720
our documents at nist s p 800 56 a and b

150
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,280
which deal with key establishment

151
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,400
and

152
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,080
public key encryption

153
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,720
and then fips 186 which is our digital

154
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,960
signature standard

155
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,000
so

156
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
if a quantum computer comes online it

157
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,080
would completely

158
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,600
break those standards we need to

159
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,680
completely just remove them and get new

160
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,840
algorithms

161
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,600
so the threat is to public key

162
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,919
cryptography the most and that's where

163
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,000
the focus of post-quantum cryptography

164
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,840
is

165
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,680
a quantum computers would also be able

166
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,759
to impact symmetric key crypto so we

167
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,520
have various symmetric algorithms like

168
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,560
aes and sha-2 and sha-3

169
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,919
but the effect would be a lot less

170
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,160
dramatic grover's algorithm would give

171
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
you a polynomial speed up not an

172
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,919
exponential speed up

173
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,080
but we could handle that by increasing

174
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,240
key size using longer output from the

175
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,680
hash functions

176
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,520
so we wouldn't need to completely scrap

177
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,360
the algorithms we just need to change

178
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,919
how we use them and that's that's easier

179
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,440
to handle than coming out with new

180
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,000
algorithms

181
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,720
so next slide

182
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
so there are many names given to this

183
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,120
area sometimes it's post quantum

184
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,280
cryptography it's also called quantum

185
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,120
resistant cryptography quantum safe

186
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,639
cryptography

187
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,240
but the idea is that we're looking for

188
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,479
cryptosystems which will be

189
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,400
implemented on our current classical

190
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,240
computers because that will still be

191
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,680
what everyone is mostly using

192
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,680
but they need to provide security

193
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
against attacks from both classical and

194
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,639
quantum computers

195
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,400
now quantum computers there is progress

196
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,879
being made but they're not yet here so

197
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,319
we may ask the question you know why do

198
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,479
we need to worry about this now

199
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,960
and there's a a simple explanation from

200
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,080
dr michele mosca that

201
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,400
explains why there's a threat now even

202
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,240
if we do not yet have a large-scale

203
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,800
quantum computer

204
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,319
and the idea is kind of there's a

205
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,479
there's a harvest now decrypt later

206
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,000
threat

207
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,560
that your your adversary could be

208
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,800
copying down your your data and it's

209
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,000
encrypted

210
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and you can't read it right now but he

211
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,440
will wait until there's a quantum

212
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,360
computer that comes along

213
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,280
and then he'll be able to get access to

214
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,639
it

215
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,520
and

216
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
this little equation if x plus y is

217
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,280
greater than z helps you measure that

218
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,560
risk

219
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,440
um

220
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,839
if x is how long you need your your data

221
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,279
to be protected

222
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,679
and y is how long until we have uh

223
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,320
post-quantum algorithms standardized and

224
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,279
widely

225
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,159
implemented and adopted

226
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,760
and if z is how long until there's a

227
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,440
quantum computer

228
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,160
well if x plus y is greater than z

229
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,399
they will decrypt your data and you will

230
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,560
not be providing the x years of

231
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,240
information security that you're hoping

232
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,519
for

233
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,920
so you can put in what x and y and z are

234
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,760
for your particular

235
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,240
organization your application to see if

236
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,360
you could be at risk already

237
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,600
being in standards we know that y is not

238
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,519
as small as we might hope

239
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,080
you know y is more likely going to be 10

240
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,839
15 years

241
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,320
to get good standardization

242
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,480
adopted we've seen that in the past with

243
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,560
crypto transitions

244
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,120
x will depend on your organization the

245
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,360
application

246
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,920
could be due to regulations where you've

247
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,680
got to keep health information private

248
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,920
or you're protecting financial data

249
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,880
if you're worried about national

250
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,959
security x could be really long like 30

251
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,720
years

252
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,240
so it's important to have an idea of

253
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,800
kind of what what z might be then

254
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,160
so if we go to the next slide

255
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,519
there are various experts around the

256
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,920
world who were surveyed

257
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,160
in this quantum threat timeline report

258
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,680
that was done by the global risk

259
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,800
institute

260
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,200
that tried to give give an idea of when

261
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,120
quantum computers that would be big

262
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,680
enough to break public key cryptography

263
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,200
could be around

264
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,959
of course it's an open research question

265
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,120
so nobody knows for sure

266
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,600
but they they surveyed 44 experts in the

267
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,040
field and asked them

268
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,720
what is the likelihood

269
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,360
in five years in 10 years and 15 years

270
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,200
that we would have a big enough quantum

271
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,440
computer that would break the public key

272
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,079
crypto that we use

273
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,480
this chart is kind of it summarizes

274
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,920
their findings although you need to go

275
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,600
to the the full report to see all the

276
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,720
details

277
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,040
you can see in five years

278
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,440
a majority of the those surveyed thought

279
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
there was a pretty little risk

280
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,600
less than one percent or at the most

281
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,680
maybe five percent

282
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,240
if you start going down further at 10

283
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,279
years

284
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,959
15 years

285
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,839
at 15 years we start to see that

286
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,000
there's almost half of the people

287
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,320
surveyed we're starting to give a fairly

288
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
significant

289
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,000
probability that we could have a quantum

290
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,279
computer

291
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,279
so in terms of managing risk we can see

292
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,160
that maybe 10 years 15 years and in

293
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,880
their opinion certainly by 20 years this

294
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,560
is something we need to be

295
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,800
working on today and seriously

296
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,279
considering

297
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,320
next slide

298
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,720
so to just be clear uh

299
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,000
sometimes when we're talking about

300
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,560
cryptography and quantum

301
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,240
there's another side of the coin that

302
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,000
that is mentioned and i want to make

303
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,760
sure that you're clear that that's not

304
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,480
what i'm talking about today

305
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,920
um quantum cryptography uh also the term

306
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,640
qkd or quantum key distribution

307
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,040
is using quantum technology to build

308
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,560
cryptosystems

309
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,839
and there's some pretty interesting

310
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,519
things that can be done here you can

311
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,519
actually get theoretically unconditional

312
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,279
security that's guaranteed by the laws

313
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,680
of physics

314
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,200
there are some important applications

315
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,000
where this might be the right solution

316
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,399
but this is unlikely to to be what is

317
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,279
widely used on the internet

318
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,360
the way it is right now it's not very

319
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,279
scalable it's very expensive you need

320
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,720
special hardware

321
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,000
you can do encryption but not

322
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,160
authentication

323
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,320
so this is not what our focus is is on

324
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,160
right now in this project we do have

325
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,920
people at nist looking at this and other

326
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,399
researchers around the world are as well

327
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,000
but our post quantum cryptography

328
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,360
project is on

329
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,680
looking for classical cryptosystems to

330
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,040
replace the ones that would be broken

331
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,839
go ahead next slide

332
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,839
so nist has been looking at this for

333
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,959
over a decade but it was around 2016

334
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,800
that we began to take some concrete

335
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,399
steps um in this project to get

336
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,480
standardization happening

337
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,240
so we first published a report and

338
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,160
announced that we would be doing a large

339
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,279
international

340
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,120
competition-like process similar to what

341
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,600
we've done in the past with aes and with

342
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,839
shaw three

343
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,680
so we put out a call for proposals we

344
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,639
put out our evaluation criteria

345
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,639
and then we gave submitters plenty of

346
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,040
time to design their algorithms

347
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,120
we received 82 different algorithms in

348
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,160
which 69 met our requirements and

349
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,279
were accepted into the first round

350
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,800
and since then we proceeded through a

351
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,200
number of rounds where during the round

352
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,360
that lasted uh about a year a year and a

353
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,560
half

354
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,639
we would evaluate the candidates

355
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,639
internally we would look at them as well

356
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,360
as the cryptographic community around

357
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,120
the world as well

358
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,399
looking at their security their

359
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,279
performance and so on and so forth

360
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,040
at the end of each round we would select

361
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,120
the most promising ones to to move on

362
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,959
for further study

363
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,200
so we went to a second round

364
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,120
and then we went to a third round which

365
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,040
is where we are now

366
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
at the end of each round we issued a

367
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,279
report explaining our decision and in

368
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,600
each round we also held a workshop where

369
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,040
submitters could come and talk about

370
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,880
their algorithms and other research

371
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,959
that's relevant could be presented

372
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,959
so i'll talk about this in more detail

373
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,560
as we go on but this is kind of the

374
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,360
overall timeline of our project in the

375
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,160
past few years

376
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,040
so the criteria that we announced we

377
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,720
would be using to

378
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,040
judge these algorithms number one is

379
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
security we need these to be secure

380
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,560
against both classical and quantum

381
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,760
attacks

382
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,600
and security is the most important

383
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,519
criteria

384
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,639
um

385
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,720
that said it's not always easy to

386
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,399
measure security in a concrete way

387
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,360
especially against quantum attacks

388
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,040
quantum computers are not yet built we

389
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,480
don't know how expensive they'll be to

390
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
run we do not know how fast they will be

391
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,760
to run

392
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,399
so we have to make some guesses and some

393
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,959
extrapolations

394
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,279
and there's there's some uncertainty

395
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,839
built into that

396
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,560
we designed five security categories so

397
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,480
that submitters could give us parameters

398
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,000
to tell us

399
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,480
what how much security

400
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,320
their algorithms would be providing with

401
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,639
certain parameter sets

402
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,199
and we related this back to

403
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,199
the the amount of resources it would

404
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,199
take to break some of our symmetric key

405
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,560
algorithms

406
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,120
um kind of an unusual way to define it

407
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,120
but this is kind of the what we came up

408
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,760
with at the time

409
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,320
level one meant that your algorithm was

410
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,800
providing as much security it would take

411
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,480
as many resources to break it as it

412
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,800
would take resources to break aes doing

413
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,959
an exhaustive key search

414
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,800
and then we went on from there levels

415
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,199
two three four and five

416
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,800
we think levels one two and three should

417
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,240
provide enough security for the next

418
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,680
several decades

419
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,079
and we have levels four and five for

420
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,560
very high secure needs

421
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,639
besides security uh performance is

422
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,720
obviously very important if things are

423
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,959
too slow or too large we won't be able

424
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,240
to use them

425
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,839
so we would measure performance in a

426
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,240
variety of different platforms both on

427
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,600
software hardware small devices and so

428
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,639
we could see

429
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,160
the comparisons between the different

430
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,519
algorithms

431
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,279
as we'll see there's not one silver

432
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,519
bullet that is just magically the best

433
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,880
in in all different categories

434
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,279
we also looked at or we also asked that

435
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,480
submitters talk about other properties

436
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,759
and that we would evaluate the

437
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,759
algorithms on these as well

438
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,600
as much as possible we hope for a drop

439
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,959
in replacement

440
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,720
we want perfect forward secrecy

441
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,759
resistance to side channel attacks

442
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,759
the simpler the better it's easier to

443
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,959
analyze

444
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,639
and less likely to make mistakes when

445
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,320
implementing things like that

446
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,360
okay next slide

447
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,279
so we had submissions from around the

448
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,399
world

449
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,800
there was several hundred submitters

450
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,320
that were involved with the the

451
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,519
algorithms

452
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,360
and if you put them on a map they were

453
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,320
from

454
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,120
all six continents and over 25 different

455
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,680
countries around the globe so that was

456
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
nice to see that we have a worldwide

457
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,759
effort going on here

458
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,320
next slide

459
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,800
and summarizing the first round so we

460
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,440
had a lot of algorithms that we we

461
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,040
published on our website we put their

462
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,959
specs up we had the code there so you

463
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,199
could download and implement them

464
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,439
there was a lot of schemes that were

465
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,599
very quickly attacked cryptographers

466
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,919
love trying to break new things

467
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,799
and of the 69 i would say in the first

468
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,319
month or two

469
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,199
probably about 15 to 20 of them

470
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,079
had attacks that severely weakened or

471
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,880
broke a lot of those schemes about 15 to

472
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,959
20 of them

473
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,720
we also noticed there was a lot of very

474
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,559
similar ideas in what was submitted to

475
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,360
us

476
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,720
particularly in looking at lattice chems

477
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,320
so we asked for public key digital

478
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,640
signatures and the other category we

479
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,039
asked for was public key encryption

480
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,960
or equivalently key encapsulation

481
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,400
mechanisms

482
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
and in that table down in the bottom

483
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,679
right you can see uh kind of the

484
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,440
categories of

485
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,200
the type of algorithm

486
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,960
as well as the mathematical primitive

487
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,799
that was based on

488
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,799
and we had the most that were based on

489
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,960
lattices and codes for chems

490
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
we held a workshop where the submission

491
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,480
teams were invited to come and present

492
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,400
their algorithms

493
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,919
had a lot of

494
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,280
discussion there

495
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,799
a lot of good attendance there that was

496
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,240
held jointly with the pq crypto workshop

497
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,720
we established an online message forum

498
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,200
called the pqc forum where we could keep

499
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,039
track of comments about the algorithms

500
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,440
people could ask questions

501
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,600
discuss research results

502
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,360
that forum continues today and is an

503
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,640
active area where there's a lot of

504
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,360
discussion uh going on there

505
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,960
and in the first round we started to to

506
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,440
get research and the first performance

507
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,280
numbers as well so we could we could

508
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,000
start evaluating these schemes

509
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,320
after a year we made some hard decisions

510
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,280
and we selected 26 of the schemes to

511
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,960
move on

512
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
into the second round

513
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,039
so next slide

514
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,880
also going on into the second round we

515
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,440
encourage some submit some submissions

516
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,960
to merge

517
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,720
that were very similar and we saw some

518
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,440
ford four uh different mergers continued

519
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,679
on and they all advanced into the second

520
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:06,960
round

521
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,559
the idea with the second round was that

522
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,240
we wanted to maintain the diversity of

523
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,320
algorithms but select the ones that were

524
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,559
most promising so we still had a number

525
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,360
of lattice-based code based multivariate

526
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,559
signatures and so on and so forth

527
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,760
the second round was a lot like the

528
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,320
first cryptanalysis continued some

529
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,880
algorithms continued to get broken

530
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,799
we held a workshop more research

531
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,120
after 18 months we had 15 submissions

532
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,760
that we picked to move on into the third

533
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,160
round

534
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,120
and we let we can go ahead and yeah next

535
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,840
yeah we can go to the next slide

536
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,520
so there are some tough decisions here

537
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,480
uh

538
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,840
if you've been following the process you

539
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,280
can see some of the submissions that

540
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,120
were on the left now these were the

541
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,440
round two algorithms and we maintain the

542
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,559
diversity going on into round three

543
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,160
showing our our categories for

544
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,640
encryption in chems and for

545
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,320
signatures

546
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,919
they're kind of color coded according to

547
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,520
the mathematical primitive they're based

548
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,440
on so you can see that diversity was

549
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,039
preserved

550
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,880
and

551
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,240
in looking to see how we're going to

552
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,039
make our selections this could kind of

553
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,880
help try and

554
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,200
help provide some understanding

555
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,120
as to how we'll do that where we try and

556
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,280
again keep algorithm diversity

557
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,760
but select only the the ones that appear

558
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,200
to be the best of each type

559
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,159
okay let's move on to the next slide

560
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,840
so currently we are in the third round

561
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,240
we've selected seven finalists

562
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,039
um

563
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,880
and eight alternates the finalists are

564
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,400
the algorithms that we feel are most

565
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,159
likely to be ready for standardization

566
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,080
at the end of the third round

567
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,320
and would fit the most

568
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,360
uh general purpose applications

569
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,200
the alternates we are still interested

570
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,640
in but they would most likely need a

571
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,480
fourth round of study

572
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,559
some of these were selected as kind of

573
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,880
backup candidates if there were research

574
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,720
results

575
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,520
or for certain performance applications

576
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,080
some of these algorithms were suited for

577
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,480
uh the performance was tailored that

578
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,840
they might be appropriate for one

579
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,840
application but maybe not as is good for

580
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,000
general purpose use

581
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,600
uh the chem finals that we had were

582
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,000
kyber and true saber classic mcleese and

583
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,919
the signature finalists were dilithium

584
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,320
falcon and rainbow and then the

585
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,280
alternates are listed there as well

586
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,240
so we go to the next slide

587
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,480
so if we look at the lattice-based chems

588
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,120
three of them were selected as finalists

589
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,000
uh kyber saber and entrue

590
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,240
all three are good all-around candidates

591
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,640
their key sizes are pretty good their

592
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,960
efficiency and implementation

593
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,200
is quite good

594
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,640
kyber and saber a little bit more

595
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,480
similar entries based on a slightly

596
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
different problem but all three we

597
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,799
selected as finalists

598
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,960
uh we had n true prime as an alternate

599
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,600
and frodo cam was also an alternate

600
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,440
frodo cam made a

601
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,240
a

602
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,919
security performance trade-off where

603
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,280
they were a little bit more security

604
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
they did not use structured lattices so

605
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,720
the key sizes are a little bit bigger

606
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,120
performance is a little bit smaller

607
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,320
but

608
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,840
potentially it provides a more

609
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,280
conservative security option

610
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,600
okay next slide

611
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,159
in looking at the remainder of the chems

612
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,159
three of them were based on codes

613
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,240
classic mclease which if you've been in

614
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,320
cryptography you've heard that before

615
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,880
it's been around for a long time

616
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,240
it was selected as a finalist

617
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,840
very large public keys very small

618
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,240
ciphertext very efficient for some

619
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,559
applications that would work well

620
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,120
a bike in hqc introduced some structure

621
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,039
to get the public keys down a little bit

622
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,640
smaller

623
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,360
we're very interested in having another

624
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,480
general purpose cam based on codes

625
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,600
bike and htc look like good candidates

626
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,200
so we will likely

627
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,039
go to the fourth round to see if if

628
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,200
either of them will be standardized

629
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,520
and then we have psych which is based on

630
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,159
isogenies of elliptic curves very small

631
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,640
keys but it's a little bit

632
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,159
slower than all of its competitors

633
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,159
uh next slide

634
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,840
so here's a couple of charts just to

635
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,480
show you kind of uh

636
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,720
the different key sizes that we're we're

637
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,559
looking at and to some extent this is

638
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,640
informed by the the mathematical

639
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,720
primitive that they're based on

640
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,280
i do note that on the axis these are

641
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,760
logarithmically scaled

642
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,840
you can see that the orange one psych

643
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,640
has the smallest key sizes and then the

644
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,480
lattice-based algorithms

645
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,480
and the code-based algorithms

646
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,880
and then frodo that blue dot up in kind

647
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,559
of the top

648
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,919
is up there

649
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,520
and the gray dot in the far right is

650
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,600
classic mclease with very large public

651
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,720
key very small cipher ciphertext

652
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,799
okay next slide

653
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,919
if we want to look at the efficiency

654
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,360
this is just to give you an idea of the

655
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,200
order of magnitude

656
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,960
performance will

657
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,520
be based on you know what what platform

658
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,360
you're implementing it on

659
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,679
again note that the cycle counts on the

660
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,120
left here are in

661
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,760
a logarithmic scale

662
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,159
and you can see that some of the best

663
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,840
performance numbers we're getting from

664
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,960
our our lattice cams kyber entry saber

665
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,799
entry prime

666
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,760
and then

667
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,440
you can see the code base ones a little

668
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,760
bit slower

669
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,520
and then psych

670
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,480
has slower key gen and caps and d caps

671
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,880
than a lot of the the other algorithms

672
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,279
it's competing against

673
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,159
okay next slide

674
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,480
so if we look at the signatures we have

675
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,440
two

676
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,200
lattice-based signatures dilithium and

677
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,320
falcon

678
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,000
again both are very balanced they're

679
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,760
very efficient

680
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,080
they were selected as finalists

681
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,000
we had two signatures that were based on

682
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,320
symmetric key primitives we have sphinx

683
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,720
plus which is very stable its security

684
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,320
is very well understood because it's

685
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,720
based on the security of hash functions

686
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,320
it's a little bit larger and slower than

687
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,159
dilithium and falcon

688
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,600
picnic a

689
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,400
very novel design

690
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,480
so we're still looking at that

691
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,240
and then we had rainbow and gems that

692
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,200
were

693
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,679
multivariate signatures

694
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,679
they both tend to have

695
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,360
large public keys very small signatures

696
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,960
pretty efficient at verifying in

697
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,320
particular

698
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,840
however during the third round there's

699
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,840
been some crypt analysis results that

700
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,240
have attacked both rainbow and gems

701
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,559
and call into question their security

702
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,520
for both those algorithms

703
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,039
if we go to the next slide we can look

704
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,640
at a couple charts to see kind of the

705
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,039
sizes that we're looking at for them

706
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,320
again logarithmic scale for the axes

707
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,480
you can see that picnic and sphinx plus

708
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,320
have very small public keys very large

709
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,919
signatures

710
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,919
the gray multivariate very large public

711
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,679
keys small signatures

712
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,720
and the lattices kind of middle ground

713
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,240
where they have

714
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,559
key sizes and signature sizes on the

715
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,559
order of a thousand bytes roughly

716
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,559
next slide

717
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,400
if we look at a chart to look at

718
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,120
performance again a logarithmic scale in

719
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,880
the cycle count

720
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,400
we can see that

721
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,840
each of these algorithms has different

722
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,679
kind of performance areas where they

723
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,840
tend to little do a little bit better

724
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,600
some have better key gen some have a

725
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,960
slower key gen

726
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,039
some verify very much faster

727
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,960
so we can see kind of different

728
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,520
comparisons there

729
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,480
okay next slide

730
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,880
so our timeline we have been in the

731
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,840
third la third round for

732
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,200
over a year

733
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,520
and it will end

734
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,279
roughly the end of this year start of

735
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,200
next year uh right now it's looking

736
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,320
probably more likely it will be the

737
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,640
beginning of 2022

738
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,159
and that is when we will announce which

739
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,600
finalist algorithms that we will

740
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,039
standardize

741
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,799
we've also previously mentioned we may

742
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,679
potentially standardize sphinx plus even

743
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,360
though it's an alternate

744
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,480
um

745
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,760
because we want to make sure we have

746
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,960
more than one signature algorithm and we

747
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,240
had

748
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,360
dilithium in falcon we expect to choose

749
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,120
one of those algorithms

750
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,600
the multivariate signatures

751
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,840
we had some attacks on them

752
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,159
so that is why that might be something

753
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,080
we do

754
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,000
again we we want these algorithms to

755
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,440
include

756
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,520
uh are these these algorithms that we

757
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,840
announced to include

758
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,520
solutions that can be used by most

759
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,960
applications so that's what we're

760
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,760
targeting at the very first especially

761
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,679
we'll also issue a report to explain our

762
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:38,960
decisions

763
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,799
and we will announce any candidates that

764
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,640
we want to advance to a fourth round to

765
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,960
continue to study in a fourth round for

766
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,679
potential standardization

767
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,520
these algorithms that we announce at the

768
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,279
end of the third round we will work with

769
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,960
the submission teams to create draft

770
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,000
standards that we will put out within a

771
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,880
probably ought to take us a year or so

772
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,440
to get public comment

773
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,039
we will address those comments and hope

774
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,440
to get the first set finalize published

775
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,159
by 2024.

776
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,320
okay next slide

777
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,480
so i talked about the signatures um

778
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,240
we have a lot more chems and different

779
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,240
types of chems in signatures we have a

780
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,760
smaller number

781
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,640
so

782
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,320
we're going to introduce at the end of

783
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,320
the third round what we're calling an

784
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
on-ramp for new signatures we will issue

785
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,039
a new call for signatures

786
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,000
that we want designers to design for the

787
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,760
future uh we'll we'll announce a

788
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,919
submission deadline we'll give designers

789
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,559
probably a six months to a year

790
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,360
this will be much smaller scoped project

791
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,080
than what we announced five years ago

792
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,679
we're not looking to get

793
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,559
60 70 80 new algorithms we want a very

794
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,960
small number the main reason is to

795
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,080
diversify our signature portfolio

796
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,600
we're happy with the general purpose

797
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,440
digital signature schemes that are based

798
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,559
on structured lattices that would be uh

799
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,200
dilithium and falcon

800
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,120
but we also want another general purpose

801
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,200
algorithm that's not based on structured

802
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,600
lattices the other ones that we are

803
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,279
still in the third round

804
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,360
they're a little bit bigger or slower in

805
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,799
some areas

806
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,720
so that's our primary target that we're

807
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,000
looking for

808
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,760
you might be convinced to be interested

809
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,640
in some signature schemes that target

810
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,279
certain applications for me for example

811
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,880
if there's a scheme that has very short

812
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,399
signatures that could be something we're

813
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,840
interested in

814
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,440
of course the more mature the scheme the

815
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,760
better and we'll decide when we see what

816
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,200
gets sent in

817
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,960
which if any of the schemes that we want

818
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,440
attention focused on

819
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,159
so next slide

820
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,120
how are we making our decisions well

821
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,960
right now we're already meeting to begin

822
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,080
our process to select the algorithms

823
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,360
we're meeting

824
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,279
frequently we're comparing the

825
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,120
algorithms we're taking a detailed look

826
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,480
again at

827
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,720
their specifications what's happened

828
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,480
during the third round new research

829
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,200
results new performance benchmarks

830
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,480
but we're trying to just follow the

831
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,600
evaluation criteria that we announced

832
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,320
we we said security was number one

833
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,240
then performance and then some of these

834
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,679
other algorithm and implementation

835
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,520
characteristics

836
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,520
for the lattice cams our main decision

837
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,840
will be selecting

838
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,840
an algorithm from kyber and true and

839
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,960
saber

840
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,399
all three are based on structured

841
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,600
lattices have similar performance there

842
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,520
are some differences and that's what's

843
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,480
making this a hard decision

844
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,159
for lattice signatures our main decision

845
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,000
will be looking at dilithium and falcon

846
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,480
um our other choices uh they'll mostly

847
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,760
be made on an individual basis um

848
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,919
if we standardize classic mcleese it's

849
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,640
kind of competing against itself

850
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,760
and so on with the other algorithms

851
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,320
next slide

852
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,559
one issue that's proven to be very

853
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,320
important is

854
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,960
patent and ipr issues and this is a very

855
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,679
complicated area our team is mostly made

856
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,399
up of mathematicians computer scientists

857
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,080
we are not lawyers so we don't

858
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,480
understand all the ip issues

859
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,559
but we acknowledge that the impact of ip

860
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,559
has can be very very important on

861
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,880
adoption of these algorithms

862
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,640
each of the algorithms their submission

863
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,679
teams

864
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,679
gave us sign statements indicating any

865
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,000
patents that they had on the algorithms

866
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,840
but there's an issue

867
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,480
that's arisen with patents from third

868
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,399
parties that are not the designers of

869
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,360
the algorithms nist is actively engaging

870
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,200
to resolve the known issues that we're

871
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,039
aware of

872
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,880
when we have something concrete we will

873
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,640
share it we want to make very clear

874
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,559
though it may not be possible for us to

875
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,600
resolve

876
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,519
all the ip issues

877
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,679
we can't control what outside parties do

878
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,679
completely and

879
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,559
ip is a legal issue and it's not to be

880
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,240
decided based on

881
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,240
uh you know what what i think is a

882
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,320
mathematician

883
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,559
so in light of the above um

884
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,399
we think that this the discussion is

885
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,360
best focused on the impact of ip

886
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,080
how will that affect adoption and how

887
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,080
should we factor that into our decision

888
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,840
making process

889
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,519
we very much want

890
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,080
to select algorithms that will be widely

891
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,240
implemented and adopted and we know that

892
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,120
having any patent or ip

893
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,200
significantly affects that we want to

894
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,240
have

895
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,080
you know standards that are freely

896
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,840
available to everyone to use

897
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,240
next slide

898
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,000
so there has been some work done already

899
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
on stateful hash based signatures the

900
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,440
ietf has two rfcs that standardized xmss

901
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,360
and lms

902
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,519
based on those nist also issued a

903
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,080
standard sp 800 208

904
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,480
that has stateful hash based signatures

905
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,080
want to caution these are not general

906
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,000
purpose digital signatures you have to

907
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,080
carefully manage the state otherwise you

908
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,799
can completely blow your security

909
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,880
so there's both all of these documents

910
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,799
include guidance on how to safely do

911
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,799
this and which applications this is

912
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,480
appropriate for

913
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,640
but wanted to make sure you're aware of

914
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,799
hash based signatures

915
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,200
okay next slide

916
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,080
um

917
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,919
as we look towards the transition one

918
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,240
thing that's being discussed is a a

919
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,720
hybrid mode and that's where you use a

920
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,799
classical algorithm and a post quantum

921
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:21,919
algorithm

922
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,919
in some combination where you're relying

923
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,399
on the security of both algorithms

924
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,399
and this is a potential approach for

925
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,159
migration that many people seem to be

926
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,679
interested in

927
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,919
a nist allows this in one of our

928
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,679
documents

929
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,000
you can combine a shared secret derived

930
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,279
from a

931
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,440
current nist standardized algorithm with

932
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,519
a shared secret derived from some other

933
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,799
way i.e a post quantum algorithm

934
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,080
you can catenate them and run them

935
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,840
through a kdf and you can still get

936
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,360
phipps approval

937
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,840
on on that process as explained in that

938
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,600
document

939
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,440
so we know that there's going to be can

940
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,440
probably continue discussion on the best

941
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,000
way to implement um

942
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,519
any mode where you're combining

943
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,760
algorithms this hasn't really taken a

944
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,079
position on uh the best way of how to do

945
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:08,960
this

946
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,239
uh we think it it certainly is a an

947
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,918
option to consider you take a

948
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,480
performance hit but it's a it's a

949
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,719
perhaps a good way to transition into

950
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,239
the future and getting used to these

951
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,399
post-quantum crypto

952
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,800
algorithms

953
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,918
so let's go to the next slide

954
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,000
nist will issue guidance on the

955
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,079
transition to post quantum algorithms we

956
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,839
don't yet have algorithms announced so

957
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,079
we cannot give that guidance yet

958
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,199
um but we

959
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,199
we've previously given crypto transition

960
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,960
advice and we will do so here um

961
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,079
so let's go to the next slide

962
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,119
uh

963
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,359
in working with the nccoe the national

964
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,440
cyber security of excellence

965
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,760
we also have a project that's focusing

966
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,839
on the transition and migration to pqc

967
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,640
so this product is being run by uh some

968
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,200
of our colleagues in the nccoe um but

969
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,640
we're participating with them in this

970
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,880
process they've held a workshop

971
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,200
they finalized their pro projects you

972
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,280
can go to their website

973
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,599
most recently they announced a or they

974
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,560
published a federal register notice

975
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,560
where you can join the the project and

976
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,800
participate in this process so i'd

977
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,480
encourage you to

978
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,079
go to the project webpage if you're

979
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,680
interested in learning

980
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,640
they also have white papers on how an

981
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,800
organization can start preparing for

982
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,040
this transition and this is an important

983
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,599
effort to help us get ready

984
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,920
what we can do now before the standards

985
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,599
are announced and before the final

986
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,160
standard is published

987
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,720
okay next slide

988
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,920
these are some of the things that

989
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,040
organizations can do now

990
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,880
it mostly involves taking a look at the

991
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,119
cryptography you're using now

992
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,800
seeing what public key algorithms you

993
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,560
have

994
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,440
looking at how you can transition out of

995
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,440
them how you can swap in new algorithms

996
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,800
that's often called crypto agility

997
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,400
and then just making sure that you're

998
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,839
you're making

999
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,000
your staff is aware of this you've got

1000
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,960
someone tasked with having a plan for

1001
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,640
making the transition to post quantum

1002
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,839
algorithms

1003
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,760
and tracking developments in quantum

1004
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,400
computers in standardization projects

1005
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,760
you could test out some of these

1006
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,599
algorithms to see how will they meet how

1007
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,079
they fit in your applications

1008
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,920
but we'd encourage you the sooner you

1009
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,920
plan ahead and prepare the better it

1010
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,599
will be for you you'll you'll make less

1011
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,680
mistakes it'll be less disruptive less

1012
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,799
expensive as you do that

1013
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,800
so next slide

1014
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,720
so in conclusion we're getting near to

1015
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,240
the end of the the third round we can

1016
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,520
start to see the light at the end of the

1017
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,480
tunnel

1018
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,480
nist is grateful for everybody's efforts

1019
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,880
the cryptographic community researchers

1020
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,320
industry who's tested out these

1021
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,520
algorithms

1022
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,440
other standards organizations who are

1023
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,240
working as well to to help create strong

1024
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,359
post-quantum crypto standards

1025
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,800
and we'd encourage you to check out our

1026
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,560
web page sign up for the forum if you

1027
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,880
haven't yet and you can always contact

1028
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,040
us directly if you need to

1029
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,960
so with that i'd be happy to take any

1030
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,560
questions that you have about our

1031
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,960
project

1032
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,520
john please

1033
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,240
um how many changes or how little

1034
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,200
changes can we expect from now until the

1035
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,760
final standards already hopefully in

1036
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,079
2024

1037
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,480
which is like two three years from now

1038
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,240
um okay

1039
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,960
yeah so at the end of each round uh we

1040
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,560
allowed each of the algorithms that

1041
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,160
advanced on to make

1042
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,040
minor tweaks not major redesign

1043
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,880
so we expected at the end of the third

1044
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,839
round

1045
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,000
you know if we select an algorithm we

1046
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,760
would work with the team and allow them

1047
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,599
to make any minor tweaks from things

1048
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,000
they learned during the third rounds but

1049
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,880
nothing major no no big redesigns so i

1050
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,040
would say that the type of changes

1051
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,880
would be similar to what you saw at the

1052
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,800
end of each round when teams made tweaks

1053
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,040
watson i think you're up next

1054
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,520
mad cover um

1055
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,839
so one of the things that happened with

1056
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,599
elliptic curve photography is there was

1057
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,079
a very long gap

1058
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,680
between

1059
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,200
new standardization and adoption

1060
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,000
and that was partially due to ipr

1061
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,599
concerns

1062
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,520
and and some operating systems really

1063
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,200
didn't have

1064
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,880
any support for quite a long time

1065
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,960
because of these ipr concerns

1066
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,040
as well as performance issues and then

1067
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,200
when further developments resolve those

1068
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,680
performance issues this didn't respond

1069
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,200
and it's not until

1070
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,760
two years really that nist has said that

1071
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,520
oh yeah we can do that we are going to

1072
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,839
standardize faster with the curves

1073
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,320
and my concern is has this is with post

1074
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,480
quantum where we have

1075
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,240
possibilities especially in signatures

1076
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,240
of faster and better algorithms coming

1077
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,200
out

1078
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,440
is this going to be more responsive or

1079
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,720
is it going to be a situation where

1080
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,400
we're going to be stuck for a while with

1081
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,599
things that

1082
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,839
maybe we can't do everywhere and really

1083
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:30,960
need to

1084
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,920
because nist isn't isn't paying

1085
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,359
attention anymore to what's going on

1086
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,880
they say okay we've got the got the

1087
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,680
spectrum we're done

1088
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,240
we expect our post quantum work to

1089
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,680
continue on

1090
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,599
into the future at the end of the third

1091
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,040
round we're announcing these algorithms

1092
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,119
we will get a first standard out

1093
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,960
but the project will continue on there's

1094
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,480
going to be a fourth round there's going

1095
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,280
to be the on-ramp for signatures

1096
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,920
um so to the best of my knowledge yes we

1097
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,680
will be

1098
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,680
we will be looking for

1099
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,319
the future research and being proactive

1100
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,160
and if we need to

1101
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,000
you know make changes or standardize new

1102
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,839
things that we would be responsive

1103
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,720
i feel good

1104
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,560
yeah

1105
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,040
great talk

1106
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,000
i've got to ask about threshold

1107
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,079
um

1108
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,920
can any of these be adapted to a

1109
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,880
threshold version

1110
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,160
um

1111
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,960
it's possible that some of them could

1112
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,800
as they currently are in the specs right

1113
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,640
now i'm not aware that any of them have

1114
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,359
a

1115
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,599
threshold implementation

1116
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,800
um

1117
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,079
and that's not our

1118
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,319
our primary focus we first want to just

1119
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,119
get

1120
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,880
an algorithm standardized so that people

1121
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,520
will have it begin to get using and

1122
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,960
and that could be future work where

1123
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,400
there could be threshold versions of

1124
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,680
these done

1125
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,440
are any of them particularly suited

1126
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,440
where they be able to they look like

1127
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,480
they could allow that

1128
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,680
some of the lattice-based ones

1129
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,880
potentially

1130
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,079
i think uh

1131
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,440
if i'm remembering lima was a

1132
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,200
first-round ladder space candidate and

1133
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,520
it talked about how it could be

1134
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,480
done in a threshold way potentially

1135
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,119
so that would be where i would guess is

1136
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,720
a lot of space ones might have the

1137
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,400
easiest way to do that but i'm not

1138
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,040
currently aware that anyone has has done

1139
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,440
it yet

1140
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,280
okay

1141
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,560
ecker you're at the top of the queue

1142
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,160
yeah thanks thanks for talking

1143
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,440
appreciated um so um i noticed that i

1144
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,040
noticed that uh you're standardizing

1145
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,599
chems and um but a lot of our protocols

1146
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,839
really want nike instead um so um i know

1147
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,040
there's sort of a dearth of algorithms

1148
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,160
there but is this planning to do

1149
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,280
anything to try to like foster that work

1150
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,720
well back at the beginning when we were

1151
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,079
first starting this project that's what

1152
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,920
we were hoping for was kind of a direct

1153
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,400
analog of the diffie-hellman um

1154
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,000
looking at the submissions that came in

1155
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,319
there was none that really provided that

1156
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,000
at the time

1157
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,839
i think there have been some ideas that

1158
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:14,880
are out there right now that could

1159
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,599
potentially do that

1160
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,480
but i think our feeling is we think that

1161
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,359
you can use the chems and you can

1162
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,680
modify them to to get what you need done

1163
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,920
still if we do see

1164
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,359
a really good one coming in in the

1165
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,200
future we could work on that but we

1166
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,400
don't have any current plans at the

1167
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,960
moment to focus on that

1168
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,560
oh okay it is true you can use the

1169
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,520
chemist for that but it is not

1170
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,800
convenient so it would much more

1171
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,000
convenient doesn't it that looks like it

1172
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,760
looked much more like to filming

1173
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,839
yep we understand yeah

1174
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,680
hi uh i i guess partly repeating what

1175
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,000
said earlier i mean encumbered outcomes

1176
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,599
would be a really bad outcome i think

1177
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,599
for this um i know you can't control

1178
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,359
that also though i think the thing you

1179
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,760
can control are the number of options um

1180
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,560
so

1181
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,240
i know that you're you're not liable to

1182
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,839
pick one single algorithm to declare a

1183
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,240
winner but i hope for each algorithm you

1184
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,640
don't declare 75 different options

1185
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,640
and then that would cause a lot of work

1186
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,319
in an organization like the itf where

1187
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,079
people then have to decide

1188
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,839
which of the 15 options that they winnow

1189
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,240
down to 10 and then to one and so on so

1190
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,240
i'd encourage you to extend possible to

1191
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,160
reduce the number of outcomes to the

1192
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,720
absolute minimum you can

1193
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,319
thank you for that suggestion yeah we've

1194
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,079
we've heard that feedback from industry

1195
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,319
as well and that's something we we plan

1196
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,400
on doing we will standardize more than

1197
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,000
one but we want to keep it as small as

1198
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,560
possible yes

1199
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,480
hi

1200
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,200
uh ben schwartz of google

1201
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,160
i

1202
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,440
uh i wanted to ask if

1203
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,079
you uh and and the the whole group at

1204
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,720
nist had given much thought

1205
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,160
to

1206
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,560
combine schemes that that combined one

1207
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,599
of these

1208
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,359
uh one of these signature algorithms

1209
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,440
with a

1210
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,480
with a merkle algorithm

1211
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,680
to uh to amortize the signing costs

1212
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,720
there's a draft in the tls working group

1213
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,839
right now adopted draft on batch signing

1214
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,280
using merkle trees

1215
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,119
to to share the cost of a signature

1216
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,599
across a large number of handshakes i

1217
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,599
wonder if that influences any of your

1218
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,200
thinking

1219
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,119
yeah that that would fall into our third

1220
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,560
evaluation criteria kind of the

1221
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,640
algorithm and implementation

1222
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,160
specifics

1223
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,000
yeah we are aware of kind of research

1224
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,680
being done in that way and if an

1225
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,240
algorithm allows for

1226
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,480
you know batch signing in a particularly

1227
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,680
efficient way

1228
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,560
that would be a plus for it so we do try

1229
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,480
and be aware of that and

1230
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,160
factor it in when we're we're going to

1231
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,319
select something yes

1232
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,160
okay yeah just because in general it

1233
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,319
seems like slow signature schemes with

1234
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,880
small signatures um could easily be

1235
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,800
combined but sort of trivially with the

1236
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,359
with the old-fashioned merkle signature

1237
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,160
trees for in that situation

1238
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,319
yep and that would be a good way to get

1239
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:15,599
some algorithms that might be a little

1240
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,359
more cumbersome to be able to be used

1241
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,040
yes

1242
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,079
okay great thanks

1243
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,440
hi uh ben kadek so there was a topic

1244
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,359
that came up in the chat a couple times

1245
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,720
about uh sort of key sizes

1246
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,079
and um

1247
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,480
i know you had i think a little bit of

1248
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,960
of data in the charts about key sizes

1249
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,400
but like

1250
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,440
is there

1251
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,400
some

1252
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,000
minimum expansion factor that we're

1253
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,760
going to hit when

1254
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,000
in key size when we go to the post

1255
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,880
quantum algorithms

1256
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,240
well

1257
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,040
the main ones the finalists that we're

1258
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,319
looking at right now the structured

1259
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,400
lattice ones for chems they're roughly

1260
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,560
about for category one a thousand bytes

1261
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,400
that's

1262
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,160
the smallest we're seeing for good

1263
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,079
general purpose algorithms psyc does

1264
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,079
have smaller keys that are

1265
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,920
a couple hundred bytes but then its

1266
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,839
performance is an order of magnitude

1267
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,119
slower

1268
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,920
i'm looking at the signatures falcon is

1269
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,560
smaller than dilithium for sure

1270
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,160
it's less than a thousand bytes die

1271
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,720
lithium's more like

1272
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,560
1500 2 000 bytes for category one so

1273
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,280
based on what we have that's

1274
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,359
the best we can kind of do coming out of

1275
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,359
round three at this point

1276
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:36,079
sure

1277
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,520
are we going to have to take what we can

1278
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,400
get at these tips

1279
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:44,000
thanks and i guess mike you are next to

1280
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,480
the cube

1281
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,599
i remember at the

1282
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,079
florida iteration of this conference

1283
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,000
there was a proposal around hybrid

1284
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,240
schemes it was sort of flippant but the

1285
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,319
proposal was we were able to achieve a

1286
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,680
security level by combining two smaller

1287
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,400
faster things into a single primitive

1288
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,240
do you remember that idea floating has

1289
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,480
there been any any traction like did

1290
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,720
that idea die i know it was a joke but

1291
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,359
it sort of seemed maybe worth pursuing

1292
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,480
um i don't remember that from the

1293
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,120
florida workshop um

1294
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,440
[Music]

1295
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,680
so i'm not remembering it which makes me

1296
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,520
think there i mean maybe there's been

1297
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,040
some efforts in that direction but i'm

1298
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,480
not aware of them so

1299
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,839
i don't know

1300
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,359
okay so that's the that's the end of the

1301
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,119
queue is are there any other questions

1302
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,920
for dustin

1303
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,520
i am not seeing anyone join so justin a

1304
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,440
profound kind of thank you for for

1305
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,599
joining us and giving us an update for

1306
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,200
what nist is doing this is kind of such

1307
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,359
an important kind of activity for our

1308
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,640
future roadmap so uh so again we if we

1309
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,000
have any other questions we may kind of

1310
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,520
follow up with you but again kind of

1311
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,040
thanks thanks so much and have a good

1312
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,400
rest of your day

1313
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,200
okay thank you

1314
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,760
all right so we have ended early we have

1315
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,160
about 10 minutes officially uh kind of

1316
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,680
on the schedule before we pivot to sec

1317
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,960
dispatch so

1318
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,520
opening the mic uh kind of open mic for

1319
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,079
sag topics and if we

1320
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,400
after we drain that cue we'll just gonna

1321
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,000
pivot on to starting with the sec

1322
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,160
dispatch meeting

1323
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,000
would anyone like to join the queue for

1324
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,960
open mic sag

1325
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,920
florence please

1326
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,160
hi um flo from uk ncsc um i was

1327
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,359
wondering kind of picking up on

1328
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,839
something we discussed at the last sag

1329
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:04,960
meeting

1330
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,359
um there was some chat around

1331
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,119
um kind of coordination of post quantum

1332
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,119
work in the itf

1333
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,839
um and it seems on the mailing list that

1334
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,520
that's kind of been

1335
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,040
turned into the discussion around the pq

1336
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,200
maintenance group which sounds great

1337
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,640
um but i was wondering if there's any

1338
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,880
plan for coordinating the post quantum

1339
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,119
work between different groups um so the

1340
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:26,640
stuff that's going on in yeah different

1341
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,280
working groups

1342
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,280
uh i i would say from at least kind of

1343
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,160
the ad perspective we are just

1344
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,319
informally doing that formal class of

1345
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,040
kind of coordination if we end up with a

1346
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,640
working group to do that we would hope

1347
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,960
that that entity would roughly kind of

1348
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,880
take the lead so

1349
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,640
that class of coordination is kind of on

1350
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,079
you know in the kind of thinking but

1351
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,440
right now this is roughly just

1352
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,680
informally done the three places at

1353
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,440
least in sec that we have actively

1354
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,280
chartered items are lamps tls and ipsec

1355
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,079
i'm sure more work is needed

1356
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:02,960
so

1357
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,040
do you think some of that coordination

1358
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,040
could end up taking place in the kind of

1359
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,319
pq agility pq maintenance group or is

1360
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,880
that not on the cards for that group

1361
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,800
thank you i i think that's up to what

1362
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,400
the community actually wants uh the way

1363
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,440
that post quantum that that particular

1364
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,599
charter that particular thing we're

1365
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:24,800
having on the mailing list kind of

1366
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,040
talking about uh the that agility work

1367
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,319
group is largely to catch orphans so

1368
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,319
it's focused on what are protocols we

1369
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,000
may need to touch that don't have

1370
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,839
existing working groups

1371
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,920
uh so if there is existing work for

1372
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,240
example kind of in tls or kind of ipsec

1373
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,760
it's probably going to be handled out of

1374
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,599
that working group which is not to say

1375
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,040
you know the topic can't be coordinated

1376
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,880
but that work is likely going to be in

1377
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,960
that working group at least as the text

1378
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,880
is currently written the other thing

1379
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,040
that that working group that that kind

1380
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,319
of proposed kind of template working

1381
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:55,440
group that we're talking about might

1382
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,119
have is the ability to kind of generally

1383
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,880
talk about things before that we know

1384
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,559
some organic coordination baked in there

1385
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,559
yes

1386
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,720
thank you

1387
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,839

00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,720
here so you have already seen the note

1418
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,920
well once and it still applies

1419
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,000
it hasn't changed you're still in an

1420
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,160
iedf meeting

1421
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,079
hopefully you're familiar with most of

1422
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,920
the bcps but

1423
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,880
if not

1424
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,400
you can have a look at them they are

1425
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,359
listed here on the slide please

1426
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,440
yeah go go and have a look at them is

1427
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,079
it's anyways good to refresh your memory

1428
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,480
once in a while

1429
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,119
uh perhaps we would like to emphasize

1430
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:25,599
the idf code of conduct still applies so

1431
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,520
you just saw this when roman was

1432
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,800
presenting the slides earlier but again

1433
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,000
to

1434
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,400
re-emphasize

1435
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,359
have a look at rfc 7154

1436
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,480
please

1437
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,040
respect your colleagues and

1438
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,920
try to be as impersonal as possible in

1439
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,599
discussions

1440
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,480
and

1441
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,240
yeah we are trying to make the internet

1442
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,720
better so let's be

1443
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,480
good to each other while we do that

1444
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,319
uh so this session is being recorded uh

1445
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,800
if you were not aware of it so far you

1446
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,720
have you were being recorded in the last

1447
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,079
one hour and

1448
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,119
you will continue to be uh recorded for

1449
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,079
about

1450
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,680
uh a little over the next hour as well

1451
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,760
and headsets are recommended

1452
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,400
state your name before you speak in the

1453
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,040
mic queue

1454
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,240
all right

1455
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,000
here's some links

1456
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:22,800
so

1457
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,160
very importantly we'll be using the

1458
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,280
notes dot idf.org for notes and we'll be

1459
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,680
using the sec dispatch link

1460
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,359
not the sag

1461
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:34,880
link

1462
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,839
i think

1463
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,960
my co-chairs will manage

1464
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,799
the jabber

1465
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:45,200
but we will need note takers so i wonder

1466
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,200
if we have someone helping with the

1467
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,520
notes already

1468
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:57,599
oh i see

1469
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:59,520
at least for suck someone was taking

1470
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,520
notes probably roman but it would be

1471
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,599
nice if someone can take notes for sex

1472
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,359
dispatch as well

1473
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:08,799
do we have any volunteers

1474
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,359
i don't see anyone on

1475
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:18,759
on the chat

1476
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,599
i would love to but i think i'll be

1477
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,640
switching slides from here and managing

1478
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,440
other things so okay uh thanks uh

1479
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,200
jonathan so we'll have note takers

1480
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,160
with that sorted out before we get

1481
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,280
to

1482
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,319
the actual agenda here's a

1483
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:44,880
quick reminder of uh what is sex

1484
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,880
dispatch and what do we do so sec

1485
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,200
dispatch is mostly for recommending the

1486
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,680
next steps for new work it does not

1487
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,920
adopt crafts

1488
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,000
we could direct the new work to an

1489
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,839
existing working group

1490
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:00,000
we could suggest

1491
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,160
a new working group whether that is

1492
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,280
through a buff or not depends on

1493
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,839
the ads we could also ask our ads to

1494
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:09,839
sponsor some documents

1495
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,040
or

1496
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,040
then come to the conclusion that ietf

1497
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,799
should not work on a particular topic

1498
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,119
uh

1499
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:20,799
yeah hopefully you're familiar with

1500
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,160
these buttons

1501
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,839
by now i don't think we need to spend

1502
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,559
much time on on this slide

1503
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:30,480
uh fi so before we get to the agenda

1504
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,640
for sex dispatch there was a draft

1505
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,839
presented on secure credential transfer

1506
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,200
in the dispatch uh session earlier this

1507
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,040
week so yesterday there was a draft on

1508
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,000
secure credential transfer there was

1509
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
presented and

1510
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,319
the outcome is on the dispatch uh

1511
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,160
mailing list kirsty has

1512
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,000
thankfully

1513
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
given us a heads up so that we can also

1514
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,319
inform the security community in in this

1515
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,720
meeting in insect dispatch

1516
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,920
uh

1517
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,760
the full outcome is on the mailing list

1518
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,400
but i anu is uh

1519
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,240
wanted to provide a heads up that there

1520
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,799
will probably be a buff at least there

1521
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:10,839
was consensus in the dispatch working

1522
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:12,880
group to

1523
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,280
to initiate a buff on this topic and i'm

1524
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,760
sure like this is of interest to to many

1525
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,599
of those who are in attending the sect

1526
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:20,960
dispatch so

1527
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,040
do have a look follow

1528
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,760
what's going on and we might have a buff

1529
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,720
before or during the next ietf

1530
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,000
in 2022.

1531
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,160
with that uh we are now at the

1532
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,079
agenda for this session uh thankfully we

1533
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:42,240
managed to finish the

1534
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,200
administration before the hour so we are

1535
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,799
in in good time

1536
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:49,280
uh we'll have a presentation from tommy

1537
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,599
on private access tokens uh another

1538
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,599
presentation on security and privacy

1539
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:55,839
considerations for multicast transports

1540
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,240
from jake and then we'll

1541
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,079
one of the chairs will summarize the

1542
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,799
outcomes at the end of the session

1543
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:05,200
uh we already have jonathan

1544
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,119
again thanks for helping us with the

1545
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,720
notes we have scribes in place is there

1546
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,879
anyone who would like to bash the agenda

1547
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,799
if

1548
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,520
not in that case i'll

1549
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,400
share

1550
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,160
your slides to me

1551
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,760
yeah actually if i could share my own

1552
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,000
slides i can just ask to do that that

1553
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,240
would be great yeah yeah that's fine

1554
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,760
that's fine

1555
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,920
and then as a minor agenda bash you know

1556
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,200
i know that there also is time on

1557
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,760
thursday so i guess if you know if we're

1558
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,839
having discussion

1559
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:43,119
i assume we have you know probably a

1560
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,599
little bit more than 25 minutes for each

1561
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,040
of these talks that we could probably go

1562
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,400
into

1563
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,720
sure

1564
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,920
all right

1565
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,079
i'm asking to share slides if you could

1566
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,640
approve that

1567
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,440
thank you

1568
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,920
all right good morning good afternoon

1569
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,359
everyone

1570
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:08,319
um

1571
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:10,079
so i'm tommy pauley and i'm going to be

1572
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,480
presenting on behalf of uh several

1573
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,160
co-authors i have here um i'm from apple

1574
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,200
i'm also

1575
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,839
working on this document with chris wood

1576
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,319
who's at cloudflare johnny yangar from

1577
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:23,520
fastly

1578
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,440
and stephen valdez and scott hendrickson

1579
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,160
who are at google and this is a document

1580
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,520
that we are calling private access

1581
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,400
tokens i sent it out to the list

1582
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,240
a little bit ago

1583
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,480
as we publish on the day of the deadline

1584
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,240
but we want to share that with you here

1585
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,799
and see what the next step for this type

1586
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,520
of work is

1587
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,839
all right

1588
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:47,040
so just to give you an idea of what we

1589
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,799
want to go through

1590
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:49,599
first we're going to talk about the

1591
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,359
motivation for why we think this is

1592
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:52,960
important work to do we're going to

1593
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,400
briefly go over what the protocol

1594
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,480
architecture is without diving into all

1595
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,160
of the details if you want to see that

1596
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,319
read the document

1597
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:01,359
and then lastly talk about some

1598
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:03,119
deployment considerations before we get

1599
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:06,319
on to the dispatching questions

1600
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:08,240
all right let's go

1601
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,440
what problem are we trying to solve here

1602
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,480
okay so let's tell a little story

1603
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,319
so servers

1604
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:18,559
as we know often use client ip addresses

1605
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,480
as an identification mechanism and this

1606
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,720
is because clients generally just tell

1607
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,280
them hey when i'm connecting to you

1608
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,000
here's my ip address you can know who i

1609
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,280
am

1610
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,119
and this is useful

1611
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:32,640
and amongst other things servers can

1612
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,359
recognize these addresses over time

1613
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:37,280
and some of these are useful features

1614
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,880
like they can use it to rate limit

1615
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,319
access to some

1616
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,599
particular resource when that's

1617
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,799
appropriate

1618
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:44,240
and the origin can say oh yeah this is

1619
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,480
the fifth time i've seen you today or

1620
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,839
this week

1621
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:50,400
um sometimes that's a good thing

1622
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,359
for example um there are services that

1623
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,280
want to be able to have oh here's a

1624
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,040
metered paywall of you get seven free

1625
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,040
articles and if i can see this you get

1626
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,280
the free articles

1627
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,640
i'd like to point out that it's kind of

1628
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,280
hilarious that wikipedia for their

1629
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,200
metered paywall site had to come up with

1630
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,558
an entirely fake newspaper here

1631
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:13,440
now there are problems

1632
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,119
many problems with using ips for

1633
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,599
tracking like this

1634
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:20,000
even if you think this is a

1635
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,119
kind of a valuable thing to do

1636
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:25,119
you have issues where multiple clients

1637
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,040
can be behind the same ip address quite

1638
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,119
often and you essentially are sharing

1639
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:30,880
fate with everyone who's at your house

1640
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,960
or at the cafe you're at um you can hit

1641
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,079
limits but

1642
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,079
worse than that being able to track the

1643
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:37,920
ip address over time

1644
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,000
is a privacy violation and it's a

1645
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,079
tracking vector often

1646
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:43,040
so

1647
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,240
there are a lot of great privacy

1648
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,960
services vpns tor

1649
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,520
and at apple recently we've released our

1650
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,040
private relay service which has two

1651
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,960
proxies in between your client traffic

1652
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,280
and it's all about trying to improve

1653
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,640
client privacy by having your client

1654
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,079
identification be something that's

1655
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:02,319
explicit and not just passively gathered

1656
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:05,119
up by looking your ip addresses

1657
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:08,160
but as you'll note

1658
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,760
this does take away some of the

1659
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,160
capabilities of origins to do

1660
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,480
correct rate limiting um

1661
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,200
or

1662
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,680
you know any type of inference of client

1663
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,119
state

1664
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:21,440
because they don't know the ip address

1665
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,799
anymore they don't know how to do this

1666
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:24,240
and this is what the entire ecosystem

1667
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,760
was built upon for a lot of things

1668
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,000
so private access tokens is about you

1669
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,520
know figuring out how do we let things

1670
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,160
like rate limits work regardless of ip

1671
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,240
address but we don't want to do this by

1672
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,160
introducing a new stable identifier

1673
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,359
that's going to hurt privacy we want

1674
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,119
something that is privacy preserving but

1675
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:42,319
lets you

1676
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:43,920
prove something about your access

1677
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,039
patterns

1678
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,039
and so where is this useful it's

1679
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,359
certainly not for everything um

1680
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,440
this is about cases where you have

1681
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,440
anonymous access

1682
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,039
that you want to be able to prove some

1683
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:56,720
limited client state

1684
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,319
to do things like per

1685
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:00,400
origin rate limiting and this is not for

1686
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,760
any case where you're going to log in

1687
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,720
anyway

1688
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,480
that's a much stronger identity and that

1689
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,359
should be solved elsewhere

1690
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:08,640
and help us think about this i want to

1691
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,640
split kind of the world into three

1692
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,960
categories here

1693
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,039
all you on one hand in this green box on

1694
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:16,880
the left we have

1695
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,799
you know things are truly anonymous

1696
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,799
access that don't need any state they

1697
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:22,640
don't it's inappropriate for them to

1698
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,559
have any client

1699
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:25,520
um

1700
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,359
identifiers i just want to be able to

1701
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:28,960
read a wikipedia article i just want to

1702
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,839
use the search engine public resources

1703
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,520
no need to

1704
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,680
track me on that

1705
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,680
on the right side in the orange box we

1706
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,280
have things that legitimately should

1707
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,119
have authenticated access

1708
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:42,799
if i'm going to upload something to my

1709
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:44,319
own social media account you should

1710
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:45,680
probably know who i am and i should

1711
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,520
probably log in

1712
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,880
um so the question is you know there's

1713
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,280
this category in the middle which is

1714
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,640
something where i'm coming in with an

1715
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,720
anonymous access i haven't logged into

1716
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,839
anything

1717
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:58,799
but you do want still some

1718
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:00,400
minimal per client states such as rate

1719
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,720
limiting um as we mentioned before this

1720
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,920
can be

1721
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,000
accessing some

1722
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,480
being a bit more privileged

1723
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,079
resource like being able to read a

1724
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,680
newspaper article

1725
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,280
that otherwise would require you to pay

1726
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,559
but they're trying to let you see some

1727
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,720
things but also this account this

1728
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,720
applies for account

1729
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,559
creation where something wants to make

1730
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:22,240
sure that you're not

1731
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,680
having

1732
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,520
a thousand different accesses from a bot

1733
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,039
trying to create a thousand new accounts

1734
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:30,400
or even um if i'm doing log into a site

1735
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,160
where i'm anonymous before because i

1736
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,480
haven't logged in yet

1737
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,960
um a failed login is something that you

1738
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,720
probably want to rate limit so that

1739
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,720
someone's not just trying to brute force

1740
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,400
a password in

1741
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,760
and so these are cases that have been

1742
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,680
built up around doing ip address rate

1743
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,280
limiting today

1744
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,319
they

1745
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,079
exist and they're going to need to do

1746
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:51,520
something as

1747
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,680
connections get more and more private

1748
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,359
and the concern is that if there is not

1749
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:58,799
a good privacy preserving solution

1750
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:00,240
use cases that are in that middle box

1751
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,599
are going to have to move to one side or

1752
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:03,520
the other

1753
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,960
either they're going to say great we're

1754
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,880
just going to go totally open and that's

1755
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,359
fine but we're concerned that they're

1756
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:10,799
going to be more things also that would

1757
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:13,359
move more towards the right to say okay

1758
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:15,599
if you want to read this now you need to

1759
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,880
sign in with this major social media

1760
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,640
network to be able to get into something

1761
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,160
or hey if you want to create an account

1762
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,000
with us or log in you need to bootstrap

1763
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,760
it with some other account of some major

1764
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,520
service that we trust and that's going

1765
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,160
to be worse and worse for privacy

1766
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,680
so we think that there is a need to

1767
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,160
solve this

1768
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,520
and private access tokens is about

1769
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,359
solving this case

1770
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:38,799
essentially it allows the client to

1771
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:41,200
prove to an origin that is performed

1772
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,359
fewer than n accesses in a time window

1773
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:46,160
and that's all it's going to prove

1774
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,760
and the key thing that we have as a

1775
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,440
requirement in here

1776
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,119
is we want to make sure that no entity

1777
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:53,200
in the system can correlate user

1778
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,799
identity with their browsing history

1779
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:56,640
because of this

1780
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,160
all right

1781
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,720
so how does the protocol work

1782
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,400
there are two parts to it there's a

1783
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,720
token challenge request and then there

1784
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,640
is an issuance protocol

1785
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,640
so the challenging request quite simple

1786
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,480
um what we're proposing here is just

1787
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,680
have a new

1788
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,920
http authentication method you get a

1789
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,280
challenge

1790
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,480
um is actually asking the client hey you

1791
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,760
know you're trying to do some privileged

1792
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,119
operation you're trying to create a new

1793
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:22,799
account um

1794
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:24,640
you're trying to read the newspaper

1795
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,119
article you need a token to get this or

1796
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,039
i'll otherwise you know you'll fall back

1797
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:30,720
to something like getting the captcha or

1798
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,720
having to do some other type of proof

1799
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:37,280
so the oregon origins can challenge for

1800
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,839
this um and then the clients will

1801
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:42,400
asynchronously fetch an unlinkable token

1802
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,079
that's specific to that origin and then

1803
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:46,240
present it and then the origin can

1804
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,160
validate that without having to do any

1805
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,920
more work this is a public verifiable

1806
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,280
thing

1807
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:54,000
so how do we actually get to the tokens

1808
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,760
so in order to go through this

1809
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,079
i want to kind of build up

1810
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:00,240
why we have the architecture we do based

1811
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,079
on showing you kind of process of

1812
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:03,920
elimination that you can't do

1813
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,000
some other architectures

1814
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,760
you know clearly we're not going to be

1815
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,200
able to just

1816
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,680
fetch the token from the origin itself

1817
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:12,720
because

1818
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,119
kind of by definition in the assumptions

1819
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:17,440
here we either don't want to log into

1820
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,359
this origin provided a real identity so

1821
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:21,520
it can track us or we can't because we

1822
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,200
don't have an account yet

1823
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,720
so that's not a good option

1824
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,799
so we could bootstrap off of something

1825
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,599
that you could call like a token issuer

1826
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,280
and you know you could imagine i could

1827
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,920
have some issuer that

1828
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,000
can validate me can know that i'm a real

1829
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,559
device or have an account that i have

1830
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:42,559
and then on my behalf

1831
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,480
get a token for that origin that i can

1832
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,319
then present to the origin i want to go

1833
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:47,599
to

1834
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,599
and this would you know technically work

1835
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:50,960
however

1836
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,799
um you know this doesn't meet the goals

1837
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:54,799
we have for privacy because this issuer

1838
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:56,799
would be in too privileged of a position

1839
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,640
because it would be able to identify the

1840
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,240
clients and track their state

1841
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,680
potentially

1842
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,760
as well as knowing all the origins that

1843
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,960
they're going to

1844
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,079
and this would allow them to learn the

1845
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:07,760
browsing history and be a bad privacy

1846
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,480
story

1847
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,240
all right so we end up with a bit more

1848
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,599
split model

1849
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:16,479
um if you've gone to oblivious http this

1850
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:18,238
type of split is not

1851
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:20,719
the first time you've seen this

1852
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:21,920
so

1853
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,679
the model that we're proposing here is

1854
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,640
that you have a separated mediator and

1855
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,080
an issuer and a mediator is something

1856
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,560
that's chosen by a client that is able

1857
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,679
to

1858
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,359
authenticate the client and validate who

1859
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,040
the client is but is not able to see

1860
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,960
what they're trying to access

1861
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,560
but it helps just kind of mediate this

1862
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,719
entire transaction and

1863
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:43,198
represent their validity

1864
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:45,198
it will forward blinded requests for

1865
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:47,120
tokens to an issuer

1866
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,600
issuers are chosen by origins

1867
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,759
as entities that can vend out tokens on

1868
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:53,120
their behalf

1869
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,920
and enforce the policies that they want

1870
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,238
such as you get

1871
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:01,279
no more than 100 tokens per hour or even

1872
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,319
five tokens per week

1873
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:07,679
so overall the the protocol looks like

1874
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,080
you have this end-to-end challenge and

1875
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,520
response between the client and the

1876
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,479
origin

1877
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:14,319
and in between you can have these little

1878
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:16,719
loops between the client mediator and

1879
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:21,000
issuer to actually grab new tokens

1880
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:24,799
now the clients

1881
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:26,560
never tell the mediator what the actual

1882
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,120
origin name is they only tell

1883
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,439
some pseudonym an anonymous origin

1884
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:33,759
the actual origin name is encrypted from

1885
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:36,319
the client to the issuers

1886
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,238
the mediators are responsible for

1887
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:41,120
keeping a count of tokens that are

1888
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,120
issued to each client

1889
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,120
for a specific anonymous origin within a

1890
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,120
window and the window is something that

1891
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,640
the issuer can define

1892
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,799
to essentially say hey i care about rate

1893
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,880
limiting things within an hour like you

1894
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,440
could only try to create an account five

1895
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,120
times in an hour or you can only have

1896
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:00,239
five failed logins in an hour

1897
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:03,520
and that policy window is given back

1898
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,400
um

1899
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,679
it's told to the meteor to help the

1900
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,880
whole system work like this

1901
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,920
there are um i just want to briefly

1902
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,040
mention some of the cryptographic

1903
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,400
dependencies that we have for the

1904
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,520
protocol

1905
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,560
for the origins it's very very simple

1906
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,120
they just have to do a verification

1907
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,280
of an rsa blind signature token they

1908
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,719
don't have to

1909
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:26,640
do any double spend prevention they can

1910
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,440
just validate that the token looks good

1911
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,239
on the issuance side

1912
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:33,760
the system of the client media and

1913
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,679
issuer do need to do a bit more work

1914
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:37,760
they use rsa bind signatures for the

1915
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,920
tokens themselves

1916
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,239
the client uses hpke

1917
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:43,600
to encrypt

1918
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,920
the actual origin name

1919
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,920
to the issuer

1920
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,239
and then the system also uses

1921
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:52,640
a blind it diffie-hellman with a schnorr

1922
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,239
proof of knowledge

1923
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:55,199
to

1924
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:57,760
help the mediator prove that the client

1925
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,520
is not lying about the mapping between

1926
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,760
its anonymous origin

1927
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,239
and the actual origin name chris will be

1928
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:06,159
talking about that in cfrg for the

1929
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:09,679
crypto details if you're interested

1930
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,960
all right so we've talked about

1931
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,880
why we think this is important to solve

1932
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,320
we've talked about what the basic

1933
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,760
architecture is

1934
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,440
but um the last thing i want to hit on

1935
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,480
which is i think one of the most

1936
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,480
interesting parts is the kind of

1937
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,280
deployment model

1938
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,360
so i mentioned some of this already but

1939
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,360
the clients are responsible for choosing

1940
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,360
their trusted mediators these are people

1941
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,360
who are they're willing to

1942
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,920
um log in with or who have some notion

1943
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,920
of client identity anyway

1944
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,040
that they know isn't going to learn

1945
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,320
about their browsing history but can

1946
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,520
help them

1947
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,679
as they want to get tokens

1948
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,360
and this could be based on a number of

1949
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,040
different things that's not specified in

1950
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,480
the document it could be based on a

1951
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,920
device level

1952
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,840
built-in hardware assert

1953
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,560
it could be some verified account

1954
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,920
that you have with a service some

1955
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,400
two-factor thing

1956
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,239
origins are responsible for choosing

1957
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:02,080
trusted issuers

1958
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:03,679
and one of the assumptions of the

1959
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:05,679
architecture is that each issuer should

1960
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:07,840
be serving multiple origins and that's

1961
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,920
required so that the mediator doesn't

1962
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,679
learn based on going into an issue or

1963
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:15,120
exactly what website you're going to

1964
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,600
and this would work really well for

1965
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,000
issuers to be existing cvns or web

1966
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,600
hosting services or any kind of security

1967
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,000
capture service that you have

1968
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,840
it could be a number of different things

1969
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:28,560
but

1970
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,920
different entities that would be

1971
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,560
representing origins

1972
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,719
and then the system does rely on the

1973
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:36,159
fact that there needs to be some level

1974
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:38,000
of mutual trust

1975
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,239
between the entities running mediators

1976
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:42,159
and entities running issuers

1977
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:43,679
for privacy reasons they should be

1978
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:45,600
different entities and the client

1979
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,120
can essentially

1980
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:47,920
you know

1981
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,679
do some level of knowledge because they

1982
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:51,040
are choosing what media they go through

1983
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,320
that it's not the same thing as the

1984
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,000
origin that they're going to or the

1985
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,400
issuer that they're using

1986
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,840
but

1987
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,840
um if trust does break down if meteors

1988
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,040
start

1989
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,719
lying or doing

1990
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,560
letting clients get away with too much

1991
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,520
then

1992
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,080
you could imagine that there wouldn't um

1993
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,679
be good support between mediators and

1994
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:11,760
issuers so they do need to live up to a

1995
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,480
certain standard

1996
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:17,679
so one way to look at the architecture

1997
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:19,600
is that you have many different clients

1998
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,000
behind single mediators many different

1999
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,400
origins behind single issuers and that

2000
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,400
is kind of what preserves and protects

2001
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,480
the identities

2002
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,520
of

2003
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,760
clients and origins from the other

2004
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,199
parties in the system so that there's no

2005
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:35,839
tracking here

2006
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,640
um briefly talking about client identity

2007
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,679
um

2008
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:43,120
you know this is something that is

2009
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:46,719
determined by the mediator really um the

2010
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:48,719
private access tokens architecture does

2011
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:50,480
not require just one mechanism for this

2012
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,679
this is something that we can imagine

2013
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:53,120
could evolve

2014
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,560
but really just needs to be something

2015
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,400
that the ecosystem agrees is hard to

2016
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,159
forge um you know it shouldn't just be

2017
01:13:58,159 --> 01:13:59,760
oh you have this ip address it needs to

2018
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:00,480
be

2019
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:04,480
something that's relatively um

2020
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,199
relatively hard to get so one client

2021
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:08,560
couldn't just get a thousand different

2022
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,400
identities very easily

2023
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,239
but users could definitely legitimately

2024
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,120
have

2025
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,880
a few

2026
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,960
identities um you know i may have

2027
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,480
different devices

2028
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,080
that if i'm using device level

2029
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,239
authentication those would look up like

2030
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:24,159
locally different things

2031
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,239
you could also imagine that different

2032
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:27,920
applications or different browsers on a

2033
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,840
single device could use different

2034
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,159
accounts as their root of trust

2035
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:34,159
but effectively the amount i'd be able

2036
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:36,159
to multiply my effect on the system

2037
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,840
would be

2038
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,159
maybe one two or three times not

2039
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:41,840
thousands of times to be able to fool a

2040
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,159
system

2041
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:45,840
and then lastly the thing i want to

2042
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,600
touch upon for deployment is you know

2043
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,679
how we avoid centralization in the

2044
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:51,600
system um it's definitely something that

2045
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:52,640
we are

2046
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,199
conscious of and want to avoid

2047
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,360
um

2048
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,480
so the mediators and the issuers

2049
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,080
kind of by definition are entities that

2050
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,840
are helping represent many different

2051
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,760
clients and origins so there are fewer

2052
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,360
mediators and issuers than clients and

2053
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,040
origins

2054
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,360
um that that is important

2055
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,840
but we should also be avoiding letting

2056
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,560
um the overall ecosystem just have a

2057
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,480
handful of these that are just kind of

2058
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,920
the big players that it's impossible to

2059
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:20,880
get in

2060
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,040
it needs to be easy for new mediators

2061
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,719
and issuers to enter

2062
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:27,199
the overall ecosystem

2063
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:28,480
and you particularly want to avoid

2064
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,239
situations where

2065
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:31,440
issuers who are kind of working on

2066
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,000
behalf of origins only allow a specific

2067
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,679
mediator to essentially force clients to

2068
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:37,520
have a particular type

2069
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,440
of trust in order to be able to use

2070
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,679
different origins

2071
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:42,480
so

2072
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,440
yeah

2073
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,280
this is not an easy problem to solve

2074
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,280
it's the type of thing that is

2075
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,760
difficult to solve at a protocol level

2076
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,520
but we believe that you know private

2077
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,440
access tokens may actually be able to

2078
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,239
have

2079
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,040
less

2080
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,400
centralization problems than other

2081
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,000
alternatives when you think about the

2082
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,960
overall ecosystem

2083
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:02,719
so looking at some of the kind of

2084
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:04,320
comparisons

2085
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,480
as i mentioned before if we don't have a

2086
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,400
good solution in this space we'll see

2087
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,920
and we already do see a lot of things

2088
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,800
moving towards oh a sign in with

2089
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,679
blah where blah is some large company

2090
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:18,400
and these are things that origins

2091
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,920
choose to prefer and choose to partner

2092
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,400
with and they can essentially embed

2093
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,440
um

2094
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,400
some

2095
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,280
relationship with another site um

2096
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,840
that will be more likely to have a user

2097
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,360
account already and they can be sharing

2098
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,040
data on the back end you really don't

2099
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,320
know what they're doing and this is

2100
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:37,280
potentially a big privacy problem

2101
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,719
and so without an alternative for

2102
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,800
clients to use if we're trying to move

2103
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,800
away from captchas and if we have

2104
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,199
more uh you know private ips and stuff

2105
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:47,520
we could see things moving towards this

2106
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,320
and this being a per origin choice

2107
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,679
is something that would be really hard

2108
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:52,800
to move and we're not going to end up

2109
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,159
with a situation we're going to have

2110
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:56,239
sign in with 50 different services and

2111
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:57,520
every little guy is going to get in

2112
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,679
there

2113
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,120
another comparison to make is the

2114
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,159
existing proposals uh like privacy pass

2115
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:07,040
um

2116
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,360
so i'll mention a bit more

2117
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,360
later but privacy pass is something that

2118
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,199
allows a client

2119
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:15,199
to present a token to an origin that it

2120
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:17,520
got from another origin that he was able

2121
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,560
to get

2122
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,040
some bag of tokens for that's not origin

2123
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,040
specific

2124
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,199
and in this case the origins that are

2125
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:26,560
redeeming this

2126
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,960
can choose to discriminate based on

2127
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,719
where the tokens came from

2128
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:33,040
and so they could also be in a situation

2129
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,440
where individual origins could choose to

2130
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,840
prefer major services or choose a small

2131
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:38,880
set

2132
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,560
of token vendors that they trust

2133
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:45,679
with private access tokens

2134
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:47,760
you know overall yes there is

2135
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,159
that general risk but it's important to

2136
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,080
note that the origins don't get to see

2137
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,679
the mediators they're only doing this

2138
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:56,480
through the issuers that they work with

2139
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,320
um so they can origins cannot

2140
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,280
individually discriminate based on how

2141
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,480
the client authenticated they have

2142
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:03,920
actually no way of knowing how the

2143
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,440
client authenticated or what type of

2144
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,199
device or what type of account they had

2145
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:08,960
so it's actually a better privacy thing

2146
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,199
here

2147
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,280
now you could have a situation where

2148
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:17,440
issuers start rejecting new mediators um

2149
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,320
since

2150
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,000
you know meteors and issuers are all

2151
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,679
kind of all talking to each other

2152
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:24,560
they're not really paired in any way

2153
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,400
they are going to be a kind of a

2154
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,239
globally known list and this is

2155
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:29,440
something that could be publicly

2156
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,600
reported and publicly audited if

2157
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,600
there starts to be blockages between any

2158
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,880
of them

2159
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,320
now sometimes this could be legitimate

2160
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,560
like you could have a meteor that starts

2161
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,320
cheating and lying on behalf of its

2162
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,320
clients in that case yeah the ecosystem

2163
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,920
should decide to reject them in the same

2164
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,760
way that you can stop trusting a given

2165
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,159
certificate authority if it stops

2166
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:49,280
uh

2167
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:52,840
behaving correctly around how it signs

2168
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:56,640
certificates so this we think is

2169
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,080
the type of architecture you would end

2170
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,120
up with

2171
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,880
and we think with they could have the

2172
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,000
right incentives to move this forward

2173
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,440
and i do see someone in the cube but

2174
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,880
i'll just quickly finish my slides i

2175
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,520
only have two more

2176
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,120
so anyway we have the question about

2177
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,040
where this work should be done i do want

2178
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,800
to point out that there is a lot of

2179
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,920
related work within privacy pass

2180
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,320
so private access tokens is very similar

2181
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,640
in many ways to privacy pass but it has

2182
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,480
some key differences from what privacy

2183
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,640
pass is currently working on

2184
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,719
first it does involve some per client

2185
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:30,800
and per origin state it's not allowing

2186
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,120
just unlimited access

2187
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,800
and we believe this is actually

2188
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,159
something that makes it much more

2189
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:38,239
attractive and more useful for cases

2190
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,800
that want to be able to replace

2191
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,159
ip address as a rate limiting mechanism

2192
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:46,000
if you don't have that ability

2193
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,239
you still have to fall back on something

2194
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:49,920
like ipaddress to allow you to do the

2195
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,320
right limping

2196
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,679
these are also

2197
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:55,679
tokens that get scoped to a specific

2198
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,199
origin so you don't have any problems

2199
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:59,520
about cross-origin spending

2200
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:03,679
or a case where one origin can end up

2201
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:05,199
essentially consuming your entire bucket

2202
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:06,880
of tokens and you have no more tokens

2203
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,320
left

2204
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,159
for other origins that you prefer to use

2205
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:12,239
it with

2206
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:13,360
it is

2207
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,360
using a private access token to use a

2208
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,080
challenge so it's an online protocol and

2209
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,760
so this doesn't allow you to do the same

2210
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,360
type of token hoarding that you could

2211
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,440
with privacy pass in which you could

2212
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,360
actually get passes from many different

2213
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,600
clients and just hold them on hold on to

2214
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,360
them and then spend them and make it

2215
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,560
look like you're legitimate when you're

2216
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:34,000
not and lastly

2217
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,520
we are defining this as a publicly

2218
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,840
verifiable token so it doesn't require

2219
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,600
the origin to do any

2220
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,360
work of talking to the backend or the

2221
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,800
original

2222
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,600
token issuer to prove that it's a valid

2223
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,719
token

2224
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:48,960
so in some ways we think this could be a

2225
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,480
more generic form and potentially more

2226
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:54,480
useful form of privacy privacy pass

2227
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,400
all right so our question essentially is

2228
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,920
you know first

2229
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,760
what do people think but then if this

2230
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,440
work should be done should it be done as

2231
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,440
something like extending the work that

2232
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,280
privacy pass does

2233
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,440
should it be something short-lived

2234
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,760
um in a very specific working group or

2235
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,040
something else

2236
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,840
and that is all i

2237
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,400
have php

2238
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:20,719
yeah um i like this a lot

2239
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:23,520
uh there's just one slight problem i

2240
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,840
proposed something very similar back in

2241
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,639
2003

2242
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:29,840
and

2243
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,480
verisign has a patent on it

2244
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:36,080
so it's not a very problematic patent it

2245
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,719
was filed march 25th

2246
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:41,440
2003

2247
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:45,360
uh but that is something to bear in mind

2248
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,400
uh the other thing is that

2249
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,320
what i was doing at the time was i got

2250
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,880
very upset about proof of work

2251
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:56,560
which i believe is absolutely appalling

2252
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:59,280
uh proposal i thought then i think it

2253
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,480
now

2254
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,719
and

2255
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:04,960
the claims are very broad it does it

2256
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,719
doesn't

2257
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,800
it's not just for trusted computing

2258
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,600
implementations but the main idea was

2259
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,760
put this in a trusted module on the

2260
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,440
device

2261
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:18,320
and then you can get rid of all your

2262
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:19,600
other

2263
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,600
um

2264
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,800
requirements

2265
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,639
you know all your media

2266
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:27,920
mediating parties go into the device

2267
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,719
uh it might be

2268
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:35,120
that in the current circumstances um

2269
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:38,080
yeah probably the only thing that could

2270
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,639
verify could do to get some value out of

2271
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:42,480
that patent at this point

2272
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:45,199
would be to make some agreement with

2273
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,040
google if you could get google and apple

2274
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,719
involved

2275
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:51,040
they control silicon

2276
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,639
and they could get it pushed into the

2277
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:55,199
hardware

2278
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,080
yeah and certainly you can imagine the

2279
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:00,480
mediator could end up

2280
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,280
in the hardware of the client itself

2281
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,360
yeah it would be very very easy thing to

2282
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,199
add to anything that's got a secure

2283
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:09,520
enclave already

2284
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,600
i mean the reason it didn't happen 10

2285
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,000
years ago was that there was another

2286
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,480
pattern prior to mine that

2287
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,080
stopped it happening that we could never

2288
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,400
get access to

2289
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,960
so yeah

2290
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,040
sorry well thank you for the heads up on

2291
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,480
that

2292
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,679
yeah i i i'll file the ipr or tell

2293
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:32,000
uh bert or whatever to do it

2294
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,639
okay thank you

2295
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:38,960
all right ben

2296
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,600
hi bench work

2297
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,679
i am

2298
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:48,080
so i happen to be one of the chairs of

2299
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,639
privacy pass yes um

2300
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:51,920
i

2301
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,600
think that this work

2302
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,679
uh is appropriate for the privacy pass

2303
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:56,800
working group

2304
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,719
okay i would be happy to see it come

2305
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:00,080
there

2306
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,719
i i don't think that

2307
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:04,880
there's uh you know any presumption that

2308
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:08,000
we would essentially take this work uh

2309
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,760
as is as a and add it as a new working

2310
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,159
group item work item

2311
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:17,120
uh i think that these use cases are

2312
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:20,239
important and that we should think about

2313
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:23,120
uh making sure that we satisfy the

2314
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,000
the

2315
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,679
use cases that are most prominent here

2316
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:29,199
um

2317
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:31,760
and that may mean

2318
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,040
um

2319
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,040
that may mean changing what the privacy

2320
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,280
past working group is working on i don't

2321
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:40,239
think that we should essentially forge

2322
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:42,400
ahead with both this

2323
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,679
and something that looks like the

2324
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,000
current privacy pass

2325
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,120
protocol in parallel i think we should

2326
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,560
essentially

2327
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,639
um look at the elements of these look at

2328
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:54,880
the requirements and come up with

2329
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:58,000
one solution to pursue first at least

2330
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,239
and let it roll out and get some

2331
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:02,239
experience with it before we attempt to

2332
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:03,440
do

2333
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:06,480
you know another permutation of the same

2334
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,639
ingredients for a similar purpose

2335
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:09,679
right

2336
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,280
yeah and just

2337
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,679
speaking to that briefly and you know we

2338
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:14,639
have

2339
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:15,920
you know both chris wood and steven

2340
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:18,960
valdez who are privacy path past authors

2341
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,880
working on this and i think there is a

2342
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:23,120
appetite to

2343
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:24,239
um

2344
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,960
even if long-term

2345
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,520
some of the use cases

2346
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,360
could involve different flavors of

2347
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,719
tokens

2348
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:34,560
to make

2349
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,520
uh

2350
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,679
a lot of the stuff like the token

2351
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:40,239
challenging requesting an issuance

2352
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:42,320
compatible and maybe just have oh i want

2353
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,760
this type of token or i want i have that

2354
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,679
type of token

2355
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:47,120
yeah one thing i think we need to

2356
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,560
consider is that there are going to be

2357
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,800
mixed ecosystems if we have if we have

2358
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,800
multiple of these things no matter

2359
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,719
whether in parallel or sequentially

2360
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:55,840
we're going to end up with mixed

2361
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,199
ecosystems which means we need a

2362
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:58,880
negotiation system a capability

2363
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,880
negotiation to identify which kinds of

2364
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,199
tokens both parties possess which means

2365
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:05,520
we need to think about the

2366
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:08,159
the the entropy leakage the privacy

2367
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:11,280
reduction that is revealed by which of

2368
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,120
these kinds of tokens you actually

2369
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,760
support or possess at the moment

2370
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,520
which means we need a unified privacy

2371
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:18,719
analysis

2372
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:20,560
um i think those are all reasons to take

2373
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,480
this to the privacy password

2374
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,480
great that makes sense

2375
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,960
as an individual i have to say i don't

2376
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,600
find this as compelling as privacy pass

2377
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,960
today

2378
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,239
in particular it seems to me that this

2379
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:38,239
architecture has much more complicated

2380
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:40,480
uh trust relationships required between

2381
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:43,040
the various parties whereas privacy pass

2382
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:45,600
manages to achieve it seems to me very

2383
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,120
similar uh security and performance

2384
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,040
results

2385
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:55,040
with much less reliance on on

2386
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,800
tricky partial trust relationships

2387
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,199
between the parties

2388
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:00,080
so

2389
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,480
uh i think that we should try to you

2390
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:03,920
know essentially lean toward

2391
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,600
computational privacy and away from

2392
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,440
information theoretic privacy to the

2393
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:10,320
extent that we're able

2394
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,960
and privacy pass as currently formulated

2395
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,960
i think gets us a little closer

2396
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,719
also i think there's more similarity

2397
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:17,520
here

2398
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,159
than we let on because both of these

2399
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:22,480
protocols have certain assumptions baked

2400
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,320
into them that we are not particularly

2401
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,159
talking about for example

2402
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:27,520
the uh

2403
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,440
a huge having a huge number of issuers

2404
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,239
here

2405
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:31,199
um

2406
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:34,239
would would get you back into the i

2407
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:36,320
think the privacy pass

2408
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,719
problem of uh of essentially leaking one

2409
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:40,560
bit of information for every issuer that

2410
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,239
is or is not

2411
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:43,280
um

2412
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,560
present

2413
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,560
on the on the client and so that means

2414
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,120
that they share the they share the same

2415
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,360
privacy consideration there

2416
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:54,159
then uh as much as i hate to

2417
01:27:54,159 --> 01:27:56,560
disrupt the technical conversation let's

2418
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,400
end it here and

2419
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,639
uh for all others who are on the queue

2420
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:03,280
so the queue is closed and yeah please

2421
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,080
keep it brief and we we would most

2422
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,760
importantly like to hear your feedback

2423
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,239
on how to dispatch this

2424
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:11,199
okay

2425
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:13,440
um this is just one thing to reply

2426
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:16,480
briefly um you know i

2427
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,400
i agree that is you know desirable to

2428
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,880
have something simple with you know

2429
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,120
simple trust relationships

2430
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:25,199
i think the main issue we see with the

2431
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:27,520
current privacy passes that

2432
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:30,880
it is simple but it also offers um

2433
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,199
sufficiently

2434
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:34,000
uh

2435
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,679
little information low value to the

2436
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:37,440
origins that it's actually not useful

2437
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,920
for replacing a lot of the cases

2438
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,360
that would have

2439
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,199
captchas or would have

2440
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:45,199
other types of

2441
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:46,800
rate limiting today

2442
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:49,280
so we want to just increase the utility

2443
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,920
all right siobhan

2444
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,840
hey

2445
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,840
um

2446
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:18,960
[Music]

2447
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,880
oh

2448
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,120
don't try talking now

2449
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,400
is that better

2450
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,880
yes that's much better okay great

2451
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:29,440
turns up my headphones don't work um so

2452
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,120
yeah we're just wondering it it really

2453
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:33,120
is like um the

2454
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,639
the presentation kind of read like

2455
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:36,719
privacy preserving rate limiting but the

2456
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:39,520
draft mentioned geofencing as well um

2457
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,520
and i saw that i thought there was a

2458
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,760
client hints proposal as well in the

2459
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,360
github repository

2460
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,280
um

2461
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,440
and just wondering like

2462
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,120
yeah like is there was a reason for that

2463
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,960
and i guess like just quickly but the

2464
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,960
other thing was um it seems like there's

2465
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,800
a centralization concern around

2466
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,040
especially the mediators so um they

2467
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,639
might be worth having some discussion

2468
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:02,719
about that in the draft

2469
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:04,159
yeah um

2470
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:05,840
so

2471
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:08,400
yes there are in the draft mentions and

2472
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:09,600
we believe you know the overall

2473
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,440
architecture could allow you to have

2474
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:12,639
other

2475
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:13,920
bits of information other than rate

2476
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,000
limiting like you essentially you could

2477
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
use this or you really use kind of any

2478
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,560
privacy pass type ecosystem

2479
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:21,520
to

2480
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,199
sign or verify that oh yeah you came

2481
01:30:23,199 --> 01:30:25,360
from this country or whatever and you

2482
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,719
know we know something about the client

2483
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:28,480
that way um

2484
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,000
so there are other bits of information

2485
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,920
we don't want to get into the complexity

2486
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:35,840
here in this talk um

2487
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:38,080
what was the second part of your

2488
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,080
uh just uh comment that we should

2489
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,520
probably talk about the centralization

2490
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,679
concerns uh but mediators especially i

2491
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:45,920
think yeah yeah and yeah we should

2492
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,400
discuss that more in the draft

2493
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,360
um

2494
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:52,000
as i mentioned here i think you know

2495
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,920
largely it does degenerate

2496
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,199
to a lot of

2497
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:56,880
other cases where you know essentially

2498
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,840
if an origin can know where

2499
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,320
where your um kind of sign into where

2500
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,239
your root of trust is coming from then

2501
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:06,159
it could similarly

2502
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:08,400
end up favoring

2503
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,480
just a few large actors and you know

2504
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:11,920
hopefully we can actually find a way to

2505
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:14,639
make this better than those

2506
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:17,679
thank you

2507
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:19,600
hecker

2508
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,639
anchor go ahead

2509
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:24,960
hi tommy uh thanks for presenting this

2510
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,080
hello um

2511
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,760
so i think i mean i'll i'll hit this

2512
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:28,800
best question first but i do want to

2513
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,800
talk about technology for a moment um so

2514
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,040
i think this isn't quite ready to go um

2515
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,320
honestly there's a bunch of questions

2516
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,760
about what the actual problem which

2517
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,280
you're trying to solve is um i do agree

2518
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,120
with ben that having this and privacy

2519
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,040
passed together is like bad news so we

2520
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,400
should try to figure out you know what

2521
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:45,520
the itf is going to do in this spaces um

2522
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,360
so i think we really first agree get

2523
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:48,800
agreement on the use cases um do this at

2524
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:51,280
a number of them but

2525
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,800
quite a complicated system and the

2526
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:55,120
complexity all derives from the desire

2527
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:57,040
to have a rate limit on a specific

2528
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,520
client for a specific origin and all the

2529
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,920
other cases you have are largely about

2530
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,600
like making assertions about the client

2531
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,960
in particular but not about the origin

2532
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,880
specifically and so all those can be

2533
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,159
solved with the privacy pass solution do

2534
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:09,840
not need any of this complicated you

2535
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,040
know stop having to do with the media

2536
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,639
and issuer so i think it's really

2537
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:13,760
important to determine whether we think

2538
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:14,719
that's an important enough of an

2539
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:16,800
important use case to motivate um an

2540
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,239
effort in this space and i i guess

2541
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:19,440
you're probably getting from like what

2542
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,520
i'm saying that i'm not persuaded um

2543
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,080
can you explain why

2544
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,719
uh they are not origin related

2545
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:28,560
that essentially having a global pool of

2546
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,639
rate limiting for everything i do would

2547
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:32,239
satisfy these cases

2548
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:34,719
well no what i'm saying is geo

2549
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:35,920
um

2550
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:37,840
does anything to do with the server um

2551
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,440
uh is is it human to something to do

2552
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,400
with the server

2553
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,638
um

2554
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,440
okay but you do list them so like i

2555
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,280
think you know um um and but we have

2556
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,280
captures right the point of a capture is

2557
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,560
the person a human

2558
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,080
and um

2559
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:55,520
and so um uh and and so when you sort of

2560
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:56,880
say oh the alternative is capture this

2561
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,239
well they turn out this is not captured

2562
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:59,360
they'll turn their privacy passes

2563
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:02,800
captures um so um

2564
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,960
we often see that captures will come

2565
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,400
once we have hit

2566
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:09,360
rate limits or once people can prove

2567
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:12,000
or once they do not know if you have

2568
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,679
been below some rate limit and so

2569
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:16,400
avoiding the capture can also be well no

2570
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,480
i don't care

2571
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:19,360
yeah

2572
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,440
sorry we are getting into the next

2573
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:24,159
presentation's time so keep it brief i

2574
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:27,440
see echo your recommendation is not to

2575
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:30,960
dispatch it to privacy pass yet or

2576
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,880
or should it be presented there and it

2577
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:36,400
it can be discussed how to iron it out

2578
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:37,920
is that the recommendation well what i

2579
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,600
would like what i would like to see

2580
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,400
is um a more concrete analysis of the

2581
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,920
use cases and which ones can be

2582
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:47,040
addressed with is it with required

2583
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,320
technology that's fancy and which ones

2584
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,960
do not and um and then we can decide

2585
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:52,560
those use cases are

2586
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:55,120
sufficiently important to solve um to

2587
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,719
pay the price of the complexity and the

2588
01:33:56,719 --> 01:33:58,320
potential um

2589
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:59,520
potential or choke point effect that

2590
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,800
this creates

2591
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:03,040
um i i guess i guess i do i think it's

2592
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:04,080
important to mention this chokepoint

2593
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,360
effect because i think was mentioned

2594
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:08,080
previously um you know that uh we do

2595
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:09,520
have a worked example of this in the

2596
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,040
identity system and we have basically

2597
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:14,320
two identity providers so um and it's i

2598
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:15,920
don't think it's all impossible that the

2599
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:18,159
origins will insist that i see that the

2600
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:20,000
issue only trusts google on facebook and

2601
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,199
apple that would not be desirable

2602
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:22,560
outcome

2603
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,960
i agree

2604
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:27,840
okay andrew keep it

2605
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,080
keep it brief

2606
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:34,400
yep i'll i'll be uh um very brief um but

2607
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,800
just two two quick technical points to

2608
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,280
echo the discussion from yesterday um in

2609
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:42,400
a different working group um i i think

2610
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:46,000
this app really does need to address uh

2611
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,239
before it does go forward uh how to

2612
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:50,639
avoid the problem of colluding um uh

2613
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:52,560
mediators and issuers

2614
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,880
because if that's not addressed um

2615
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,719
the the benefit it's providing is

2616
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:59,600
completely illusory

2617
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,199
and in fact probably unhelpful uh

2618
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:03,920
because it uh potentially implies it's

2619
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,360
giving more privacy when it's actually

2620
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,280
giving less i think that from an end

2621
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,199
user point of view that's dangerous

2622
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:10,639
um uh

2623
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:11,920
if that happens

2624
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,239
um or also i completely agree with

2625
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:16,239
philip about the absolute

2626
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:18,639
appalling use of proof of work and just

2627
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:21,679
as a general principle um

2628
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:24,000
that absolutely should be avoided uh in

2629
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,320
terms of answering the spanish question

2630
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,960
uh privacy pass seems like the obvious

2631
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:31,199
place and i think as somebody just

2632
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:33,040
suggested in the chat

2633
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:34,880
maybe have it looked at in more depth in

2634
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,639
privacy past and then if need be come

2635
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:38,159
back to dispatch

2636
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:41,040
uh after a deeper look um

2637
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:42,800
with more time would be

2638
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:45,360
my suggestion thanks

2639
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,840
so that's good

2640
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:49,760
okay uh

2641
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,480
question to ads and coaches what's the

2642
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,199
dispatch decision here i think you have

2643
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:57,119
been following the chat more more than i

2644
01:35:57,119 --> 01:35:58,639
have but

2645
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:01,600
is is dispatched to privacy pass the

2646
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,520
correct decision here

2647
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,280
yeah there's there's been some um some

2648
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:06,880
proposals of the mic here and some

2649
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:09,440
discussion in the jabra channel so it

2650
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,280
looks like that there's a fairly good

2651
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:13,040
energy behind dispatching to privacy

2652
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:13,920
paths

2653
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:16,159
um having some detailed discussion there

2654
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:18,480
about how to kind of mesh this uh with

2655
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,880
the the use cases and technologies that

2656
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,800
privacy test has

2657
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,600
and if if anything like that new comes

2658
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,679
out of that um i think we can we can

2659
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:29,360
take it up here again but i think to

2660
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,440
first order uh dispatching the privacy

2661
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:34,400
passes the outcome here

2662
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:37,199
sounds good uh thank you yeah

2663
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:39,199
yeah so just to follow up on what kind

2664
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:41,360
of richard said it really does look like

2665
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,679
the expertise to have this conversation

2666
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:45,760
isn't privacy pass so i think if we're

2667
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:49,280
gonna decide uh decide is this privacy

2668
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,440
pass plus this work privacy pass becomes

2669
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,840
this work use cases from this informed

2670
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,159
kind of privacy pass they all nexus is

2671
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:57,600
point all the arrows kind of point back

2672
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,840
to the nexus of privacy pass so let's

2673
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,760
let's continue the conversation there i

2674
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,360
would remind the community kind of we

2675
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,280
still have two potential angles out of

2676
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,360
that you know if we need to change

2677
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:08,960
privacy pass that's a recharger

2678
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,800
opportunity so that's another place for

2679
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,480
us to kind of talk about whether we're

2680
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,239
comfortable with what that what the

2681
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:16,880
scope is uh if there is a scope change

2682
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,040
and then if it turns out that the kind

2683
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,960
of discussion from privacy pass says

2684
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,560
this is different you know again i'm

2685
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,560
kind of purely speculating here

2686
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,239
as others have suggested that that

2687
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:28,320
speaks to another turn through sex

2688
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,800
dispatch then

2689
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:34,000
thanks okay uh dispatch to privacy pass

2690
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,920
in that case uh uh thanks tommy uh

2691
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,760
jake i guess you're presenting i shared

2692
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:43,280
your slides already hope uh that's fine

2693
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:48,119
should we start thank you yep okay

2694
01:37:48,159 --> 01:37:51,040
uh okay great thanks for the time here

2695
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,840
um i'll be talking about uh multicast

2696
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:56,080
security and privacy considerations

2697
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:59,119
uh next slide please

2698
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,119
so the problem we're trying to solve the

2699
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:05,119
scalable delivery multicast of course um

2700
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:07,199
the uh

2701
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:09,760
the thing that we don't know another way

2702
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,199
to solve and the reason we're focusing

2703
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:14,639
on multicast is the uh the congestion we

2704
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:17,199
observe at isp access layers

2705
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:20,560
this is essentially a broadcast medium

2706
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,639
and so sending a single packet across it

2707
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:23,440
for

2708
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,280
all the duplicated traffic that drives

2709
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,880
the peak loads that

2710
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:29,679
are observed at isps

2711
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:30,719
is

2712
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:32,639
something that could be avoided if we

2713
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:34,400
could make use of multicast

2714
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,800
and we see a

2715
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,639
fairly large gap

2716
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:40,480
i discussed this there's a there's a

2717
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:43,040
link to the

2718
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,840
barb off at itf 111

2719
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,679
uh where where i went into a bit more

2720
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:49,760
detail about this

2721
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:50,560
um

2722
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,000
later in the deck

2723
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,480
uh there are other impacts to end users

2724
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,159
that we believe can be addressed in the

2725
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:57,199
same way

2726
01:38:57,199 --> 01:38:59,040
the the capital costs are driven by the

2727
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:01,760
peak load this is both for the sort of

2728
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:04,239
content owner content distribution

2729
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:07,280
network and for the isps and these costs

2730
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,639
pass all the way through to end users

2731
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:11,040
and have a disproportionate effect on

2732
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:14,400
those who can afford it less

2733
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:16,639
and the the peaks are generally driven

2734
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:18,719
by the popular content you know these

2735
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:20,320
these big game downloads the big

2736
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:21,840
sporting events that everybody wants to

2737
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,440
watch at the same time

2738
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:24,800
uh

2739
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,119
and and that's the main thing we're

2740
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:28,639
trying to address

2741
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:31,040
um and the problem keeps getting worse

2742
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,080
uh

2743
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:34,639
you know we can go into more detail on

2744
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:36,719
that but but the motivations i think are

2745
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:37,679
clear

2746
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:42,159
um there's a few things that uh

2747
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:44,400
that people often react to like do we

2748
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:45,520
really have to do something as hard as

2749
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,920
multicast we have looked at peer-to-peer

2750
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,840
for this and of course that doesn't

2751
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,440
address the isp access congestion

2752
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:52,960
problem that in fact makes it worse and

2753
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,360
the isps are firmly against it as

2754
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:58,320
opposed to multicast where as you'll see

2755
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:01,440
in a few moments there

2756
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:04,719
tend to agree it makes sense

2757
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:06,560
application level multicast also doesn't

2758
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,080
address that access layer problem

2759
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,760
although it does help address some of

2760
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,119
the other problems this is essentially

2761
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:14,000
what uh cdns do already

2762
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,360
and

2763
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:17,360
we're finding that there's a substantial

2764
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:19,760
gap that we would really love to to see

2765
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,360
addressed

2766
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:24,400
so the next slide is

2767
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:26,800
uh

2768
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:30,080
we've been working on this at ietf

2769
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,360
already

2770
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:35,280
primarily in the mbd working group

2771
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:37,440
this uh the reason that we did it in

2772
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,840
this order that we haven't come to

2773
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:43,760
security really before is about uh

2774
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:44,800
sort of

2775
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,880
figuring out how viable it's going to be

2776
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,080
are we really going to be able to get

2777
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,440
this stuff delivered

2778
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,360
um but

2779
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:53,440
we started with dozens of informal

2780
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,040
conversations bouncing the idea around

2781
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:58,080
over the course of several itfs with uh

2782
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,880
particularly with a number of

2783
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:04,000
browser implementers just in

2784
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,520
in private discussions seeing if there's

2785
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,840
any obvious stoppers that would make it

2786
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:10,320
clearly impossible uh everybody agreed

2787
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:13,280
there are challenges but that uh with

2788
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,760
sort of uh sufficient buy-in this this

2789
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,440
could be reasonable

2790
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:20,159
um so we went ahead and we made

2791
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:21,760
we made the pieces that we think would

2792
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,679
be necessary we had some proof of

2793
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:25,679
concept implementations done hackathons

2794
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:27,440
have been reporting on it at mbod

2795
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:28,800
there's all these adopted drafts in

2796
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,480
mundi

2797
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:32,880
and uh at the last ietf we ran a barb

2798
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,400
off and got

2799
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,239
you know what feedback we could from

2800
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:37,760
that and now we're trying to sort of

2801
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,840
follow up on the next steps here

2802
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:43,040
uh next slide please

2803
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:48,239
in addition to our ietf work we've been

2804
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:50,080
doing a bunch of outreach outside the

2805
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,600
itf

2806
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:55,040
we've had a bunch of isp conversations

2807
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,040
we consider that kind of the

2808
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:58,880
critical feedback because there's no

2809
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,800
point if this stuff won't get delivered

2810
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,480
but the answer we've gotten has been

2811
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,239
largely positive

2812
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:05,760
we've likewise been talking to a bunch

2813
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:08,639
of the content owner customers we have

2814
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:11,760
about whether this is

2815
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,239
feasible from their side and likewise

2816
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:16,560
the answer is is mostly yes

2817
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:20,159
we did several lab trials um

2818
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:23,280
with isps where the isp gear was being

2819
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:24,880
used to do the multicast forwarding

2820
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,320
based on

2821
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:27,920
based on ingesting according to the

2822
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:30,400
architecture we're proposing using amt

2823
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,760
and dryad

2824
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:34,000
um

2825
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:37,119
references there

2826
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,400
so the the feedback we got from the isps

2827
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:41,440
was that

2828
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:42,960
in some cases there were problems all

2829
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:44,639
the problems we encountered were

2830
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:47,520
were possible to work around by um

2831
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,199
by changing the addressing so we made a

2832
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:51,360
draft about how to do that

2833
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:53,360
this also has been adopted by

2834
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,119
mbo and d

2835
01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:57,920
and uh and so with that we think we've

2836
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:59,760
covered the sort of practical problems

2837
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,119
to

2838
01:43:01,119 --> 01:43:02,800
uh getting this

2839
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,639
potentially delivered and we'd like to

2840
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:07,600
move forward with with the

2841
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,840
the problems of how to do this in a

2842
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:12,239
useful way at the application layers

2843
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:14,719
um we're looking into both web and

2844
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:17,040
non-web traffic primarily because the

2845
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:19,600
peaks that we have are driven by uh by

2846
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:21,840
both of these cases

2847
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:25,840
the the peak traffic loads

2848
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:28,639
but the the web traffic is

2849
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:30,719
is one of the places where

2850
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:32,239
you know we're going to be blocked if we

2851
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:33,840
can't get into browsers and in order to

2852
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:35,520
get into browsers we need to have a

2853
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:37,280
decent security model and there are

2854
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:39,440
differences between the way multicast

2855
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,199
security would work and the way

2856
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:44,080
uh unicast security has worked in uh up

2857
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,000
until now

2858
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,280
so this is why we tried to to cover the

2859
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:50,320
uh

2860
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:53,040
these considerations in the in the uh

2861
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:55,760
draft i hope people got a chance to read

2862
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,760
um

2863
01:43:57,760 --> 01:43:59,600
uh there's some other implementation

2864
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,080
work here uh we've got a w3c community

2865
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:05,360
group um that's uh chartered to try to

2866
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:06,800
incubate the work

2867
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,639
i'm sure that

2868
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:10,800
there's a demo api just sort of proving

2869
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:13,760
the viability of playing video using and

2870
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:18,239
this is this is by the way a port of a

2871
01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:21,119
receiver that that we have as part of a

2872
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:23,119
multicast product that's a wild garden

2873
01:44:23,119 --> 01:44:25,360
multicast tv delivery product

2874
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:26,960
um but we've got that running under

2875
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:30,159
webassembly and playing video in a uh

2876
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:34,800
you know our own build of a browser um

2877
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:37,920
we gave an intent to experiment into uh

2878
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:40,080
chromium and we got some feedback from

2879
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:42,080
them the feedback is kind of what drove

2880
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:43,040
the

2881
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:45,600
uh the the writing of this draft

2882
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:47,520
because we you know the

2883
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:49,119
the point that was made is that we have

2884
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:51,280
to have confidentiality as part of the

2885
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:53,760
design which it was not up until uh up

2886
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,679
until that feedback came in

2887
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:57,920
um

2888
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,400
we get into some of the reasons why that

2889
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,400
is the case in the draft but uh

2890
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:03,520
basically

2891
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:05,679
it was a convincing uh

2892
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:07,600
convincing position and so we've we've

2893
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:08,880
taken it on board and we're trying to

2894
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:10,800
grapple with the complexities that opens

2895
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:13,119
that's the sort of background of the the

2896
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:15,199
genesis of this draft

2897
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:17,839
um

2898
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:20,159
we we are starting

2899
01:45:20,159 --> 01:45:22,719
in the community group with aiming to

2900
01:45:22,719 --> 01:45:24,320
to integrate to web transport and that's

2901
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:25,600
so that we can

2902
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,360
the idea there is that

2903
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,800
you can take existing multicast

2904
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,880
applications if you can solve the

2905
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,719
fundamental security problems

2906
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:35,280
uh that we do outline and draft and sort

2907
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:38,239
of get an acceptable use case then uh

2908
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:40,239
then web transport would be a great fit

2909
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:41,840
and would allow

2910
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,520
in the way that we've already done sort

2911
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:45,760
of adapting existing multicast

2912
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:48,400
applications into a browser context and

2913
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:50,320
deploying them at scale and then would

2914
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:52,880
open up experimentation for

2915
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:55,520
for other apis that would also be useful

2916
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:59,480
uh yeah next slide please

2917
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:02,560
so uh the problems that we

2918
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,639
want to address here we want to separate

2919
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:06,719
the integrity and authenticity from the

2920
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:09,119
confidentiality concerns because

2921
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:10,880
uh these are kind of driven by different

2922
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,239
threat models it's very important to

2923
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:14,480
prevent someone from inserting a packet

2924
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:16,080
of death that's accepted

2925
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,880
and you know uses the rendering bug to

2926
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,800
take over you know

2927
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,080
all the

2928
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,760
all the devices of people watching the

2929
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:26,719
super bowl or whatever

2930
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:28,320
it is likewise very important to protect

2931
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:30,159
confidentiality but this is kind of a

2932
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:32,320
different set of problems and there's

2933
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,679
some trade-offs here that we try to get

2934
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:35,280
into in the draft that

2935
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:37,840
uh that come from the fact that with

2936
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,280
multicast you have the same exact

2937
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:40,880
packets that have to be decoded by many

2938
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,639
different receivers

2939
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:45,600
this inherently creates a sort of

2940
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:48,719
you know content discoverability

2941
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:51,280
problem of some sort but that comes with

2942
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,280
the removal of the destination ip

2943
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:56,159
address which it increases anonymity at

2944
01:46:56,159 --> 01:46:58,320
all the network locations that are just

2945
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,080
you know increasingly distant from the

2946
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:02,080
end from the end user that's receiving

2947
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:03,040
it

2948
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,719
um

2949
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:06,639
we tried to look into like what are the

2950
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:08,400
threat models about here and for

2951
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:10,480
confidentiality most of what's written

2952
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:12,400
down covers like personalized

2953
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:14,320
information things like your medical

2954
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:17,040
records or your bank account info and uh

2955
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:18,320
it's

2956
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:19,119
you know

2957
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:20,960
on top of that the traffic analysis

2958
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,600
discovery is

2959
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:24,880
pretty

2960
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:26,880
good at picking out the

2961
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,960
you know especially popular things

2962
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:29,920
so

2963
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,760
we think this doesn't open up

2964
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,760
particularly new stuff but

2965
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,360
that is a point for

2966
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:38,080
for discussion if this really does

2967
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:40,080
create a an unsolvable hold then we need

2968
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:41,520
to know about it and stop working on it

2969
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,400
but

2970
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:44,320
uh our position is basically that the

2971
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,400
alternatives are just as bad perhaps

2972
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:47,360
worse

2973
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:49,920
um for the the scalable traffic that

2974
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:51,840
that

2975
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,280
we're actually seeing and so we think

2976
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:55,040
this is still worth pursuing in spite of

2977
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:57,119
the sort of differences in the security

2978
01:47:57,119 --> 01:47:58,800
model we're trying to

2979
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,880
get that all articulated and this is a

2980
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:02,639
big part of the work that we anticipate

2981
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:03,679
doing

2982
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:06,400
next slide please

2983
01:48:08,719 --> 01:48:09,679
uh

2984
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:11,040
so the

2985
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:12,400
existing

2986
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:15,679
work is starts with the the

2987
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:18,080
multicast security draft you saw uh we

2988
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:20,719
have an adopted draft in mbondi

2989
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:23,520
that would benefit from security from a

2990
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:25,679
better security expertise

2991
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:26,880
this was

2992
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:30,239
originally argued as being

2993
01:48:30,239 --> 01:48:33,040
reasonable to include in mbd based on

2994
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:35,360
like it doesn't do any novel

2995
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:36,239
uh

2996
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:39,839
crypto anything and

2997
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:42,400
i would argue that if there were a

2998
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,480
multicast focused security place it

2999
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:46,320
would have a better home there because

3000
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:47,600
it really does need some security

3001
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,360
expertise looking at it

3002
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:51,280
um there are other pieces of this that

3003
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:54,800
are likely to also uh require documents

3004
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:57,360
going forward uh when

3005
01:48:57,360 --> 01:49:00,320
i've listed the ones here um as i said

3006
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:02,639
we're trying to target web transport

3007
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:04,560
so documenting exactly how that's going

3008
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:06,239
to work these experiments are just

3009
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:07,679
beginning

3010
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:10,080
but going forward we would anticipate

3011
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:11,520
writing the appropriate documents to

3012
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:13,679
include it and incorporating all the

3013
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:16,320
great feedback and and useful uh

3014
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,400
insights that we get from reviewing the

3015
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:20,080
actual security requirements and

3016
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:21,360
considerations

3017
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:23,280
uh that we've tried to put forth in the

3018
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:26,639
in the multicast security draft

3019
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:28,960
and there there may be uh going forward

3020
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,800
into the other apis some other related

3021
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:33,119
work that we'd want to address as well

3022
01:49:33,119 --> 01:49:34,880
uh including specifically which

3023
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:37,840
protocols would be uh supported by

3024
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,599
browsers and how it would all work for

3025
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:41,360
uh for

3026
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:45,679
handling apis like fetch or download

3027
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:46,719
so

3028
01:49:46,719 --> 01:49:48,800
in terms of getting into browsers

3029
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,320
this is uh

3030
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:52,719
you know we're basically blocked on

3031
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:54,800
on progress until we can get a firmer

3032
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:56,880
consensus answer

3033
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:58,400
or at least a you know a firmer

3034
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:00,639
tentative consensus answer on

3035
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:02,239
what needs to happen in order for

3036
01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:03,920
multicast to be used safely on the

3037
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:06,320
internet with the sort of modern

3038
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:09,520
threat model for the internet

3039
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,760
and uh i think we're really missing a

3040
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:14,000
lot of security expert participation in

3041
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,119
this space

3042
01:50:15,119 --> 01:50:18,000
um at this time so that's basically why

3043
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:23,320
i'm here today uh next slide please

3044
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:25,360
so

3045
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,960
my first question is whether this is

3046
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:29,520
suitable for ietf work and if so

3047
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:33,280
what should we do with it precisely um

3048
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:36,000
you know i have a few ideas here one of

3049
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,280
which is reopen msac that was a

3050
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:42,639
possibly with a retarder um that that

3051
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:44,560
seemed like a pretty good fit for this

3052
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,880
kind of thing uh maybe

3053
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:50,320
a separate thing for broadcast msec

3054
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:53,520
but i would welcome suggestions and uh

3055
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:56,800
feedback on what we're doing here and

3056
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:59,360
uh whether anybody can usefully comment

3057
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:01,040
so with that i will open the floor to

3058
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:02,639
questions

3059
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:04,080
comments

3060
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:07,840
so before we let others weigh in just we

3061
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:10,159
have like nine minutes left and we have

3062
01:51:10,159 --> 01:51:13,360
the option of overflowing on thursday uh

3063
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:14,639
of course

3064
01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:16,800
i would personally prefer to get a

3065
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:19,599
dispatch decision already today but

3066
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:20,639
go ahead

3067
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:23,840
the queue is open ben

3068
01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:28,800
so i guess the

3069
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:31,199
question i have is to try and get

3070
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:33,199
clarity on what you

3071
01:51:33,199 --> 01:51:35,119
what questions you want to answer as the

3072
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:36,880
next steps so

3073
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,159
like i heard

3074
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:41,040
a fair bit about um

3075
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:43,599
like the question being is there a

3076
01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:45,760
security model or security framework

3077
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:46,840
that we can

3078
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:48,719
use

3079
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:50,159
that would

3080
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:53,760
make multicast traffic compatible with

3081
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:55,119
like

3082
01:51:55,119 --> 01:51:57,360
traffic in the web to the browser

3083
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:59,679
is that sort of what you see is the key

3084
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:03,440
question to be answered here uh

3085
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:05,119
i would say with

3086
01:52:05,119 --> 01:52:07,199
with delivering it safely to end users i

3087
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:08,960
think there's a lot of multicast traffic

3088
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:11,760
today that goes to end users that is

3089
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:15,360
not a part of the web security model and

3090
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,599
we can start there certainly like we can

3091
01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:20,400
do some multicast based delivery

3092
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,320
uh on some of our use cases like some of

3093
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:24,480
the uh game delivery

3094
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:27,679
uh pieces or or software updates and uh

3095
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:31,360
as well as as potentially like um

3096
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:33,599
there's there's some interested parties

3097
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:35,040
with uh

3098
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:36,159
that have

3099
01:52:36,159 --> 01:52:38,639
kind of large footprints of the those

3100
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:40,400
like smart tv on a stick kinds of things

3101
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,560
you can plug into the hdmi cable on your

3102
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:44,560
tv or whatever

3103
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,400
and these can these can go ahead and

3104
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:48,480
start deploying multicast

3105
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:50,639
so we can address some of our use cases

3106
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:52,560
today but we do think that web security

3107
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:54,480
is an important part of this and a big

3108
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:56,639
part of the security question we think

3109
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:58,880
that these same security questions are

3110
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,560
applicable to

3111
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:02,400
these other domains as well as well as

3112
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:03,840
the currently

3113
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:06,639
widely used multicast delivery for tv

3114
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:08,480
that's operated by

3115
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:10,800
by msps

3116
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:13,040
so we'd like to address all of these

3117
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:16,159
questions and land on a sort of

3118
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:19,520
as safe as it can be for end users under

3119
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:21,360
specifically what considerations that

3120
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:24,880
are uh properly written down

3121
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:26,560
and to apply that to all of our

3122
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:28,080
solutions um

3123
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:29,920
if the answer is well you have to get

3124
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:32,080
some deployment first then i mean we are

3125
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:33,520
intending to do that to the best of our

3126
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:36,080
ability but browsers are going to

3127
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:38,320
be a big part of solving the ultimate

3128
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:40,480
problem of scalability that we need

3129
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:42,719
yeah okay so still like looking at a

3130
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:44,960
security model but maybe i i was too

3131
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:47,599
narrow in the initial statement

3132
01:53:47,599 --> 01:53:48,800
yeah i mean

3133
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,320
web doesn't have to be the starting

3134
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:51,840
point but i think it's one of the more

3135
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:54,880
complex spaces and so it's one of the

3136
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:56,400
ones we want to get the conversation

3137
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:58,400
started on today because we think we're

3138
01:53:58,400 --> 01:53:59,760
going to land there

3139
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:02,000
yeah

3140
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:05,119
hecker hi oh and thank you ecker for

3141
01:54:05,119 --> 01:54:06,320
your feedback on the list really

3142
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,639
appreciate the conversation there

3143
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:10,880
thank you um yeah i mean i think it is a

3144
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:12,880
dispatch question um i think

3145
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:14,719
i don't know where to take this um

3146
01:54:14,719 --> 01:54:16,480
um i guess i'm not sure your problem is

3147
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:18,480
quite the problem you think it is um

3148
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:19,599
um

3149
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:23,360
uh richard vegas like like i i i i

3150
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,400
didn't read that message with chris

3151
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:25,920
barroscu and i guess what i would say is

3152
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,280
if chrome were really enthusiastic about

3153
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:28,159
this then you would get a different

3154
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:30,000
message um and it wouldn't have said

3155
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,599
like probably problem for me and i'll be

3156
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:33,520
interested um i think we're like i think

3157
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:35,280
you're probably not very about security

3158
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:37,599
um um but i think probably like trying

3159
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:39,760
um i guess i would say like there really

3160
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:43,119
are two up security models um one is um

3161
01:54:43,119 --> 01:54:44,000
you know

3162
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,360
uh the one that's certainly implied by

3163
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:46,719
web transport whatever you see and there

3164
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:48,880
was the one that's applied by fetch um

3165
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:50,320
and as they fetch as the origin model

3166
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:51,280
and web transfer but we can see

3167
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:54,320
something quite different um i i i

3168
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,159
do not think there's like any

3169
01:54:56,159 --> 01:54:56,960
like

3170
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:58,400
any any near future chance of like

3171
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:01,199
having this somehow mapped into the the

3172
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:03,199
true web origin security model it's says

3173
01:55:03,199 --> 01:55:04,239
they're just too different and we spent

3174
01:55:04,239 --> 01:55:05,360
so many years trying to reason about

3175
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:07,280
that and only barely understand it now

3176
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:08,560
that i just like like think that's

3177
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:10,080
extremely unlikely um that people want

3178
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:12,159
to put the effort into it um

3179
01:55:12,159 --> 01:55:14,639
the um uh maybe your chrome version that

3180
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:16,080
mapped into like the web transfer over

3181
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:17,360
to the model which is like not really

3182
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:19,119
tied to origins um because that's a much

3183
01:55:19,119 --> 01:55:21,440
more simpler kind of case um

3184
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:23,440
but i i guess you know um i guess i

3185
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:25,119
would say like the itf is probably not

3186
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:26,400
the place to think about that at some

3187
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:28,719
level because the security properties um

3188
01:55:28,719 --> 01:55:30,800
the people are not the actual security

3189
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:31,840
properties technically right here are

3190
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:33,119
not that complicated what's complicated

3191
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:35,360
is mapping into the web so um i'm not

3192
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:36,800
saying again i'm not quite sure what to

3193
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:39,119
do about that um um

3194
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:41,040
question whether we have a question yeah

3195
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:42,639
well thanks we are certainly engaging

3196
01:55:42,639 --> 01:55:45,280
with w3c as well um we've opened the

3197
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:46,560
discussion with web transport in

3198
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:49,760
particular and uh and web networks uh

3199
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:51,920
interest group has has taken some of

3200
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:53,840
this on uh maps well with some of the

3201
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:55,199
sustainability work that's starting

3202
01:55:55,199 --> 01:55:57,280
there but um

3203
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:58,800
we do want to get the conversation

3204
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:00,719
underway i mean you're kind of right

3205
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:02,560
about chromium they're

3206
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:04,880
they're not interested but

3207
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:06,320
my read is that they're not interested

3208
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:07,840
because they're skeptical it will end up

3209
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:09,280
working

3210
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:10,800
i think a lot of people have that

3211
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:13,199
skepticism and multicast has a history

3212
01:56:13,199 --> 01:56:16,719
that certainly justifies it but um

3213
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:18,159
you know we do think this problem needs

3214
01:56:18,159 --> 01:56:20,239
solving this is a really good way to do

3215
01:56:20,239 --> 01:56:22,880
it and that the problems do not look

3216
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:24,800
fundamentally unsolvable so to the

3217
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:26,239
extent that we can

3218
01:56:26,239 --> 01:56:28,560
get continue gaining traction and get

3219
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:30,480
some forward progress on this i don't

3220
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:32,239
think it's really as out of reach as

3221
01:56:32,239 --> 01:56:33,599
people think it is

3222
01:56:33,599 --> 01:56:34,400
um

3223
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:36,159
but i i do

3224
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:38,320
acknowledge that that remains to be seen

3225
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:42,280
but thanks for the feedback there

3226
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:46,000
watson

3227
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:49,760
labs cloudflare um

3228
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:51,360
it's not clear from my presentation

3229
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,119
whether or not you need a protocol to

3230
01:56:53,119 --> 01:56:54,639
meet security properties have a good

3231
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:56,480
idea about or don't really under don't

3232
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:58,320
really have an idea of what the security

3233
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:00,320
properties are you need to meet

3234
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:02,080
and i agree with echo that if you you

3235
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,199
don't know what security properties you

3236
01:57:03,199 --> 01:57:05,920
need to meet that sort of w3c

3237
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:07,599
versus coming up with a protocol to meet

3238
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:09,360
the networks in multicast which might be

3239
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:12,480
more of an iepf thing

3240
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:13,920
so uh

3241
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:16,719
we have some idea we think

3242
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:19,360
that the the draft we put forth about

3243
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:21,599
security considerations presents a

3244
01:57:21,599 --> 01:57:23,360
model that we invite

3245
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:26,480
uh criticism on and we'd like to sort of

3246
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:29,679
hash out to everyone's satisfaction um

3247
01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:32,800
the the feedback we see from w3c is that

3248
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,880
well obviously this has to have the

3249
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:38,080
underpinnings of of uh protocols that

3250
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:40,639
satisfy the web security model needs

3251
01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:41,520
and

3252
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:43,840
so this is the the sort of

3253
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:44,800
um

3254
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:46,400
middle ground we're stuck in

3255
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:48,480
at the moment and if we can get some

3256
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:50,000
forward progress on agreeing with the

3257
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,480
security model get some feedback on on

3258
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:55,760
what that's doing then as we as we

3259
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:57,280
go ahead with trying to build the

3260
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:59,040
protocols that meet that security model

3261
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:00,320
then we'll have some confidence that

3262
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:01,440
it's actually

3263
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:03,199
driving in the right direction

3264
01:58:03,199 --> 01:58:04,639
uh that's kind of the way we're looking

3265
01:58:04,639 --> 01:58:06,800
at this now

3266
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:08,719
it's it's got a lot of moving pieces and

3267
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:09,520
a lot of

3268
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:12,320
people involved absolutely but

3269
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:14,480
i you know if you've got a better idea

3270
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:16,800
what we should do please

3271
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,960
we have like two minutes left so ben

3272
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:20,960
keep it very short

3273
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:21,920
hi

3274
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:24,400
uh i i think that this piece of work is

3275
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:27,040
too big to do all at once

3276
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:29,280
uh i think that that the first step

3277
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:31,520
would be to solve the protocol problem

3278
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:33,040
and leave the browsers out of it

3279
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:35,840
basically and i think there is a logical

3280
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:38,000
way to do that my suggestion would be to

3281
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:41,360
dispatch to cdni and treat this as

3282
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:46,080
a cdn to cdn multicast use case where

3283
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:47,920
you're moving content

3284
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:50,000
where you're essentially standardizing a

3285
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,800
component of application layer multicast

3286
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:55,199
so yeah that i believe is using these

3287
01:58:55,199 --> 01:58:56,080
two

3288
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:58,480
client is a cache box

3289
01:58:58,480 --> 01:58:59,440
and

3290
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:00,880
and then we can come back to the

3291
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:02,480
question of how to move that cache

3292
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:04,880
closer and closer to the client

3293
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:06,719
wow

3294
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:08,480
uh so we believe that problem is already

3295
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:11,599
solved and irrelevant to this case so um

3296
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:14,400
at least that's my belief uh so thanks

3297
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:16,960
for your feedback

3298
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:18,719
uh

3299
01:59:18,719 --> 01:59:20,159
i think uh

3300
01:59:20,159 --> 01:59:22,719
we have to stop here and we need to come

3301
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:25,119
to some sort of uh

3302
01:59:25,119 --> 01:59:26,960
consensus on what's the best way to

3303
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:29,520
dispatch this what i saw on the list and

3304
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:32,719
i received some chats

3305
01:59:32,719 --> 01:59:35,280
people seem to be saying we are not sure

3306
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:37,360
at this moment but perhaps discussing

3307
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:39,840
this on a mailing list

3308
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:42,800
seems sensible

3309
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:45,040
would it make sense to dispatch this to

3310
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:47,760
a mailing list say msec or starting a

3311
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:49,360
new mailing list that depends on the

3312
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:51,599
aeds and and the authors who are driving

3313
01:59:51,599 --> 01:59:53,440
this

3314
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:54,800
so

3315
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:56,159
how about we

3316
01:59:56,159 --> 01:59:58,159
we continue the discussion on a list

3317
01:59:58,159 --> 01:59:59,920
once there is enough traction and we

3318
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:00,719
have

3319
02:00:00,719 --> 02:00:03,920
more clarity whether this is cdn to cdn

3320
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:06,800
whether uh browser should be included in

3321
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:08,880
the first attempt or not

3322
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:11,520
uh will result from the discussion on on

3323
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:13,760
that mailing list and it's up to the ads

3324
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:15,440
and you which mailing list this

3325
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:17,520
discussion happens on we'll obviously

3326
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:19,679
inform on sect dispatch

3327
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:21,199
for those who are interested in

3328
02:00:21,199 --> 02:00:23,280
continuing this discussion how does that

3329
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:24,719
sound

3330
02:00:24,719 --> 02:00:28,239
uh it is is that okay

3331
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:30,800
sounds like that sounds like a great

3332
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:32,960
plan so you know jake if you want to

3333
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:34,719
reach out we can talk about whether a

3334
02:00:34,719 --> 02:00:38,719
new mailing list makes sense or and sec

3335
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:41,360

3336
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:42,639
much

3337
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:46,080
so we are right at the hour i think i'll

3338
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:48,560
just summarize the two dispatch uh

3339
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:50,639
decisions uh

3340
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:53,280
for multicast security the discussions

3341
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:56,159

3342
02:00:56,159 --> 02:00:58,400
private access tokens we have

3343
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:00,400
tentatively dispatched it to privacy

3344
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:01,440
pass and

3345
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:02,800
the working group needs to make a

3346
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:04,400
decision on whether it needs to

3347
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:05,840
recharter

3348
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:08,639

3349
02:01:08,639 --> 02:01:10,880
send it back to sec dispatch and and

3350
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:11,840

3352
