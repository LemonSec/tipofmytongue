um

7
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,800
the um

8
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,479
all right so

9
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,040
welcome to the uh

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,720
ntp working group

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,000
at ietf 112

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,159
we have

13
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,320
one hour today so we're going to need to

14
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,679
be pretty efficient

15
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,040
starting out uh

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,439
we have

17
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,360
uh so i believe dieter is planning to

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,280
take minutes if anybody wishes to help

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,920
him that would be great

20
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,520
um

21
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,159
also if there's any volunteer to pay

22
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,680
attention to the

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,880
uh chat log uh sometimes i lose track of

24
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,720
the chat depending on

25
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,840
how much conversation is going on so

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,799
if we could get somebody to

27
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,159
pay attention to that it would be

28
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,560
helpful

29
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,840
also

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,320
this is the ietf notewell that you will

31
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,598
have seen many times this is all of the

32
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,760
rules and processes and procedures that

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,560
we

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,720
follow

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,599
um we have a couple of um

36
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,280
online meeting things to remind

37
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,599
everybody as a reminder this session is

38
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,200
being recorded

39
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,000
also the chat is recorded

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
so

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
you just need to remember that

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,360
these are the

43
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,519
basic reminders for an online meeting

44
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,440
the one thing to note is that the blue

45
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,200
the blue sheets are now automatically

46
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,560
generated by data tracker

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,400
if you have any additional questions you

48
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,920
can find that information there

49
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,519
the

50
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,720
next

51
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,440
slide is a reminder about the ietf code

52
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,120
of conduct and some of the key points

53
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,720
associated with that

54
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,840
uh the main uh one being to be sure that

55
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,599
we treat everybody with respect and

56
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,840
courtesy

57
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,599
and so with that

58
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,640
we will move on to the agenda

59
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,720
this is the administrative

60
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,680
and agending agenda bashing portion of

61
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,319
the agenda

62
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,319
do we have any

63
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,000
agenda bashing to be done

64
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,599
nope

65
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,040
okay

66
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,720
so um

67
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,640
the next slide begins

68
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,840
our discussion of various working groups

69
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,959
uh

70
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,480
document status review

71
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,159
things that we don't necessarily need to

72
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,519
have presentations on today or

73
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,599
discussion on today but just to remind

74
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,000
everybody of where we are

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,599
we have been working through an updated

76
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,959
charter that's currently out for

77
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,440
external review uh the link to that

78
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,080
draft charter is

79
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,319
is shown there

80
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,760
uh

81
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,879
you uh as i think eric noted in the in

82
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,760
the chat um

83
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,439
we're recharging we're also very

84
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,879
slightly changing the name we're

85
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,560
changing it from network time protocol

86
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
to network time protocols

87
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,159
uh and that way we can keep the history

88
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,560
of all of that

89
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,040
it also gives us the

90
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,720
approval in the charter to do things

91
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
like rough time and some of the ptp

92
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,240
associated things that we're working on

93
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,320
next on the list is the mode 6 commands

94
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
which has been languishing for quite a

95
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,560
while

96
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,160
it went through iesg evaluation there

97
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,360
was some

98
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,280
if you will recall some discussion on

99
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,880
the historic versus informative

100
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,560
status of the document

101
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,800
um there was a resolution to that and as

102
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,280
of about uh and i

103
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,560
uh

104
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,880
it's awaiting an update from brian i

105
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,560
communicated with him earlier today and

106
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,639
he expects to have a uh

107
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,040
update out very shortly

108
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,160
uh

109
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,759
the next one

110
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,880
is the yang model which is also an iesg

111
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,800
evaluation awaiting

112
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,880
an author update

113
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,639
i know drove had hoped to get that done

114
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,199
by monday but the reality of an ietf

115
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,520
week has intervened um

116
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,039

124
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,000
believe me people need to have patience

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,520
with me so i'm happy to have patience

126
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,039
with others

127
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,039
um

128
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,880
speaking of patients with me

129
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,120
the interleave mode is in iesg

130
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,400
evaluation

131
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,120
it's been deferred

132
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,759
and it needs some guidance from eric it

133
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,600
also needs the correct write-up which is

134
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,320
one of the things waiting on me

135
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,680
i don't know that we need to say much

136
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,400
more about that

137
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,759
the

138
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,240
next document i i just put this one in

139
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,880
this list because we will be

140
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,080
finishing it up and and then moving

141
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,039
further discussion to ntp to the mtp

142
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,440
working group is the ptp enterprise

143
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,759
profile uh there was a small update to

144
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,800
that done

145
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,919
um

146
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,160
and it's ready to go to the isg it's

147
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,720
awaiting a write-up

148
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,680
and

149
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,680
one of the things in particular that it

150
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,560
needs to reference now is the ongoing

151
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,880
ieee effort uh

152
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,600
i took the 1588 effort to address

153
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,039
terminology

154
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,720
so

155
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,479
we know the terminology in this document

156
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,840
is going to be a little bit problematic

157
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,680
but um

158
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,800
it's ieee 1588 is already

159
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,440
working on that issue and

160
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,599
this will just point to that activity

161
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,840
um

162
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,560
alternative port is in working group

163
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,759
last call

164
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,440
we did not close out that working group

165
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,039
last call there has been some discussion

166
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:07,919
on it

167
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,199
um

168
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,720
is there anything anybody wants to say

169
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,520
about that here

170
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,160
i think it's really up to dieter and i

171
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,080
to close out that working your glass

172
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,000
column and determine next steps which we

173
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,759
have done yet go ahead eric

174
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,039
uh yes uh you'll probably note that i i

175
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,400
sent um

176
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,360
uh uh magnus will do a uh early tsv area

177
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,479
review

178
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,479
uh for the uh

179
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,800
bits oh right

180
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,560
so excellent i i did note that you had

181
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,720
sent that i forgot to mention that

182
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,639
that had been done

183
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,800
i'm hoping that we don't get told that

184
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,199
that uh reports are

185
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,599
old news

186
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,520
that's it everything is alpn now but

187
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,879
anyway

188
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,560
yeah we'll see

189
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,000
um

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
so the uh

191
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,400
chronos document was updated uh in

192
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,479
august but there has been very limited

193
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,840
discussion on it i don't see any of the

194
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,440
chairs here

195
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,479
any of the authors here i don't believe

196
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,960
looking through the list again

197
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,319
um

198
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,160
so this has been adopted as a working

199
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,319
group document um

200
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,240
but progress on it has slowed down

201
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,280
so um

202
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,360
i think the next step is probably for

203
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,279
dieter and i to reach out to the authors

204
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,880
and see if we can

205
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,120
get this to the point where it could

206
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,880
is ready for a working group last call

207
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,640
figure out what the next steps for that

208
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,399
document are

209
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,120
the next document that we don't have

210
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,440
that we is the ntp update registries

211
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,680
rich did submit an update to that and he

212
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,519
suggested to the mailing list

213
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,040
that it was ready for a working group

214
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,240
last call

215
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,519
um

216
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,260
i don't see rich on this in this meeting

217
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,600
[Music]

218
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,600
uh

219
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,240
i believe

220
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,320
it can be moved to work last college

221
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,760
anybody that

222
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,720
uh

223
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,160
does not want to see that done or

224
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,839
anybody who thinks additional discussion

225
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,279
is needed on this document prior to

226
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,000
working for the last call

227
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,760
no

228
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,880
okay

229
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,120
so that's the

230
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,519
all of the

231
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,120
documents

232
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,839
the in the sort of quick document status

233
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,480
review update section uh the next part

234
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,560
of the agenda is uh

235
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,920
is

236
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,800
is rough time rough time is next so

237
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,560
uh watson do you want me to share or are

238
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,199
you gonna share

239
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,440
your slides

240
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,120
the slides that would be

241
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
most appreciated

242
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,200
okay

243
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,560
i shall do that

244
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,560
um

245
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,399
which is a special slide well

246
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,079
we'll make it work

247
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,519
yeah so

248
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,440
this is rough time at iatf 112

249
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,760
and the next slide has the things that

250
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,560
we

251
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,480
want to talk about so i'm going to start

252
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,160
by recapping the problem we want to

253
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,320
solve so this is for cases where you

254
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
have time that needs to be accurate

255
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,760
in a few seconds um hopefully less but

256
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,320
that's what's guaranteed and the reason

257
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
we need this is for things like

258
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,079
certificate validation

259
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,800
30 certificate errors are caused by

260
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,959
inaccurate client clocks and getting rid

261
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,399
of that would be a very big boot to

262
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,680
cruise security there's other

263
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,000
applications um

264
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,959
that's sort of the problem

265
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,720
and

266
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,800
so there were we have a whole laundry

267
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,640
list of issues

268
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,040
that came about during the pretty active

269
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,279
discussion on the list uh the past few

270
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,880
weeks we haven't had a chance to turn

271
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,600
this around into a document update

272
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,560
um

273
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,079
and there's another whole slide of

274
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,479
issues

275
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,120
so

276
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,920
all of these issues

277
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,519
we we have some conclusions about we

278
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,320
think

279
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,240
it's on the next slide that most of them

280
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,399
are editorial

281
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,240
um

282
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,120
and

283
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,480
we'll move to middle settings everywhere

284
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,160
we're gonna change that's gonna affect

285
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,920
the size of the fields we'll see if that

286
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,560
gets it down to 32 bits it might not

287
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,920
uh the comparison to rfc 3116 or

288
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,200
whatever it was

289
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,680
is no you just write a section it's not

290
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,959
not a problem

291
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,040
uh but some deserve more discussion

292
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,480
because they're they're maybe a little

293
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,639
more contentious

294
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,959
so the the first thing is the shot

295
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,320
512 only um there was a debate about

296
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,440
whether or not we need another hash

297
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,560
function

298
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,240
the reason we want this is cross

299
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,360
protocol signing is bad you really don't

300
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,959
have any guarantee of security when

301
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,639
you're using the same key two different

302
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,839
ways

303
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,279
um educate 519 uses sha 512 internally

304
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,440
so you're not paying a penalty and code

305
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,959
size for it

306
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,240
um we also need to have we ideally have

307
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,160
a very high degree of support if people

308
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,320
point to pki x as an example where you

309
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,760
have all these things supported you

310
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,959
don't

311
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,200
because what actually happens is the cab

312
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,120
form has very restrictive rules on what

313
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,399
can be signed

314
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,560
and they have it for the same reason

315
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,040
browsers don't want

316
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,880
browsers don't want a situation where

317
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,440
some cas are working with some browsers

318
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,880
they need they want to have a very

319
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,519
uniform playing field

320
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,600
um and as for the question about

321
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,519
accelerating roll out

322
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,200
you don't really have a celebrated

323
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,480
rollout if you're if you have sort of an

324
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,120
identifier versus a new version

325
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,079
um it just doesn't you know this is

326
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,160
experiencing tls it takes a while no

327
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,680
matter what you do

328
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,120
now there are some kind of arguments

329
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,360
that sort of the the extensibility

330
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,519
piecewise is good

331
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,120
and that the cross protocol attacks are

332
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,279
more theoretical than real and those are

333
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,360
fine arguments

334
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,800
and you know hopefully after this

335
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,320
presentation we have some discussion

336
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,120
about that so it's another issue

337
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,160
that they think deserves some discussion

338
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,320
uh and this is about greece there were

339
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,399
some questions about using it there are

340
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,560
some editorial questions about like what

341
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,440
exactly do you do ignore it etc and

342
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,959
we've put those in and why do you need

343
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,680
this

344
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,079
and the reason you need this is you use

345
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,279
it or you lose it um this is a long and

346
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,079
bitter experience in tls

347
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,480
it so greece was introduced into tls for

348
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,880
this reason it's a good idea

349
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,639
it prevents you from having situations

350
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,639
where you have intolerant

351
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,399
firewalls or other middle boxes that

352
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,920
prevent you from saying the protocol

353
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,360
further

354
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,720
um

355
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
and then we have one or two more issues

356
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,920
i think

357
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,839
uh so someone can talk about slow

358
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,279
signatures we've really tried to pick

359
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,600
the fastest one

360
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,040
um

361
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,120
rsa would be even faster but it's much

362
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,959
slower signing so that's not a great

363
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,800
choice

364
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
and we're talking about one additional

365
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,760
signature verification it's not a huge

366
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
burden although obviously if your

367
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,440
application is not

368
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,120
is different it might be a bird now i'd

369
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,240
really like to know more about your

370
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,920
application and understand what we can

371
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,120
do to

372
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,760
speed it up

373
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,199
and

374
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,040
there's two more all right there's also

375
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,839
a question not using the only time

376
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,519
keeper um so

377
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,079
i don't know what i don't think there's

378
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,240
protocol changes we need to make

379
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,600
i think it should just work like ndp

380
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,959
um we can't really put in a center time

381
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:11,920
because

382
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,000
especially after signing because that

383
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,680
just won't work

384
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,680
um but we need to do some experiments to

385
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,320
really see how bad

386
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,760
the result is it's not going to be as

387
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,680
great as ntp but we really need some

388
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,560
experiments to see

389
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,519
uh there's also a question at leap

390
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,079
seconds and dti minus gtc and sort of

391
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,920
unnecessary so

392
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,880
they're um

393
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,560
the the leap seconds

394
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,880
are

395
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,880
so the thing is they're there they're

396
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,759
optional tags row server and client um

397
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,880
there's a lack of standardized

398
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,440
distribution service data and the itu is

399
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,800
recommending

400
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,680
that you include these things

401
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,639
um

402
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,199
in time signals and

403
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,240
you know time minus utc is sort of

404
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,639
understandable um ut1 minus utc a little

405
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,279
more exotic but you know people people

406
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,680
do sometimes want it and the itu

407
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,079
recommends you have it so why not you

408
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,399
know it's optional

409
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,560
well that concludes my presentation and

410
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,959
if you have questions i'd love to answer

411
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,119
them

412
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,399
okay

413
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,720
um

414
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,439
everybody does

415
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,399
everybody understand how to get in the

416
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,800
queue if you wish to speak

417
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,040
um

418
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,240
i'm not seeing anybody in the queue so

419
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,800
uh do you

420
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
have a rough time so right now there's

421
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,160
two documents do you have a rough time

422
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,320
frame of

423
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,839
what you want to do next with those two

424
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,399
documents

425
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,600
system one up

426
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,480
yeah um so we have the ecosystem one

427
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,319
and that one is

428
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,559
a bit stalled we really would like input

429
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,079
from other people who are running

430
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,720
servers or running clients uh and into

431
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,799
what they see from the ecosystem the

432
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,039
wire protocol one i i think we're going

433
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,439
to revise and submit a new version in

434
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,119
next few weeks i would like to note that

435
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,400
eric

436
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,799
klein has said in chat that i suspect

437
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,720
you should ask for an early section

438
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,559
review probably around the same time the

439
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,320
doc is considered ready for working

440
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,120
group last call

441
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,080
okay

442
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,639
makes sense

443
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,799
um

444
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,320
it seemed like a

445
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,480
fairly extensive list of issues so do

446
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,080
you think the next

447
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,520
revision will be ready for working your

448
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,200
glass call or will it i guess it'll

449
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,400
depend on the comments after the

450
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
revision comes out

451
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
well i thought this revision was ready

452
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,360
but turns out it turns out

453
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,039
a bird um so i'm i'm not going to be as

454
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,880
optimistic with the next revision but i

455
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,520
do think we can address because a lot of

456
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,840
these issues were

457
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,640
editorial and

458
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,520
i

459
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,280
but i do think you know if the next

460
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,799
revision comes out it would be nice to

461
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,320
get comments from people who still don't

462
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,840
agree with the way we've handled the

463
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,200
issues

464
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,200
um

465
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,240
all right

466
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,080
thank you

467
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,919
uh still still seeing nobody in the

468
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,799
queue to ask any questions we will

469
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,679
uh

470
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,000
thanks watson

471
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,160
the uh

472
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,039
next thing on the agenda is the ntp v5

473
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,440
use cases uh james

474
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,120
would you like to run your own slides i

475
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,799
think i messed up with watson i think he

476
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,400
actually asked to run his slides and

477
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,559
then i did it uh i don't mind uh either

478
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,520
you share or i share your call

479
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,760
uh you go ahead

480
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,760
okay

481
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,480
uh you have to accept my screen request

482
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,480
i thought i had but i guess double

483
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
clutching i hadn't really

484
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,679
oh there we go

485
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,080
okay uh so uh i kind of lied last uh

486
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,400
ietf meeting and i i've sort of the

487
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
interim i can't remember which i said

488
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,320
that i was not going to do any more work

489
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,840
on this

490
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,280
uh but

491
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,559
um

492
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,880
uh my ability to focus got the better of

493
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,080
me and i did a uh version o2 uh which

494
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,600
there's obviously been a lot of robust

495
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,200
debate about some of the high level

496
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,679
topics but just about cover what i've

497
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,640
changed i have done a very initial

498
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,919
threat model

499
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,440
uh on

500
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,640
ntp and its usages as a whole a very

501
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,120
high level stuff um i've added in some

502
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,480
net requirements changes to some of the

503
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,200
other requirements and lots of myths and

504
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,960
spelling mistakes and uh so forth um

505
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,200
i've also done some other further work

506
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,799
after the o2 release that's not um

507
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,840
published yet uh restructuring basically

508
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,360
restructuring a huge amount of the

509
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,760
documents so it's using the

510
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,559
uh iana and security recommendations as

511
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,919
they were intend supposed to be used

512
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,159
um the other thing that i've done uh

513
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,000
since i've last um

514
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,960
talked about this draft is i sat down

515
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,200
and did some analysis

516
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,880
on everything that is depended on or

517
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,919
referred to rfc 5905

518
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,960
but also the uh adjacent rfc

519
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,240
specifications for ntbv4

520
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,400
related things and to to understand if

521
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,559
there is any sort of dependencies there

522
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,960
that may be important when considering

523
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,360
ntp v5

524
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,200
uh and and so the next couple of slides

525
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,240
i'm just going to talk about what i

526
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,880
found and and leave some ideas for

527
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,159
people to

528
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,080
um

529
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,960
uh to have a mull about when this when

530
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,880
we discuss this document and its

531
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,799
progressions further

532
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,159
so um

533
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,799
i found over 80 rfcs i didn't read all

534
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,720
of them at length but at least skim

535
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,640
through what i thought was the most

536
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,440
important bits uh 10 of them obviously

537
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,799
are

538
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,640
docs that have come out of this working

539
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,520
group

540
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,600
uh most are informational

541
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,760
most are just

542
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,000
fulfilling a requirement to say

543
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,240
you must have accurate time or you must

544
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,240
have a reliable time source

545
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,799
maybe you should use ntp

546
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,080
um but

547
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,799
where there are other dependencies on on

548
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,280
um

549
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,960
5905 they saw i've sort of lumped them

550
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,840
into three sort of subjects of

551
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,679
uh the usage of

552
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,240
uh date formats of mtp epoch of metadata

553
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,640
and identifiers and service discovery so

554
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,840
i'll just talk through those really

555
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,960
quickly

556
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,720
so what i mean by this

557
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,520
is i'm referring to the

558
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,640
uh

559
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,559
the ntpe poc which is obviously

560
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,360
different from unix epoch gps so on and

561
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,799
so forth

562
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,720
and also around the way that ntp

563
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,150
um

564
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,240
[Music]

565
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,440
represents time stamps date

566
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,320
and other such information

567
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,559
turns out that there's quite a few

568
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,200
protocols out there that are effectively

569
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,760
lifting copying and pasting or referring

570
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
to directly those

571
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,720
formats and are expecting to have those

572
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,880
epochs to be used

573
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,919
um and so there may be as a result of

574
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,919
this work some thinking we would have to

575
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,320
do around whether or not we decide to

576
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,960
change which epoch we use

577
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,840
or

578
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,240
um uh sorry i'm brain farting out here

579
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,520
uh or whether or not the way that uh

580
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,320
the data model around dates and times

581
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,200
uh may be a a quite unquote breaking

582
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,840
change

583
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,039
um the other big users and these are

584
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,280
used by media protocols and also used by

585
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,200
the time and by protocols are used for

586
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,360
performance or at least latency

587
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,600
measuring jitter measuring of

588
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,000
uh networks as as themselves and this is

589
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,120
probably because a lot of these

590
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,919
implementations are

591
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,840
not only doing these measurements but

592
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,600
they're also using

593
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,559
ntp services to to generate uh those

594
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,640
values and there's some thinking we're

595
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,000
probably going to have to do when

596
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,120
getting around to the designer v5

597
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,039
the second one is metadata and

598
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,600
identifiers there's a few documents out

599
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,000
there they're mostly yang related

600
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,159
i don't see any huge issue

601
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,880
with ntb v5 and

602
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,320
uh these obviously we will have to uh

603
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,240
consider doing a yang model for ntbv5

604
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,200
uh if it's substantially different or

605
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,720
regardless

606
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,960
and the last one service discovery

607
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,760
um

608
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,880
ntp v4 doesn't really have uh the dhcp

609
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,559
version 4

610
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,559
option it does have v6 which is 5908 and

611
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,840
there are there isn't a icmp v6 uh ra

612
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,480
uh and so there's a there'll be a

613
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,400
kind of an orthogonal question about

614
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,320
whether or not we need to potentially do

615
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,400
a document that defines

616
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,840
dhcp

617
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,760
slash ipv6 r8 options for ntp v5 in the

618
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
future and we don't have to answer that

619
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,840
as part of the protocol design but there

620
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,600
may have to be a consideration about

621
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,320
what information would be included in

622
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,720
the option

623
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,919
uh so what's left um

624
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,400
if you ask me

625
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,600
and we haven't even adopted this

626
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,559
document left there's a handful there's

627
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,000
only a small handful of things that i

628
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,600
think need doing apart from a bit of

629
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,240
editorialization

630
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,000
um i think that there's a bit more work

631
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,279
that needs to be done on the threat

632
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,240
model

633
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,039
um a bit more covering rate limiting

634
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,799
data minimization

635
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,960
and i would also open it up to

636
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,320
discussion about whether there's

637
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,640
anything else uh this document is

638
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,840
lacking

639
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,799
um

640
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,760
every time i've posted

641
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,120
on the on the list a new version we seem

642
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,520
to end up going down the road of talking

643
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,640
about

644
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,720
either time scales

645
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,919
leap seconds or or uh

646
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,039
mandatory security or not uh and i've

647
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,440
i've said this in the past and i i'll

648
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,640
say it again

649
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640
uh those things are still up for the

650
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,039
negotiation and what i'd like to do is

651
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,080
have

652
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,559
this adopted as a working group document

653
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,039
so that those those quite frankly

654
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,120
controversial things can then be uh sort

655
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,600
of bound by working group consensus as a

656
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,159
means of attaining agreement rather than

657
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,159
just being an individual document and me

658
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,200
being able to put whatever i want

659
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,960
um so that's it

660
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,000
uh is there any questions or uh

661
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
fruit to share throw it my way

662
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
um

663
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,400
while we're looking for any questions

664
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,080
the the one thing that you mentioned was

665
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,400
that it has not been adopted and i think

666
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,640
um

667
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,400
now that we're pretty close to having an

668
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,640
updated charter i think it

669
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,240
probably makes sense to go ahead and do

670
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,159
a call for adoption on this document

671
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,000
unless somebody thinks unless somebody

672
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,440
has a reason why we shouldn't do that

673
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,559
boy you guys are really quiet today

674
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,159
um

675
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,000
before you before before the call for

676
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,159
adoption happens i would like to crank

677
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,720
out one more version

678
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,440
uh

679
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,320
before that happens

680
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,640
oh hello doug

681
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,159
hello uh so you you mentioned sort of

682
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,840
the top three things that people love to

683
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,720
debate about this um and one is the the

684
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,960
security thing and you do have statement

685
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,960
in there here about making security

686
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,399
mandatory

687
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,200
but really

688
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,600
not not much else

689
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,399
i i wonder if it'd be worth the

690
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,000
and i'm not saying we shouldn't adopt

691
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
this as a working group document anyways

692
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,080
but um

693
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,919
some kind of elaboration like how would

694
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,000
that look in the requirements document

695
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
if

696
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,080
it's not enough just to say security

697
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,439
should be mandatory we need to

698
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,760
have a little more discussion on like it

699
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,919
okay it needs to be you know one of

700
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,640
these mechanisms or

701
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,080
uh you know how does that look

702
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,799
so

703
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,159
that there is a bit more than just

704
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,640
saying security is mandatory and i think

705
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,399
that there's been

706
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,919
a jumble up even on my side about the

707
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,720
the language that is used to describe it

708
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,240
because i think some people have

709
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,679
conflated

710
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,520
uh confidentiality

711
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,399
with authentication um

712
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,760
you know one of the things i've tried to

713
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,600
be adamant about is

714
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,480
it's my preference that the protocol

715
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,360
have

716
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,640
mandatory authentication but

717
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,360
optional confidentiality

718
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,320
um and then in terms of

719
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
uh how that is

720
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,039
implemented well

721
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,360
um i'm i'm open to you know i don't

722
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
think the require that that's a solution

723
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,200
and i think that requirements draft

724
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,720
shouldn't be

725
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
overtly descriptive about what that

726
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,720
solution is i think the

727
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,000
consensus that i've understood so far is

728
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,320
maybe it should just use nts

729
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,399
because you know it's it's there and it

730
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,000
works

731
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,559
i'm not sure what else

732
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,520
needs to be elaborated on

733
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,480
on that topic asides from the threat

734
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,960
model that i've include i've started to

735
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,640
work on which

736
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,159
the outcome of it which includes both

737
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,279
the risks and what i believe

738
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,520
potential mitigations in the protocol

739
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,080
which thus become requirements if

740
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,399
there's anything else there that

741
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,240
should be part of it can you give me

742
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,080
maybe a bit more of a specific example

743
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,720
of what you mean by more detail

744
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,000
well i'm thinking about uh

745
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,679
someone trying

746
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,679
wanting to do maybe some kind of

747
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,520
lightweight security for

748
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,000
simple simple devices what would be the

749
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,200
minimum requirements

750
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,120
well that would come down to the actual

751
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,799
protocol specification what we agree for

752
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,399
would be the actual technical solution

753
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,399
um if there's

754
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,600
if there's um

755
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,440
i think about the best way of saying

756
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,240
this

757
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,960
um if there's a

758
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,480
if there's uh sort of uh

759
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,039
performance requirements in terms of

760
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,720
thinking about uh embedded devices or

761
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,760
you know

762
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,880
power uh compute and with crypto

763
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,640
constrained in uh

764
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,880
requirements that you think should be

765
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,240
part of it

766
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,559
um it'd be good to know what those are

767
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,480
not sure that answers your question

768
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,960
yeah and i i don't have something in

769
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,480
mind i'm just uh

770
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,000
i'm just thinking there there might be a

771
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,600
little more detail on that i'll think

772
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,320
about it and maybe post something on the

773
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,159
reflector

774
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,399
okay

775
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,279
um

776
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,440
one question uh james you said you

777
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,880
wanted to do one more spin of the

778
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,399
document before we did a call for

779
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,559
adoption do you have a rough time frame

780
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,760
for when you

781
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,679
expect to do that

782
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,760
um i could definitely have something

783
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,600
done before the next ietf meeting

784
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,320
okay

785
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,720
um go ahead rich

786
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,720
what kind of things are you planning to

787
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,399
do and is there any reason why you

788
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,480
couldn't be adopted and then done with

789
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,279
the working group looking at it

790
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,840
uh

791
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:48,799
so

792
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,960
my biggest concern is just the structure

793
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,320
of the document

794
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,760
um i've

795
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,640
uh restructured it quite a fair bit in

796
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,559
the past couple of weeks

797
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,960
uh maybe maybe what i can do is just

798
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,840
publish the restructured bit

799
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,880
um

800
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,120
maybe with one or two small changes push

801
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,760
that out as a as an o3

802
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,880
we can do the call for adoption and

803
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,880
assuming that the working group has no

804
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,279
objections and and chooses to adopt it

805
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,679
then i can carry on with the rest of the

806
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,399
other changes in my um uh queue of

807
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,360
things i'd like to do

808
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,039
you know and see if

809
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,399
after adoption

810
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,120
i would encourage you not to wait until

811
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,679
march

812
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,120
no um

813
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,640
what i can do is i can probably have a

814
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,640
crack at um

815
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,480
tying things off this weekend

816
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,000
because i have a whole bunch of other

817
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,519
ietf related uh chores to do

818
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,519
uh and then you know maybe sort of next

819
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,120
week or the week after have something

820
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,720
actually published

821
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,039
does does that sound a bit more um

822
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,440
timely

823
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,960
that sounds much better to me anyway

824
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,200
okay

825
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,519
yeah i would prefer that as well i'd

826
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,840
like to see us

827
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
get to consensus on this document pretty

828
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,760
quickly because

829
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,840
we have some stuff cued up behind it

830
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,760
okay yeah i'll try and get something

831
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,000
done in the next week or so and

832
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,519
i don't like making promises like that

833
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,919
but okay

834
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,080
um

835
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,720
all right thank you james uh

836
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,640
so the next item on the agenda that i

837
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,080
have is uh ntp v5 we do have an updated

838
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,880
document uh we don't have a presentation

839
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,279
i'm not sure if there's uh anything

840
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,880
mayor slav do you want to say anything

841
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,960
with respect to this or just ask for

842
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,559
additional comments on the mailing list

843
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,399
hi can you hear me

844
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,519
yes

845
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,720
okay great

846
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,000
yeah

847
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,480
the latest version there was just one

848
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,159
small change

849
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,918
there was a suggestion from doug

850
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,359
there are no

851
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,599
real changes

852
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,960
in the protocol

853
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,719
and i think the dependency here is

854
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,599
on those requirements that are still not

855
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,639
clear

856
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,679
and

857
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,839
i would

858
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,520
yeah ask for

859
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,918
making those requirements

860
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:32,960
clear

861
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,000
as dark commented on

862
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,800
specifically about the

863
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,760
security part like

864
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,800
my draft does it meet those current

865
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,839
requirements or does it not i'm not sure

866
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,159
yeah that would be

867
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,159
nice if i could see how my draft fits

868
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,640
into those requirements

869
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,240
and maybe

870
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,720
it's just my observation it seems to me

871
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,160
that

872
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,359
um

873
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,359
there are two groups of people and they

874
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,160
are

875
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,280
putting on opposite sides of the rope

876
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,200
like one group is

877
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,119
seems to me is interested in

878
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,640
extending the

879
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,119
use cases that are currently exist for

880
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,160
ntp before but

881
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,560
the other group is trying to restrict

882
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,119
them like make one

883
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,960
proper way to use ndp

884
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,000
be it

885
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,280
fully secured or not secure i don't know

886
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,960
and

887
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,760
i

888
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,240
suspect there will be no consensus

889
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,520
reached

890
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,720
on

891
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,520
one set of requirements so maybe if it

892
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,970
would make sense to

893
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,359
[Music]

894
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,520
split

895
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,960
this effort

896
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,240
like one

897
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,200
true

898
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,119
proper mtpv for the future and one

899
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,200
that's trying to

900
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,520
fix ntp v4

901
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,320
and

902
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,880
it doesn't have to be called ntp v5 it

903
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,920
could be something else

904
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,480
yeah that's a uh

905
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,240
i think you're true i think you are

906
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,279
correct that there are

907
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,800
uh

908
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,440
difficult to resolve

909
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,960
differences of opinion right now and

910
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,960
what ntp v5 should do

911
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,800
what the solution to that is i'm not

912
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,920
really sure um

913
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,599
that's why i'd like to see that

914
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,040
requirements

915
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,720
finished sooner

916
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,000
rather than later um

917
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,480
yes doug

918
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,040
yeah just to comment

919
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,520
i wanted to say i really like

920
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,560
uh

921
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,800
that the way um

922
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,960
leap smearing is made

923
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,960
transparent in this

924
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,240
proposal

925
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,480
because i think in you know

926
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,720
hidden leap smearing is is just a

927
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,119
catastrophic data center

928
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,520
uh failure that's waiting to happen as

929
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,880
more and more data centers are

930
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,280
are adding becoming more dependent on

931
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,520
precise timing and they

932
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,040
they all tell me they want to do leap

933
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,960
smearing like google does and um

934
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,760
i just think that it's

935
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,000
making it visible is way better than

936
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,359
pretending it's not going to happen

937
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,400
go ahead nurse love

938
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:56,880
um

939
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,720
i have no comments

940
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,880
oh okay i did you showed up in the queue

941
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,160
i just thought you had something

942
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,319
additional to say um

943
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,119
okay

944
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,040
so

945
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,920
uh

946
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,680
everybody please take a look at the ntp

947
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,000
v5 draft that miroslav has and also take

948
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,839
a look at james's draft and

949
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,079
think about how we can

950
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,599
figure out a way forward for these

951
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,400
there's nothing else on that the next

952
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,480
topic is

953
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,400
ntp over ptp

954
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,720
uh mayor slav did you want me to share

955
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,078
slides or are you gonna do it

956
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,960
oh you're doing it already never mind

957
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,200
can you please done can you please share

958
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,000
them

959
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,839
here share the butt click the button

960
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,839
oh sorry i hit the wrong button

961
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,480
can you do it again

962
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,320
so so many little tiny buttons

963
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,000
oh you want me to share them sorry i

964
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,480
will do it

965
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,400
can you hear me

966
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,599
yes i can

967
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,280
okay

968
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,119
yeah uh just a short presentation

969
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,079
uh first slide please

970
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,599
okay so

971
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,920
with any time synchronization protocol

972
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,079
like ntp or ptp

973
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,960
accuracy of the synchronization depends

974
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,359
on how accurate are the times times of

975
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,320
the messages that the protocol is using

976
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,440
absolute accuracy is not as important as

977
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,079
symmetry in the errors in the receive

978
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,240
and transmit timestamps

979
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,880
if the errors are symmetric they cancel

980
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,839
out

981
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,359
in the calculation of the offset

982
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,760
but the error needs to be stable to

983
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,800
enable a stable synchronization of the

984
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,720
clocks

985
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,760
on a computer running

986
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,440
a software implementation of the

987
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,119
protocol

988
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,119
there are few different places where the

989
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,920
timestamps can be captured application

990
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,960
timestamps are least accurate

991
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,119
kernel and driver timestamps are more

992
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,319
accurate

993
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,160
and most accurate are

994
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,920
hardware timestamps

995
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,040
that's

996
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,119
when the networking controller

997
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,040
has its own clock for timestamping

998
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,200
usually it's implemented in the mac

999
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,920
at the physical layer it's much more

1000
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,599
accurate

1001
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,440
it's close to the actual wire or fiber

1002
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,480
but this is very uncommon especially

1003
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,599
at higher networking speeds

1004
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,480
next slide please

1005
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,920
here is an example of errors in

1006
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,800
kernel and driver timestamps

1007
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,400
as we can see

1008
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,720
they are

1009
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,000
not really

1010
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,440
randomly distributed and they are all

1011
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,920
kinds of bending

1012
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,640
that depends on

1013
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,240
networking load

1014
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,040
cpu load and all kinds of things

1015
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,000
next slide

1016
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,119
now this is an example of

1017
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,440
make hardware timestamps

1018
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,720
the absolute errors are now

1019
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,040
better than one microsecond and they are

1020
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,720
very stable

1021
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,960
there is an asymmetry

1022
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,319
but this can be compensated in software

1023
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,119
if necessary

1024
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,040
next slide please

1025
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,200
the problem for ntp

1026
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,520
is that some widely used networking

1027
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,720
cards

1028
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,760
cannot timestamp or receive packets it's

1029
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,680
a limitation

1030
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,480
in the hardware design

1031
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,119
usually the timestamping is limited to

1032
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,359
ptp messages

1033
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:02,800
sometimes

1034
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,280
the filter can be configured to a

1035
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,760
specific ptp version

1036
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,359
transport or message type

1037
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,680
support for ntp is very rare i think i

1038
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,680
saw only one chip that

1039
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,119
actually

1040
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,839
had a filter specific to ntp

1041
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,520
s4

1042
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,280
the transmission

1043
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,560
usually any packet can be timestamp

1044
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,839
it's not an issue

1045
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,720
next slide please

1046
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,160
okay so the solution for ntp is obvious

1047
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,400
we can wrap ntp messages in ptp messages

1048
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,440
this way the hardware will generate

1049
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,599
a timestamp and

1050
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,720
the ntp implementation can use it

1051
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,000
for

1052
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,920
controlling the clock

1053
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,880
[Music]

1054
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,359
this is the proposal

1055
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:07,280
uses a valid ptp message

1056
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,200
it will not break

1057
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,440
normal ptp clocks if they receive this

1058
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,359
message for example

1059
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,839
due to a misconfiguration

1060
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,880
there is a possibility to use the ptp

1061
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
correction field

1062
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,319
but

1063
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,520
unica support in switches

1064
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,000
seems to be very rare

1065
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,880
and currently i don't think it's worth

1066
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,720
the trouble

1067
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,598
next slide please

1068
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,960
here is some hardware that i tested

1069
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,599
it mostly worked

1070
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,599
the one problem was

1071
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,280
with the 10 gigabit uh broadcom card

1072
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,119
it seems its

1073
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,560
ptp support is limited to multicast so

1074
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,400
it doesn't work with

1075
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,760
ptp unicast and not even with ndp over

1076
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,760
ptp

1077
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,640
next slide please

1078
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,359
okay this is one of the

1079
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,480
uh controls i tested it's a cheap

1080
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,480
on-board

1081
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,640
make that's

1082
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,250
widely available

1083
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,839
[Music]

1084
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:24,720
there two identical machines

1085
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,720
and they are connected directly without

1086
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,520
any switches between them

1087
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,400
the graphs show the offset measured by

1088
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,280
ntp this is the row offset not the

1089
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,599
offset of the clock it's

1090
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,520
yeah

1091
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,560
with plain ntp

1092
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,119
we can see the offset is jumping around

1093
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,240
by tens of microseconds

1094
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,920
not great

1095
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,440
but when we

1096
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,720
wrap

1097
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,880
ntp in ptp

1098
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,200
we get the missing hardware received

1099
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,000
timestamp and offsets

1100
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,839
dropped by three orders of magnitude

1101
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,520
there is likely a significant asymmetry

1102
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,010
in the

1103
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,079
[Music]

1104
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,040
in the

1105
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,520
receive and transmit timestamp that this

1106
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,400
hardware is generating but as

1107
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,079
the hardware is identical on both sides

1108
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,960
these asymmetries cancel out so

1109
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,599
it's now very close to zero there is

1110
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,760
some small asymmetry left about 10

1111
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,560
nanoseconds as we can see in the graph

1112
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,960
and i'm not sure where that comes from

1113
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,640
could be

1114
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,280
difference on

1115
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,400
pci latency i'm not sure

1116
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,520
there was

1117
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,640
the test

1118
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,480
there was the system plug involved for

1119
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,839
comparing these measurements so it's

1120
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,280
even

1121
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,680
even the hardware is identical something

1122
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,800
is slightly off

1123
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,599
uh next slide please

1124
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,760
okay this is the same test but now with

1125
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,680
a switch

1126
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,880
between the two computers and we can see

1127
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,800
that the switch added

1128
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,760
few hundreds of nanoseconds of jitter

1129
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,000
and there is an asymmetry of

1130
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,839
about 200 nanoseconds

1131
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,040
this is

1132
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,000
quite common for a cheap switch

1133
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,359
this was an office great switch not no

1134
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,480
nothing

1135
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,359
in a data center or some low latency

1136
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:32,880
application

1137
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,440
with a better switch this would be

1138
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,400
better

1139
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,839
but

1140
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,480
even as it is i think

1141
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,920
it can be great in some use cases

1142
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,119
next slide

1143
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,640
okay any questions

1144
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,839
go ahead martin

1145
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,520
hi

1146
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,400
uh thanks for the presentation um i have

1147
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,440
two questions the first one is

1148
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,040
is this approach or this protocol only

1149
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,359
for an intern for a local network

1150
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,000
and the second question is

1151
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,520
why we

1152
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,599
what is the advantage of

1153
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,599
ntp over ptp instead of plain pdp in the

1154
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,079
local network or if if we run it in the

1155
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,599
local network is the first question

1156
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:30,880
um

1157
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,000
okay so

1158
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,720
this is not limited to local networks if

1159
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,240
you want it you could use it over

1160
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,359
internet

1161
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,599
but as

1162
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,000
if you

1163
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,079
if you communicate over internet the

1164
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,880
latencies are much more variable and

1165
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,319
this

1166
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,960
this improvement of

1167
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,040
microseconds inaccuracy of the

1168
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,559
timestamping

1169
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,359
becomes insignificant compared to the

1170
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,319
latency of the internet

1171
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:03,599
and the jitter of the internet typically

1172
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,040
a millisecond

1173
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,839
depending on how close you are

1174
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,558
to the server

1175
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,359
but as for the security there is no

1176
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,280
security issue because there is no

1177
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,200
amplification so this cannot be

1178
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,480
exploited

1179
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,960
even if it was

1180
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,280
publicly accessible

1181
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,960
and if you want it

1182
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,880
this is now implemented in crony you

1183
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,400
could try it

1184
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,800
and the other question was

1185
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,440
what is the advantage well i think

1186
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,079
we have discussed this

1187
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,760
on the mailing list

1188
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,319
there are many issues with ptp

1189
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,480
the security issues

1190
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,680
the amplification

1191
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:46,559
and

1192
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,920
in many cases there is a need to account

1193
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,280
for the

1194
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,480
errors in synchronization the concept of

1195
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,280
root delay and root dispersion that ntp

1196
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,079
has

1197
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,800
ptp doesn't have this concept so it's

1198
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,160
difficult to estimate the maximum error

1199
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,319
yeah

1200
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,759
i i tried to

1201
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,240
list some of the issues of ptp in the

1202
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,520
draft

1203
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,960
you can look into that if you think

1204
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,000
that's

1205
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,559
accurate

1206
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,599
okay thanks

1207
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,839
go ahead okay

1208
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,280
yeah so um

1209
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,440
just a couple of comments one is

1210
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,160
i'm dubious about this over wide area

1211
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,240
networks because if

1212
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,800
you go through enough routers then ptp

1213
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,440
is not really any more accurate than ntp

1214
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,119
because the error comes

1215
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,040
mostly from cueing

1216
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,880
not from hardware time stamping at the

1217
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,319
end point

1218
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,559
um

1219
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,640
the other comment i wanted to make is i

1220
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,880
i've gotten a lot of input from people

1221
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,599
in the finance industry

1222
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,240
who they're using ptp because they need

1223
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:06,960
the

1224
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,200
precision of it but they actually don't

1225
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,240
like the way pgp works

1226
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,079
you know in theory you can make you can

1227
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,760
have multiple grand master clocks in ptp

1228
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,359
and then combine them in a voting

1229
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:20,640
algorithm but none of the

1230
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,119
implementations do that

1231
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,160
um

1232
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,200
and that's

1233
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,319
sort of the default for ntp and they

1234
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,160
they really like that

1235
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,960
um that aspect of npp so that would be

1236
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,800
another reason why people might want to

1237
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,960
do this

1238
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,480
okay

1239
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,800
um

1240
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,520
go ahead

1241
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,720
to say something

1242
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:08,880
okay no

1243
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,920
just uh okay i i would like to to also

1244
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,040
to to say the same comment when you are

1245
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,520
trying to synchronize about internet you

1246
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,240
you got a several problem this is one of

1247
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,119
the problem that i address with the the

1248
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,640
draft that i presented to tiktok

1249
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,599
but

1250
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,520
my question to mirolab is

1251
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,680
you always find the same

1252
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,440
the same bias

1253
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,800
to the

1254
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,559
to the transmitter or to the receiver

1255
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,480
nowhere um

1256
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,200
even if you try to invert the

1257
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,520
transmitter and recycle

1258
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:55,040
this is just a question about curiosity

1259
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,400
i'm sorry what was the question

1260
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,280
yes but you you you showed that you you

1261
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,880
have some some bias in in your

1262
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,680
it's not symmetrical or i i don't

1263
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,480
remember if the cyber or the

1264
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,240
but if you invert recycle the machine

1265
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,400
trying to to to send

1266
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,640
the the

1267
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,040
the the client and the server you if you

1268
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,119
invert the machines the the real

1269
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,839
machines do you observe that the the

1270
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:30,240
bias is immersed or

1271
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,680
you always got a bias in the same

1272
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,559
idea it's always imagine the reciter for

1273
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,720
instance

1274
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,230
okay

1275
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,559
[Music]

1276
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,000
yeah

1277
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
i think i tried this experiment to swap

1278
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,240
uh the cards

1279
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,960
it was different cards not this one and

1280
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,960
sorry i forgot less result i think

1281
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,200
i think it was something

1282
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,400
with the machine itself like the the

1283
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,920
the sign

1284
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,800
of the asymmetry stayed with the machine

1285
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,040
that's how i remember it but i could be

1286
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,400
wrong

1287
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,480
i have in those machines there are

1288
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,920
different cards they are in the same pci

1289
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,359
slot so

1290
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,000
the order is the same

1291
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,400
the cpus are configured to the same

1292
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,240
frequency so the reading over pci takes

1293
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,920
the same time but

1294
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,319
there was always some asymmetry and i

1295
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:29,680
think it was

1296
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,920
slightly different between different

1297
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,240
cards within few nanoseconds

1298
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,400
okay because i i i used to

1299
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,359
synchronize microcontrollers and i have

1300
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:44,640
problems

1301
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,880
with the even if the microcontroller

1302
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,520
seem to see seem to be the same there

1303
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,280
are always

1304
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,440
some some bias which

1305
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,520
normally

1306
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,000
depends on on the hardware it depends on

1307
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,160
the on the on the

1308
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,800
the machine itself but sometimes it's

1309
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,599
always in the in the function it depends

1310
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,800
just the the recycler has always i don't

1311
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,599
know it's always late for interest

1312
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,119
something like that

1313
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,960
but what just

1314
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,800
about curiosity many sense

1315
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,720
thanks

1316
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,680
i'm gonna go ahead and

1317
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,040
close the queue for this because i want

1318
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,800
to get to the last topic so doug if you

1319
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,319
could be quick

1320
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,559
yeah i just uh you know when you get

1321
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,599
down to

1322
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,359
when you get below a microsecond then

1323
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:34,960
there's like a lot of well-known

1324
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,920
asymmetries like the differences between

1325
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,599
fives

1326
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,970
forward and reverse transmission and

1327
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:43,119
[Music]

1328
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,839
and cables if you have long cables all

1329
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,839
have skew

1330
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:51,319
in them as well

1331
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,839
all right uh so miroslav do you have

1332
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,240
anything else you want to say

1333
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,640
no that's okay

1334
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,799
all right thank you very much

1335
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,240
um

1336
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,319
so we have uh

1337
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:11,760
five minutes left

1338
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,200
um

1339
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,040
martin was going to give us a quick

1340
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,799
update on the

1341
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:21,640
progress on the nts for ptp work

1342
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,000
yes hi

1343
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,400
um yes at this point some information

1344
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,200
about ptp security

1345
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,839
so far we have two nts based draft

1346
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,640
documents for securing pdp

1347
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,520
on the one hand we have nts for pdp

1348
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,480
which rana bambar and i are working on

1349
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,640
and on the other hand we have nts for

1350
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,160
updp which is developed by meinberg

1351
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,280
we know that two draft documents are not

1352
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,319
helpful

1353
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,480
and therefore we met this tuesday and

1354
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,119
wednesday to find a common solution

1355
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:59,119
which all authors of both proposals

1356
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:00,880
so we work together

1357
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,880
and

1358
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,680
we had long and constructive

1359
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,640
discussions on how we want to secure ptp

1360
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,480
and how we could realize that

1361
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,599
i think stance we are going to merge our

1362
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,640
approaches and design a new protocol

1363
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,240
so we will

1364
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,520
probably use the unicast approach in nts

1365
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,640
for updp and the multicast supports

1366
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,160
approach in nts for ptp as a template

1367
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,720
currently we are at the very beginning

1368
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,960
and

1369
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,640
the process

1370
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,520
is ongoing so

1371
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,079
that we die redesigning of the protocol

1372
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,799
the goal is to use ntsc establishment

1373
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:50,559
protocol as a key distribution mechanism

1374
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,640
for pdp

1375
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,520
however we cannot yet say when the first

1376
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,359
draft will be ready

1377
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,160
but we are making progress i think maybe

1378
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,400
in two or three months maybe faster

1379
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,920
but there's a lot of discussions

1380
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,000
currently but we're working together and

1381
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,119
we won't push one

1382
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:15,040
document one protocol nts for pdp

1383
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,480
so yeah

1384
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,359
so far for the on the topic of ptp

1385
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,839
security

1386
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:25,599
okay thank you

1387
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,920
we look forward to the updated draft

1388
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,400
so that update went really quick so um

1389
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,640
that brings us to any other business

1390
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,879
uh

1391
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:41,040
we had

1392
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,240
out of our last meeting we had

1393
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,680
had agreed to do

1394
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,480
virtual interims which we did not do

1395
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,079
um

1396
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,319
given what some folks have said about

1397
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,680
when they planned some updates

1398
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,839
i was thinking perhaps a virtual interim

1399
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:58,880
in the

1400
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,119
mid-january time frame might make sense

1401
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,119
does anybody have any thoughts on that

1402
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,799
i do think we make faster progress when

1403
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:16,799
we have virtual interim meetings

1404
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,440
and it also gives us more control over

1405
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,040
scheduling

1406
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,720
go ahead james

1407
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,400
provided they don't clash with all the

1408
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,559
other interims that i have around the

1409
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:29,839
middle of january sure

1410
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,960
oh yeah there is that

1411
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,200
um

1412
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,559
okay

1413
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,160
um

1414
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,640
anything else

1415
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,279
go ahead rich

1416
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,359

1417
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:49,200
rebooted um what happened at the

1418
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,520
beginning with the registry draft

1419
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,359
updating registration

1420
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:55,680
i asked if there was any opposition to

1421
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,119
doing a working group last call and

1422
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:59,200
there was none so i expect normal the

1423
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,040
issue
