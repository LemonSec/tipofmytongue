as always we start off our meetings by

24
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,680
going over

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,159
our policies procedures for how we

operate at the ietf

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,040
and

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,040
we have a set of

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,830
bcps of documents that cover

31
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,680
[Music]

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,680
how we operate and

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,560
notably related to

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,799
contributions to the ietf intellectual

35
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,000
property

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,159
and next slide

37
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,520
and a

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,759
piece that uh that

39
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,520
the isg has asked us to really highlight

40
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,960
it was on the previous slide as we

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,880
always mention it but really want to

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,200
highlight uh code of conduct and that

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,920
it's um uh we've had a very a

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,840
long-standing document long-standing

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,520
practice for how we should treat each

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,000
other with respect and courtesy and be

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
professional

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,600
um and it's you know it's okay to have

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
uh heated arguments but keep it

50
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,719
technical and and keep it on on the uh

51
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,040
topic and the isg is asked to highlight

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,000
this uh you've seen discussions on the

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,318
ietf list so

54
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,879
you know it's an important topic

55
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,200
next

56
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,200

automatic uh we use the chat or jabber

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,560
for

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,959
um

62
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:32,959
a little bit of side comments but if you

63
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,879
would like to say something at the mic

64
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,400
and you're unable to come to the mic

65
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,120
yourself please just put at mike into

66
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,560
the jabber and someone will read it out

67
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,200
and we are using medieco's integrated

68
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,280
queue control

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,519
i mentioned earlier hedge dock code emd

70
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,080
whatever it's being called today um

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,720
for uh note taking and

72
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,519
please joining us there uh the link in

73
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,519
the chat is the right link i think the

74
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,120
rank link here might be wrong but

75
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,280
and all of our material is online next

76
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,150
we have a fairly

77
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,840
[Music]

78
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,560
long agenda but unlike normal

79
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,120
we actually have time that's available

80
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,280
for discussion normally we have these

81
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,760
ridiculously packed section we asked for

82
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,760
some extra time we got it so we have a

83
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,920
little more time for discussion

84
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,720
um it is possible that the

85
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,360
um the network slices discussion will

86
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,680
continue past its allotted time in which

87
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,480
case um we will still take the half hour

88
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,080
break but we will just can pick up the

89
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,640
conversation at the start um right after

90
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,120
the break so that is that number four

91
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,879
might extend into number five if

92
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,599
necessary will be also a little looser

93
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,360
on time than we have been in the past

94
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,599
although we still will put up the timer

95
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,959
as usual

96
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,959
um one change here is on slot nine uh

97
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,840
reza will be

98
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,959
um presenting versus shusang who was

99
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,760
originally listed

100
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,159
next

101
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,239
so this is our usual

102
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,159
discussion about working remote i think

103
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,399
everyone is really familiar with that we

104
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,720
are working remote and continue to do so

105
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,918
um that uh the mail list is how the

106
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,800
working group judges consensus uh these

107
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,639
discussions are very important that

108
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,199
we're having right now our periodic

109
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,040
informal meetings as well as interims

110
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,800
are hugely important

111
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,600
but it's really we gauge consensus on

112
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,040
the list

113
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,320
and

114
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,840
it's important when we're trying to

115
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,680
basically close down on a topic to show

116
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,199
that we're done with it it's also

117
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,120
equally important when we start new

118
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,840
discussions so if you have a new idea or

119
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,600
a new document that you want to get in

120
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,520
front of the group the mail list is the

121
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,360
right place to introduce it publish your

122
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
document send some intro

123
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,639
uh an intro summary to the list and try

124
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,479
to generate some discussion there that's

125
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,080
it's just as important to do that at the

126
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,560
beginning as it is at the end

127
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,039
our online meetings continue

128
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,280
it seems that for the next meeting we

129
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,280
have hope of maybe doing

130
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,680
um a mixed meeting of online and uh in

131
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,919
person we'll see what happens um that

132
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,919
has not been announced yet

133
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,800
but stay tuned uh but the uh we have the

134
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,759
the

135
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,960
ability to do um informal as well as

136
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,560
interim meetings

137
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,320
if you would like a

138
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,080
periodic webex as some groups have done

139
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,160
just ask the chairs and we'll set it up

140
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,160
for slow just remind us

141
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,320
hopefully our secretary that edition of

142
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,520
the secretary will make that a little

143
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,360
bit smoother

144
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,240
we also can do interims and meet echo is

145
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,759
now available on interim said it's great

146
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,560
for that next

147
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,520
as a reminder we have an ipr disclosure

148
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,360
process to

149
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,880
check to sort of um help us in that

150
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,039
process we referred back to and well

151
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,080
where we ask everyone to disclose any

152
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,639
ipr that their intellectual property

153
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,600
that they are um

154
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,440
they know about in work that they are

155
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,600
contributing on and um we pull

156
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,720
both um at the beginning of the process

157
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,199
on adoption as well as

158
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,610
um

159
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,160
[Music]

160
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
at the last call step and you see we

161
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,080
just started one today

162
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,680
uh as you add new authors we think it's

163
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
really important to

164
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,080
um

165
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,880
get a polled response from that person

166
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,120
or even an unsolicited response from

167
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,759
that person uh this is only applies to

168
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,440
working group documents

169
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,680
and if you are an author or an editor

170
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,400
and you add someone we really ask you to

171
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
have that person make an explicit

172
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,160
statement on the list at the time they

173
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,919
are added um we did have a surprise ipr

174
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,199
ipr

175
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,440
disclosure on someone who was added and

176
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,919
didn't disclose and and

177
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,120
you know it's sort of not fair to the

178
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,880
working group to have such a late itr

179
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,680
dysfunction next

180
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,520
so what's new with our documents um we

181
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,120
have no new rfcs and nothing in the

182
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,560
editor queue we'll have to try to speed

183
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
up and get some new things in there uh

184
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,039
we do have a batch of um documents that

185
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,720
are headed to last call so you know i

186
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,319
think that we're gonna fill the queue

187
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,199
again

188
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,680
um not sure why that formatting came out

189
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,199
strange but we have one document in

190
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,759
publication requested i believe that is

191
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,479
with our a d there was an update issued

192
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,000
um so it was with the authors but i

193
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,560
think it's now back with the aed

194
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,039
and we've had one recent adoption

195
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,360
next

196
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,400
there was one liaison received um

197
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,039
excuse me uh it's from gsma i don't know

198
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,800
if that's actually a formal liaison or a

199
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,160
communication tsma is part of 3gpp so

200
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,639
i'm not i'll defer to the iab and what

201
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,080
their liaison or communication

202
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,800
relationship is but we do have one um

203
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,520
new white paper available uh

204
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,120
please review it um if we uh we have

205
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,800
some working group documents in this

206
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,080
area now on itf network slicing it may

207
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
be time to

208
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,400
send a response and so if you're

209

uh before i start with

230
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,000
the working group document status let me

231
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,040
thank

232
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,440
our new secretary lewis for

233
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,839
proactively collating the status reports

234
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,120
and compiling the slide deck

235
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,040
we there are 22 working group documents

236
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,480
that are listed here

237
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,040
uh five of those colored in blue or on

238
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,560
the agenda today

239
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,920
um we have one document um the signaling

240
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,080
extension staff for some pivot for which

241
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,399
we put in a publication request a while

242
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,560
back lou went over the status of that in

243
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,000
the previous text so it's not covered

244
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,200
here so that leaves us with

245
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,680
16 documents the status for each of

246
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,160
those is covered in this deck

247
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,000
i don't intend to walk through each and

248
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,519
every one of those here

249
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,880
um i

250
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,240
will um however double click on a select

251
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,560
view and dwell on them a little bit uh

252
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,920
for the rest of them you can use your

253
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,440
own page go through the slides and the

254
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,200
reports that are sent out to the list

255
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,839
and ask questions if any

256
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,040
so let me jump to slide six first

257
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,279
so this is uh the enhanced vpn framework

258
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,800
document

259
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,720
a new revision for this was published in

260
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,040
late october um

261
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,519
there is uh some new text describing in

262
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,000
detail the applicability of enhanced vpn

263
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,600
to network slicing

264
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,880
um as part of the next steps the authors

265
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,040
have indicated that they would

266
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,320
like to

267
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,880
sort out the relationship between ns vpn

268
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,279
and itf network slice

269
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,959
from the chairs point of view this is a

270
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,800
topic that has been discussed on the

271
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,920
list before

272
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,040
and as noted in the ietf network slices

273
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,240
framework document um enhanced vpn does

274
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,480
offer one solution approach to realize

275
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,399
idf network slices

276
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,519
uh as noted in that document and also on

277
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,920
the list it is not the only solution

278
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,160
approach for realizing idf network

279
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,880
slices so if there is um a specific

280
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,399
question that the authors are looking to

281
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,399
get answer for the from the working

282
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,600
group uh regarding this relationship um

283
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,360
uh please do initiate a thread on this

284
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,880
on the mailing list

285
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,160
like lou mentioned we also do have some

286
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,800
time towards the end of the sec second

287
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,560
session today

288
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,720
set aside for open discussion so the

289
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
authors could possibly leverage some

290
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,480
amount of that time for discussing this

291
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,079
let me

292
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,519
jump to slide 8.

293
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,040
this is the pc cc use cases document

294
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
as stated in the previous meeting the

295
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,920
chairs have decided to take this to last

296
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,880
call

297
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,560
um it seems like there are still a

298
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,800
couple of items pending uh

299
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,480
the authors have indicated that they

300
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,399
would be wrapping this up soon so please

301
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,200
do

302
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,000
review this in anticipation of last call

303
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,839
um this is

304
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,200
uh the 3272 bis document

305
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,160
a new revision for this was published uh

306
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,600
yesterday

307
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,200
the ada's notes suggest that there are

308
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,560
still

309
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,480
a couple of pending items

310
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,240
there is still this open question on

311
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,760
whether the scope

312
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,360
needs to change

313
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,480
from

314
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,160
overview and principles of internet

315
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,600

316
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,160
principles of traffic engineering um as

317
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,320
adrian says here there has been silence

318
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,480

document

323

could definitely use some thorough

324
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,120
reviews

325
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,279

338
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,680
almost done with this

339
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,600

review for this

341
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,279
we did initiate the review yesterday

342
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,120
hopefully that will get done in the next

343
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,720
few weeks

344
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,079
um let me jump to uh i think that's

345
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,040
slide 17.

346
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,760
so this is the base t young document the

347
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,600
authors have requested working glass

348
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,560
call

349
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,560
the initial plan was to progress this

350
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,040
document and three other documents

351
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,600
the rsvp young document the rsvp young

352
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,639
and the key mpls young document together

353
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,360
but

354
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,040
there are still some minor issues open

355
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,639
against the other three

356
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,720
so the plan is to initiate the working

357
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,560
group last call process for this

358
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,240
document first and let the other three

359
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,880
follow soon the ipr for this just got

360
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,279
started um so please do review all these

361
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,120
documents in anticipation of the last

362
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,000
call

363
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,440
um so

364
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,720
those are the items that we wanted to

365
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,560
cover as part of this deck

366
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,519
um

367
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,199
there are any on

368
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,399
on that document one of the authors is

369
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,079
mail is bouncing so co-authors um please

370
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:36,880
check

371
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,279
that all the authors addresses are right

372
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,600
and contributor addresses are right

373
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,079
um thank you acknowledged

374
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,440
um so yeah if there are any questions on

375
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,680
the status of the documents that i went

376
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,160
over or uh or for any other working

377
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,839
group document

378
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:56,800
you can

379
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,959
post that question now or or we could

380
00:14:58,959 --> 00:14:59,760
use

381
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,639
the discussion time later

382
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,519
i don't see anybody jumping onto the mic

383
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,160
so i can we can proceed to the next

384
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,519
presentation

385
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,560
i believe that's true

386
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,519
yeah thanks bubble

387
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,079
give me one second

388
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,360
correct so

389
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,680
yeah thanks uh hi everyone i'll be

390
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,839
discussing an update to a bunch of yang

391
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,199
models that i'm the editor on so next

392
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,040
slide please

393
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,440
so the set of models that we have today

394
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,720
is the vn model the two models which are

395
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
telemetry related which augments the

396
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,560
idft and itfvn with telemetry details

397
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,480
and then we have a set of models which

398
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,040
are service mapping models which map

399
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,639
uh the services uh the vpn services and

400
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,399
the

401
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,440
models

402
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,720
so let's go update one by one next slide

403
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,839
we will

404
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,720
focus on vn model

405
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,079
next slide

406
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,720
so an update to what is vn model vn

407
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,240
model is basically our yang model for

408
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,839
vn operations it is the customer view

409
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,079
of the virtual network uh it is an

410
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,120
abstraction over the t topology and the

411
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,199
t tunnel model it has a tight coupling

412
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,600
with those models it uses the

413
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,519
connectivity matrix to

414
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,480
uh

415
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,199
to describe how the vm

416
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,759
interact that is how the various

417
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,800
vn members and the access points uh come

418
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,959
together to form the vm

419
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,839
so the update in the latest model uh the

420
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,279
recent changes next slide

421
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,759
let me go through them uh so the main

422
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,320
change was there was a request to uh

423
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,000
like you know clean up our names i think

424
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,320
this was common in bunch of tea models

425
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,440
so as uh as the same operation was done

426
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,119
for itfte and and other models we also

427
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,280
take look it up for

428
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,119
the vm model and we have resolved the

429
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,400
naming issue

430
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,240
thanks to tom patch and other people who

431
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,119
have pointed out this issue the another

432
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,280
major update is we have added an empty

433
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,520
container for underlay as i was

434
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,760
mentioning earlier currently we have a

435
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,640
quite a tight coupling with te topology

436
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,880
model so we have added this empty

437
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,520
container underlay in a hope that any

438
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,240
future update can be made very easily a

439
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,320
future augmentation can be done for this

440
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,480
model to add things which cannot be

441
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,320
covered by the topology model for

442
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,240
example if you want to add details about

443
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,640
sr policy etc that can be an

444
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
augmentation of this model and the place

445
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,960
to augment that detail would be this

446
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,760
empty container called underlay

447
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,080
so this is uh

448
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,080
another update that we have done and

449
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,320
discussing one way to handle the

450
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,400
discussion that we had when last this

451
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,640
was presented that how do we handle this

452
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,200
issue so right now to keep the scope of

453
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,919
the

454
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,080
this draft limited uh

455
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,600
we thought that this could be a good

456
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,440
approach that we handle what is already

457
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,960
published let's

458
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,440
let's finish this and allow a way for

459
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,520
this to be augmented in a future in a

460
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,600
very clear way so have an empty

461
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
container for now which can be augmented

462
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,559
by a future model

463
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,640
we updated a description for v and

464
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,200
compute status we

465
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,240
we were reusing this from the t types

466
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,200
but it was not uh a one-to-one map there

467
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,960
was little bit description needs to be

468
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,280
added that how a t compute is little

469
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,039
different from vm compute so we have

470
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,440
added that though we are still reusing

471
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,360
it but we have added a description

472
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,679
saying how we expect this to be used in

473
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,280
the vm model

474
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,760
uh there was an update there was a

475
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,320
request to add cos as an additional

476
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,640
constraint we have added that and then

477
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,799
there was a major update with respect to

478
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,520
the json example since the topology

479
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,840
model had quite a bit of change uh

480
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,160
during the last few cycle and we were

481
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
still using the json example which was

482
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,400
written based on an older version of the

483
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,480
t topology model so based on that change

484
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,880
there was a pretty big update on the

485
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,960
json example that is there in the

486
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,160
document so these covers all the recent

487
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,400
changes that were made uh in the last

488
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,440
couple of updates next slide

489
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,280
we wanted to ask the working group are

490
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,960
these changes okay

491
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,000
uh do people have any other open issues

492
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,480
and we believe that if once these are

493
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,799
handled maybe we can consider this

494
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,720
document in pipeline for working group

495
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,200
last call the young doctor review was

496
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
done some time back

497
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,960
on version 10.

498
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,760
uh

499
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,360
we can see if we need to repeat that

500
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,120
again anyway it will be done as a part

501
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,760
of the last call process anyways so this

502
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,919
is my status thank you

503
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,919
uh we have we have lou in the queue

504
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,480
um i i looked at the cos change and

505
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,720
there's no context for it so it's not

506
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,400
immediately clear how you expect it to

507
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,960
be used so i think there's needs to be a

508
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,559
little more language around it

509
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,679
that's it

510
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,360
so

511
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,400
it's called cos but uh i i thought i saw

512
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,120
you

513
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,840
use the

514
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,600
dst class type is that is that what is

515
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,000
being done here

516
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,559
it's a fee you're just picking uh

517
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,960
the dst class type zero to seven value

518
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,400
between zero seven is that what is being

519
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,039
done yes okay yeah i'm using the t types

520
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,760
class itself not defining anything new

521
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,679
right so i think some description of how

522
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,000
you expect this to be used is needed

523
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,600
yeah that i think that makes sense i

524
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,120
will i will take in fact help from

525
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,120
kenichi itself since it's coming a

526
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,720
requirement from an operator so the best

527
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,159
is like you know he himself can describe

528
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,240
how we expect this to be used yeah just

529
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,000
drop it in the description and we'll be

530
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,960
good

531
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
yeah thank you thank you

532
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,200
yeah the use of empty container for

533
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,919
something um to make it future proof

534
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,120
that's

535
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,559
interesting like we do need

536
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,240
people to review and see if that is the

537
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,880
right approach

538
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,360
sure

539
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,919
okay so i think let's move on to the

540
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,200
next uh models so next we have telemetry

541
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,400
uh yang model next slide please uh in

542
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,799
this model we basically have the

543
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,880
performance monitoring parameters we

544
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,960
also have something what we call as a

545
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,280
scaling intent mechanism

546
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,320
where we tell at what time the capacity

547
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,200
for our vn or tunnels can be increased

548
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,159
and by how much

549
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,039
so

550
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,039
basically this model allows

551
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,520
any customer to subscribe to various

552
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,240
monitor monitoring performance

553
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,600
parameters

554
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,400
for a particular tunnel or a vm and also

555
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,240
to define the uh the scaling intent

556
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,799
so the update in this model

557
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,400
uh next slide

558
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
uh basically we handle comments from

559
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,200
adrian and greg thank you for those

560
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,600
uh the major update was we removed the

561
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,480
term kpi uh i think it was

562
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,320
i agreed that it was not so useful we

563
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,080
let's call it telemetry model and keep

564
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,120
it simple

565
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,679
uh we updated the figures to depict the

566
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,520
model relationship there was still some

567
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,000
confusion that are we redefining things

568
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,480
or are we reusing between the two models

569
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,280
so we have updated that description so

570
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,240
that the

571
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,799
readers is well aware of our intent with

572
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,480
respect to the relationship between the

573
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,520
models

574
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,360
we added an example

575
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,600
for how the scaling would be done with

576
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,080
help of xml example

577
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,880
and as usual adrian gave a lot of useful

578
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,960
suggestions and nits and i hope all

579
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,360
those have been handled

580
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,320
we have comments from greg regarding not

581
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,799
to use the word proactive uh when we are

582
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,120
talking about re-optimization we had a

583
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,799
back-and-forth discussion on the list

584
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,320
but i think it's

585
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,640
better to avoid the term in so we have

586
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,200
removed the pro the word proactive and i

587
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,520
think we have anyway described how the

588
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,080
model is tend to be used without without

589
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,840
using the term proactive

590
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,120
there was also a comment whether how it

591
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,679
links with other work such as one which

592
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,600
is happening in ops area

593
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,679
related to vpn service performance

594
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,720
measurement so we have added that how we

595
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,880
assume that like no these two work can

596
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,440
work together that you can have a vpn

597
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,960
overlay pm as well as you can have uh

598
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,280
traffic engineering uh telemetry data

599
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,440
and how both of them can be reused uh

600
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,919
used together and correlated when

601
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,559
looking for fault etc

602
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,720
we have also updated the security

603
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,200
consideration which was kind of lacking

604
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,240
so that's all the update for this model

605
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,080
there was one comment from adrian which

606
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,480
i think uh

607
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,919
which is in the next step next slide

608
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,360
uh that is

609
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,880
since we are talking about scaling

610
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,799
intent and there is some overlap with

611
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,279
the work that's happening in ops area so

612
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,640
there should be like you know

613
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,480
notification sent to them

614
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,240
so our

615
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,080
query was that should we send it as

616
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,000
authors or is it better if it goes from

617
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,320
chairs

618
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,200
yeah we yeah we can definitely um

619
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,600
send it uh there is i mean we haven't

620
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,400
done

621
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,320
a young doctor's review

622
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,640
for this document yet right

623
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,720
yes so i think we can initiate that

624
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,400
review and as

625
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,200
as part of that also

626
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,360
take care of reviews from other working

627
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,720
groups

628
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,279
uh i think the main point with op series

629
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,840
i think this intent word is also like

630
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,520
today in the ops area again this

631
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,440
discussion was happening and earlier

632
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,799
also we have the ad being this

633
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,039
discussion whether the terminology map

634
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,240
so i think

635
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,480
just a quick idea of what we are doing

636
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,080
uh it's not just the modeling part but

637
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,320
the terminology that might be a good

638
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,158
input to get from the ops area as well

639
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,159
so keep in mind the

640
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,080
the

641
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,919
i want to call it the nib doctor sorry

642
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,000
yang doctor review

643
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
includes the 80s in the ops area

644
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,240
so they they can chime in whether we'll

645
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,080
need a broader review

646
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,439
okay that makes sense

647
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,799
um tariq

648
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,080
does this telemetry model cover the uh

649
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,200
the service uh telemetry as well as the

650
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,760
transport underlay or is it just the

651
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,000
transport

652
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,400
it's just the transport just the te and

653
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,600
vn

654
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,840
uh and as as i was mentioning that it's

655
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,760
in fact the vpn service young model

656
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,799
where we expect the service telemetry to

657
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,400
be there

658
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,159
as well as like network slicing for

659
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,279
example

660
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,919
yeah so network slicing is not covered

661
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,120
in this

662
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,918
okay thanks

663
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,679
okay so uh

664
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,080
the final draft for me the t service

665
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,360
mapping model

666
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,120
now this model uh basically maps the

667
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,919
services and the networks various l3 sm

668
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,480
l2 sm and even l1 csm and also the

669
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,760
network models like l3m and l2nm how do

670
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,240
they map with the te infrastructure so

671
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,480
mapping to t toppo e tunnel uh vn etc so

672
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,200
all of this uh is handled in this model

673
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,679
uh idea of this model is so that we

674
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,320
could have a seamless service operations

675
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,440
and understand how the service is

676
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,159
being run on our underlay t network and

677
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,919
what is the relationship between the two

678
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,400
this allows us to do monitoring and

679
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,200
diagnostic much much better and it also

680
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,120
supports various type different types of

681
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,240
map types that is what is the

682
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,880
relationship between the service and pe

683
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,200
there could be multiple tight coupling

684
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
or it could be loose so those different

685
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,640
map types

686
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,600
are supported in this model

687
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,559
so the recent changes in the next slide

688
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,679
the recent changes uh because there were

689
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,880
inputs from adrian oscar kenichi

690
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,200
and based on that what we have done is

691
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,360
we have added a clear section on what is

692
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,120
the purpose of this service mapping so

693
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,679
and where we intend this to be used one

694
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,520
thing that we did clarify that this will

695
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,559
be useful for an outside entity only if

696
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,360
the

697
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,080
outside entity also understand

698
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,480
for instance vn and tunnel otherwise

699
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,320
this model would be more

700
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,320
for internal purposes for the network

701
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,480
itself mostly for diagnostic and

702
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,960
monitoring purposes and not might not be

703
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,279
exposed to the outside world so both of

704
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,000
these are valid approaches like if the t

705
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,120
topology and p tunnels are exposed then

706
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,919
uh

707
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,600
this mapping could be useful by an

708
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,200
external system

709
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,960
otherwise it's only for internal

710
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,440
purposes there were bunch of things

711
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,159
which were marked as open issues uh and

712
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,640
thanks for adrian for pushing us and

713
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,640
giving us good solutions on how to

714
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,799
handle it so we have kind of marked that

715
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,840
scheduling is not out uh not part of

716
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,240
this draft but how it could be handled

717
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,200
the those texts has been added uh one

718
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,679
more open issue was how do we map

719
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,960
traffic

720
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,840
onto this particular services and our t

721
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,679
infrastructure so we have said that this

722
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,000
is out of scope there is some discussion

723
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,360
we know that this is happening uh

724
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,080
in other young model one early attempt

725
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,799
that we did also exist with respect to

726
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,399
this document which i've mentioned this

727
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,039
is t traffic yang which tries to say

728
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,000
that how we can maybe use acl and

729
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,960
like even flow spec kind of information

730
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,000
uh to

731
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,720
uh to do this is again very early work

732
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,399
but anyway from the scope of this

733
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,080
document we are saying it is out of

734
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,399
scope somewhere somewhere else this

735
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,919
needs to be handled so if there is an

736
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,880
interest in this area and

737
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,559
like you know please reach out to me as

738
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,600
well

739
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,840
uh next steps in the next slide

740
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,200
uh itf network slice is out of scope so

741
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,120
we wanted to check whether that's a good

742
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,000
approach do we need to add it as one of

743
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,080
the other possible

744
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
service types like if we are already

745
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,799
handling l3 sml and others should we

746
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,640
also map itf networks slice to te

747
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,200
resources is this the right way to do it

748
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,080
or

749
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,520
should something else is needed so this

750
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,279
is an open question

751
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,799
to the working group if people have

752
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,039
thoughts on it please

753
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,440
tell us now or on the list

754
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,760
and one more request was that if you can

755
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,159
add more examples of how this model

756
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,559
could be used

757
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,919
in various different scenarios

758
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,840
especially covering all the section that

759
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,080
we added about purpose of this document

760
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,320
so if we can add different scenarios

761
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,480
where this model could be used so we are

762
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,000
planning to add a little bit more

763
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,600
examples in this

764
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,840
document so those are the two next steps

765
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840
and if people have any other open issues

766
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,000
or thought on the itf network slice part

767
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,880
please let us

768
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,600
so on the

769
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,960
network slice part

770
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,880
i think we can proceed without it and

771
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,200
then we can always if necessary augment

772
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,480
the model and that way we don't have to

773
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,640
hold up this document which is hopefully

774
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,039
getting pretty mature at this point

775
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,039
and if we tried to bring in slicing that

776
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,960
i think that would cause a large delay

777
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,919
in this

778
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,279
as far as i can tell there's no reason

779
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,279
why it can't just be done as a

780
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,360
standalone document an augment if we do

781
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,960
need to augment

782
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,159
um

783
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,000
i think that's our perspective

784
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,120
from the chair

785
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,600
outside if anyone wants to

786
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,200
give an alternate view

787
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,159
now would be a good time

788
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,000
dhruv does that do you think that works

789
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,679
for the authors

790
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,679
uh yeah let me just discuss with my

791
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,600
author set as well and see what they

792
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,320
feel we are dependent on couple of

793
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,000
models still like l1 csm uh is one of

794
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,039
them there is sr policy so uh though our

795
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,440
t part uh is going well

796
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,760
and uh those models are all like i t f t

797
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,080
e i t f t top are all progressing but on

798
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,600
the other side we have progress on l3 nm

799
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,399
uh l2 nm is also progressing so i think

800
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,760
l1 csm and sr policy those are the two

801
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,399
models which we are dependent on so we

802
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,320
might have a little bit more time

803
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,440
uh while this document would be ready to

804
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,440
publish in rfc

805
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,120
but those changes are not likely to

806
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,559
change the content of this document

807
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,039
correct yeah that's true well if we sat

808
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,960
in miss ref it wouldn't be a big deal we

809
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,480
could just wait until those are go

810
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,919
through the process

811
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,039
yeah

812
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,600
okay uh yeah i think i think if we could

813
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,240
wrap this up and you know start going

814
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,159
through the publication process

815
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,480
uh it would be better to do that than to

816
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,240
try to hold it indefinitely or hold it

817
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,919
much longer

818
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,440
i also had a comment on the prior slide

819
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,799
so um you've added two very small

820
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,399
sections on

821
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,240
things that are out of scope

822
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,200
um i i found those to be really

823
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,080
um

824
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,760
not clear what you're saying and the

825
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,039
nice thing is though is they're out of

826
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,919
scope and um you know many documents

827
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,440
just are silent on things that are out

828
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,679
of scope so would you be opposed just to

829
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,600
dropping those two sections

830
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,000
um or do you think we at paragraphs i'm

831
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,919
sorry not sections paragraphs which just

832
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,360
came in the last version

833
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,799
uh or do you think we really have to

834
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,559
state that it's explicitly out of scope

835
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,519
i think uh the main reason why was there

836
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,519
these were the questions that were asked

837
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,159
to the authors uh and that's why we were

838
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,399
maintaining them as an open issues and

839
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,720
people had this idea that oh without

840
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,200
these things handled uh is this mapping

841
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,320
useful

842
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,440
uh

843
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,519
so mainly because of that we wanted to

844
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,039
give it a little bit more importance i

845
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,360
think the text came from adrian if i'm

846
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,679
not uh wrong at least related to

847
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:12,799
scheduling

848
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,600
so i can discuss with adrian and post it

849
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,880
to the working group and see what the

850
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,480
working group thinks whether we need to

851
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,039
keep it or remove it

852
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,840
well here's your h and

853
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,480
eq

854
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,440
yeah

855
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,919
yeah so my my question

856
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,120
was really just to the authors to say

857
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,600
have you deliberately left this out

858
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,799
uh and

859
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,880
it's fine in my opinion that they've

860
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,559
deliberately left it out and their

861
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,000
answer

862
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,399
uh closed that for me

863
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,799
uh you might wonder what will happen

864
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,240
when the next person reviews the

865
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,760
document and and whether having this

866
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,240
paragraph will just even reduce it to a

867
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,760
sentence

868
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,840
would help the reviewer the next

869
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,519
reviewer not also ask the question but

870
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,480
it's

871
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,640
it's pretty unimportant to them

872
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,799
yeah and i'm worried about declaring

873
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,480
things out of scope when someone comes

874
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,000
along and wants to augment the document

875
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,760
that someone will use that statement

876
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,839
about it being out of scope as saying

877
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,440
that you can't augment the document and

878
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,040
i don't think that's what's intended

879
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,839
here

880
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,719
um and i i just find that you know

881
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,839
unless it's

882
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,359
it really seems that something should be

883
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,119
in the scope of the document it's better

884
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,159
just to be silent on it

885
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,040
in this case in fact we say that in

886
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,599
future augmentation you should do that

887
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,760
so i think let's report this so what's

888
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,079
the point

889
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,040
and actually the next paragraph is

890
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,719
really the one i think is problematic

891
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,119
but um

892
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,040
i i think in practice it's better just

893
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,560
to be quiet on things that are out of

894
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,599
scope

895
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,679
if you'd like you know i think talking

896
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,918
it to your authors about the

897
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,159
uh other paragraph and whether or not

898
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,240
you you're comfortable just being quiet

899
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,119
there

900
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,560
um you know adding one sentence um

901
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,960
you know currently on out of scope

902
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,240
you know and then you say although they

903
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,760
could use their own scheduling mechanism

904
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,960
i don't think this is adding i think

905
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,880
it's opening a door that's not really

906
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,280
clear i i really don't think the other

907
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,440
scope statements are adding anything

908
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,000
but i'm also happy to take that as a

909
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,320
uh you know as a contributor position um

910
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,720
as chair uh definitely think it's bad

911
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,720
practice to put out a scope statements

912
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,680
unless you really need to um but as uh

913
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,880
you know for these two pic two

914
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,480
particular ones i'm happy to take it to

915
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,599
the list and

916
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,720
pursue it as a contributor

917
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,280
that's all from my side thank you

918
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,839
thanks drew

919
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,720
adrian

920
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,200
we're just waiting for oh here we go set

921
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,400
aside so

922
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
uh you're gonna fly are you rather than

923
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,119
me all right

924
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,879
um

925
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,040
so so flip back a slide please um

926
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,599
i just want to to start

927
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,440
do you prefer to try i don't mind i

928
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,599
don't yeah um i

929
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,720
i

930
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,880
um just want to start by thanking

931
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,280
everyone that's been involved

932
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,440
because although it's my name on the

933
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,320
front page it's not really my work so

934
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,720
much so this is all the

935
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,480
people who were in the design team who

936
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,240
wrote the foundation documents

937
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,480
the people that came along to the

938
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,040
interim meeting and discussed it

939
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,079
uh and many people who've contributed on

940
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,720
the mailing list to move

941
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,640
the work forward so next slide

942
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,480
what we have in uh the fairly recently

943
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,960
published uh 05

944
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,400
is uh an attempt to resolve the

945
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,200
uh open issues that were discussed at

946
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,960
the interim uh and had uh text proposals

947
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,200
on the table

948
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,400
and so um i run through these uh the

949
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,440
first one was connectivity matrices

950
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,720
uh and what we've done here is clarify

951
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,680
the definition of the four basic

952
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,599
connectivity matrices

953
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,680
and added a new matrix for any to any

954
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,599
connectivity

955
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,240
and the intention here

956
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,760
is to

957
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,960
enable

958
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,839
every type of um

959
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,520
use case

960
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,920
that people have been suggesting

961
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,119
chiefly

962
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,640
operators

963
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,599
um

964
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,400
the

965
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,640
general case is based on a

966
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,960
sort of tunnel connectivity

967
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,200
but we also wanted to support the vpn

968
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,359
type service and that's what brings in

969
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,880
any to any

970
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,640
which is not a tunnel connectivity it's

971
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,480
effectively a rootable

972
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,240
full mesh

973
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,920
so a little bit of discussion on that on

974
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,920
the next slide

975
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,000
on how we can handle every type of

976
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,480
service

977
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,880
does any to any make multi-point to

978
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,880
multi-point and multi-point to point

979
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,160
unnecessary and clearance new question

980
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,119
on slos in p2mp

981
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,040
before we get to that

982
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,480
the related issue was the question of

983
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,800
slos and sl's per

984
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,200
sender stroke receiver

985
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,800
and

986
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,240
that's

987
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,760
closely tied

988
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,800
so let's go to the next slide

989
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,680
so here are the types of connectivity

990
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,560
matrix that we've got defined

991
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,920
and i think

992
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,839
that point to point is pretty

993
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:00,400
straightforward

994
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,960
it's um a pair of

995
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,079
ces

996
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,160
with the traffic going from one to the

997
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,040
other

998
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,200
it behaves like a private wire or a

999
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,480
tunnel

1000
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,040
and the slos and sles are applied at the

1001
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,240
sender and so they're implicitly the

1002
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,240
same slos and sles at the receiver

1003
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,240
it would be very odd if they weren't

1004
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,280
uh the bi-directional version of that

1005
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,560
is really just a pairing

1006
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,520
and there's no implication of co-rooted

1007
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,000
or not co-rooted

1008
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,720
although i guess you could define an sle

1009
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,079
to to force that

1010
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,880
there are two sets of slos

1011
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,520
uh each applying to one of the ces as

1012
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,160
its sender

1013
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,520
so point to multipoint it just extends

1014
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,160
that really it's a single sender and

1015
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,280
multiple receivers and it behaves like a

1016
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,440
point to multi-point tunnel or a

1017
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,520
multi-access vlan

1018
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,280
segment

1019
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,920
there is one set of slos and sles that

1020
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,680
apply at the sender

1021
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,160
and therefore implicitly at all

1022
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,000
receivers because all the traffic is

1023
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
going from the one sender to all the

1024
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,560
receivers

1025
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,720
so far so good

1026
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,760
then we get the multi-point to point

1027
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,200
um which is something that we've sort of

1028
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,359
seen in a um

1029
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,400
an ldp sense and then got added to

1030
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,720
rsvpte

1031
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,720
for for mpls

1032
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,839
um

1033
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,599
and what you have here is that all

1034
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,079
traffic that is injected at any sending

1035
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,040
cd

1036
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,640
is received by the single receiver

1037
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,640
so you could model this as a set of

1038
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,720
point-to-point connections with a common

1039
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,720
receiver

1040
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,560
uh each sending ce as it has its own set

1041
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,280
of slos and sles so

1042
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,040
um it's not a given that each sender on

1043
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,359
this matrix has the same

1044
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,839
uh traffic

1045
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,960
requirements and

1046
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,200
the

1047
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,640
implicit slos and sles for the receiving

1048
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,160
ce

1049
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
really are a combination of these

1050
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,359
sending slos and sles

1051
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,800
otherwise you wouldn't get all the

1052
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,680
traffic delivered

1053
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,520
so multi-point to multi-point is um

1054
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,240
is a bit ugly i i see turret in the

1055
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,160
queue but i'll finish the slide and then

1056
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,440
we'll come back um

1057
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,800
multi-point to multiple it's a little

1058
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,920
bit ugly in a tunnel sort of sense there

1059
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,480
are uh nces uh that can send traffic and

1060
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,440
that

1061
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,240
anything they send is delivered to all

1062
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,680
of the other ces

1063
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,280
each sending ce has its own set of slos

1064
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,560
and sles

1065
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,960
and the combination of those gives the

1066
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,599
implicit slos and sles for all of the

1067
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,240
receivers

1068
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,240
uh

1069
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,280
and then we hit the any to any and and

1070
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,880
this is different this is not

1071
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,400
tunnel-like

1072
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,280
here you have a set of ces and they may

1073
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,240
send to any of the other ces

1074
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,680
anyone

1075
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,800
or

1076
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,720
any set so they can support

1077
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,760
point-to-point and multicast

1078
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,640
um

1079
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,359
and it's not unlike the the multi-point

1080
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,760
to multi-point it isn't the case that a

1081
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,920
sender's traffic is delivered to all

1082
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,359
receivers

1083
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,359
so there's some implicit level of

1084
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,680
routing going on in this connectivity

1085
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,078
matrix that's not in the other ones

1086
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,640
the matrix

1087
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,480
must determine

1088
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,920
to which c's to deliver each packet so

1089
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,839
something has to be looked up to work

1090
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,200
that out

1091
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,760
and then the slo sles apply to

1092
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,520
individual senders

1093
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,839
are paired with their individual

1094
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,480
receivers so you can actually say this

1095
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,319
i'm going to send this sort of traffic

1096
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,000
from here to here

1097
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,280
and then that means there's no linkage

1098
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,640
between

1099
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,680
sender

1100
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,560
and receiver and a sender may be

1101
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,720
disappointed if a receiver is over

1102
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,960
subscribed

1103
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,440
so i'm not surprised this has caused a

1104
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,280
few hands to go up and i think we should

1105
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,280
try to clear them before we move on so

1106
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,680
terry

1107
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,599
adrian on

1108
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:32,960
on on

1109
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,359
jotting down the types of

1110
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,960
matrices connectivity matrices i

1111
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,560
um i want to start with the basic uh

1112
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,640
matrix point to point

1113
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,720
and um

1114
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,640
my question is we talk about a

1115
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,560
connectivity matrix and we talk about

1116
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,440
connections um

1117
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,880
in your view a a matrix can have

1118
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,960
multiple connections and and just to

1119
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,119
highlight that we're going to raise this

1120
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,960
topic up in the

1121
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,400
in the nbi uh network size mbi data

1122
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,440
model

1123
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,920
we did discuss it among the authors but

1124
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,520
i want to get your

1125
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,640
initial thoughts on this

1126
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,040
so um

1127
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,400
when you say we talk about connections

1128
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,680
uh i thought i had mopped all of that up

1129
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,680
out of the framework

1130
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,359
um i don't see it helpful

1131
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,520
to talk about connections and a

1132
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,839
connectivity matrix

1133
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,400
um

1134
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,960
i i do see it on your slide right now uh

1135
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,200
it could this is like set of p2p

1136
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,640
connections but

1137
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,079
i like it like like so so yeah that

1138
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,440
that's providing some kind of context to

1139
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,359
help understand what we're talking about

1140
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,880
um

1141
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,119
but

1142
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,359
so i'll give you more context on my

1143
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,680
question so if i have

1144
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,240
two network slice end points basic

1145
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,440
network slides with two end points

1146
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,560
and i want can connectivity between them

1147
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,720
will will i be ending up creating one

1148
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,200
connectivity matrix

1149
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,960
with two

1150
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,880
point-to-point connections or

1151
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,720
will i have two connectivity matrices uh

1152
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,079
where one

1153
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,280
uh in one of them the sender is uh you

1154
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,599
know one end point other and the other

1155
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,359
it's the other endpoint

1156
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,079
can can this be clarified

1157
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,880
yeah so uh let's uh let's put sort of

1158
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,560
names to that if you want to send

1159
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,319
traffic a to b

1160
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:45,119
and you want to send traffic a to c

1161
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,160
you have two matrices two point to point

1162
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,839
matrices

1163
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,839
um

1164
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,200
uh you're you're right my um

1165
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,160
my text in the multi-point point was

1166
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,560
sloppy it should say this is like a set

1167
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,680
of

1168
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,160
a set of p2p connectivity matrices

1169
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,760
yeah i find it awkward that matrix is

1170
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,280
usually

1171
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,800
made of multiple entries and your uh

1172
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,520
definition has only one entry but maybe

1173
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,640
other no no um everything's got more

1174
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,800
than one entry because

1175
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,400
um

1176
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,200
you're counting the ces

1177
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,319
but but point to point there's only one

1178
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,960
entry uh the way you well i hope not i

1179
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,480
hope there's a receiver as well as a

1180
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,400
sender

1181
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,079
no no

1182
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,480
so you list think about think of a list

1183
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,119
of ces for your whole

1184
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,319
network

1185
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:45,839
all of the edges

1186
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,079
and then each matrix you're going

1187
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,640
through and saying i'm connecting this

1188
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,640
set of ces

1189
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,480
and in the point-to-point case yes it's

1190
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,200
almost trivial but you you still have

1191
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,720
both ends

1192
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,599
of them

1193
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,680
so you have two ces in your matrix

1194
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,960
okay i mean

1195
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,319
this is the last thing i'm going to

1196
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,200
mention on this in the td topology model

1197
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,879
we use connectivity matrix

1198
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,920
an attempt to create such a mesh

1199
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,960
and and there there is a list of entries

1200
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,200
in one matrix

1201
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,160
and

1202
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,640
you know maybe we should uh talk about

1203
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,800
it offline or you know

1204
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,280
yeah we we should certainly try to get

1205
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,079
some

1206
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,319
either alignment between the use of

1207
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,440
terminology or um

1208
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,079
an intentional divergence

1209
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,079
um

1210
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,400
uh i'm fine with that uh

1211
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,680
this

1212
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,240
usage has been around for a couple of

1213
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,760
revisions so

1214
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,880
um

1215
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,079
it

1216
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,079
we might assume that it's it's been

1217
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,079
thought about a bit but um yeah let's

1218
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,640
get together and and try to resolve that

1219
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,880
tallest

1220
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,160
so um i think the the

1221
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,680
fundamentals here are point-to-point and

1222
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,359
point-to-multipoint and everything else

1223
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:08,240
is just a random subset of potentially

1224
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,800
interesting groupings right and maybe it

1225
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,119
would be very helpful to to just say

1226
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,960
that you know there needs to be the

1227
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,240
concept of groupings and

1228
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,240
these can still be listed there but

1229
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,000
obviously there there'll be other uh

1230
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,480
interesting ones you know i think we we

1231
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,960
have you know a redundant hub and spoke

1232
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,880
and i don't want to go through through

1233
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,839
the list but uh otherwise it looks like

1234
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,680
a long flat

1235
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,160
list um you know that that may become

1236
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,760
confusing

1237
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,599
so i i

1238
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,359
hear what you're saying uh but i think

1239
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,160
you need to step back and and this is

1240
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,720
from a service perspective

1241
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,680
so

1242
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,000
for example something like hub and spoke

1243
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,440
is about realization inside the network

1244
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,440
and the uh the the service

1245
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,440
may want to talk about that or the

1246
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,119
service user may want to talk about that

1247
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,520
but they have no real control over what

1248
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,640
the network is doing

1249
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,440
no no no i think for example uh

1250
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,240
a

1251
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,800
set of point-to-point uh

1252
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,720
where um one point uh is uh

1253
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,040
always the same um

1254
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,119
right a set of bi-directional pointer

1255
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,079
points

1256
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,000
with you know one point being the hub

1257
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,800
and the others all the spoke is exactly

1258
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,319
you know

1259
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,720
a grouping like like many of the others

1260
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,480
here like any to any or um

1261
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,319
or multi-point to multi-point or so

1262
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,800
right so happen spoke is in the same

1263
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,200
is in the same bucket as a as a type of

1264
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,640
connectivity matrix

1265
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,119
you have n plus one nodes n of them can

1266
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,680
only send to the plus one and the plus

1267
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,160
one can send to any of the n

1268
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,240
same thing right so just as an example

1269
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,800
of how you can extend this list

1270
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,000
so

1271
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,400
if they if that if the hub

1272
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,920
is a uh a customer site

1273
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,839
that is very different from if the hub

1274
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,480
is inside the network yeah and i'm i

1275
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,960
think here we're only talking about the

1276
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,800
customer side and so of course my

1277
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,880
example then also only talks about

1278
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,480
customer sites

1279
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,240
right so uh we we had and i think we've

1280
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,559
removed a paragraph that actually told

1281
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,440
you how to make a hub and spoke

1282
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,359
using the customer site

1283
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,280
um

1284
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,760
by building that out of um

1285
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,200
multi-point to point and a set of uh

1286
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,480
point to points but um we can we can

1287
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,000
revisit that um you know but i i just

1288
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,599
wanted to make one example there are

1289
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,920
more examples in the same way as you

1290
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,040
removed the the uh the happened spoke

1291
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,400
you can equally remove the

1292
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,640
bi-directional point-to-point if you do

1293
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,800
have the concept that

1294
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,119
the customer can request a connectivity

1295
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,559
matrix of a set of fundamentals like a

1296
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:08,440
set of p2p and p2mp with a common policy

1297
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,400
then all these these others uh

1298
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,319
bidirectional multi-pointer point

1299
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,400
multi-pointer multi-point a to a are

1300
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,280
just creations out of here is a set of

1301
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,680
fundamentals like a set of p2p and i

1302
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,359
want to have this set and a common

1303
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,200
policy

1304
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,119
and then we don't need to argue whether

1305
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,880
a bidirectional p2p has you know is so

1306
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,119
much more important to be listed whereas

1307
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,079
happenspoke is not listed

1308
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,200
okay gotcha

1309
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,720
let's take uh three hari

1310
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,280
uh and then move on with other slides oh

1311
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,280
we'll lose in the queue as well three

1312
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,559
hurry

1313
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,640
sure so i might have a question very

1314
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,920
similar to what tourist was talking

1315
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,839
about let me just uh ask the question

1316
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,559
and then you can defer to uh same answer

1317
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,720
what i'm struggling with is uh let's say

1318
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,359
take a multi-pointer point example

1319
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,079
where the receiving ces slo is

1320
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,640
implicitly derived from the multiple

1321
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,079
senders

1322
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,400
what i am thinking maybe you can correct

1323
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,720
me if i am receiving this if i am the

1324
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,160
receiver ce

1325
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,800
then i get to define and because i'm

1326
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,800
paying for the you know service so i get

1327
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,359
to define what slos do i need and

1328
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,559
therefore implicitly all the senders slo

1329
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,880
should be derived is what i'm thinking

1330
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,680
care to comment on it

1331
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,119
i i think we want to facilitate that

1332
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,240
but i'm i'm not sure we want to

1333
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,558
constrain to it does that make sense

1334
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,720
but as of now you're trying to

1335
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,040
implicitly derive the receivers

1336
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,160
receiving ce's slo from the senders

1337
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,079
is that the only option or can we do the

1338
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,880
also the opposite

1339
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,720
yeah we could i guess we could uh so far

1340
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,920
we've not

1341
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,880
until we get to any to any we've not

1342
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,720
specified the slos for the receiver

1343
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,680
uh but i i'd be interested to hear if

1344
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,960
people have got

1345
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,880
sort of like um

1346
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,200
operator use cases where they need to

1347
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,680
specify the receiver's slo

1348
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,319
on on a pipe model as different from the

1349
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,319
sender

1350
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,839
mr harry went quiet so i guess

1351
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:43,040
lou okay yeah i wasn't sure what

1352
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,280
happened there um

1353
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,240
go ahead

1354
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,680
i'll wait for i'll wait for more

1355
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,079
comments yeah i'll just my comment there

1356
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,319
yeah

1357
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,520
all right um so i'd like to go back to

1358
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,920
uh how many sort of external

1359
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,800
uh services are exposed i

1360
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,119
we have been through whether or not

1361
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,880
bi-directional as a special case of

1362
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,000
point-to-point

1363
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,280
uh bi-directional point-to-point is a

1364
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,520
special case of unidirectional and we

1365
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,200
have gone through that discussion so

1366
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,880
many times and every time at the end we

1367
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,640
come back and say yeah bi-directional is

1368
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,040
important to call out separately so

1369
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:19,920
um

1370
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,720
i'd like to propose that we keep that in

1371
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,559
um you know there's been lots of times

1372
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,280
where that is a important provisioned

1373
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,440
service or port service to deliver to a

1374
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,280
user

1375
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,319
some of the others i think it's how you

1376
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:37,599
construct your matrix and if you see a

1377
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:40,720
matrix as a set of items then

1378
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,240
you certainly could build some of the

1379
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,839
lower three out of the top three i think

1380
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:49,520
although i'm not a 100 sure on what a2a

1381
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,680
means other than maybe a uh

1382
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,480
a

1383
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,000
a slacker slo or sle

1384
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,720
thanks that's it

1385
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,240
uh i guess we keep going on um on this

1386
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,359
slide uh if the chairs are happy that we

1387
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,440
that i gobble up some of the spare time

1388
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,680
at the end of the second session

1389
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,319
yeah so with uh chair hat on we very

1390
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,079
privately said we expect this slide to

1391
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:19,520
be the last slide of this session and

1392
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,040
then we'll do the rest of the slides at

1393
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,359
the start of the next session

1394
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,839
uh okay

1395
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,960
yeah that works whatever you want or we

1396
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,720
can take it at the end you choose uh

1397
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,440
okay lewis then

1398
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,160
yes just uh commenting on the cases that

1399
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,000
you you mentioned before about the need

1400
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,240
of uh having a split view of the

1401
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,640
receivers hello i think that because we

1402
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,880
are not explicitly describing the way in

1403
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,720
which we are distributing the content if

1404
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,040
it's unique or multicast

1405
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,359
uh could be the cases that if we go for

1406
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,359
a multicast or unicast this has an

1407
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:54,480
impact on the

1408
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,520
receiver side so this could be a case i

1409
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,319
think

1410
00:55:58,319 --> 00:55:59,359
thank you

1411
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,280
yeah so i think we need to look

1412
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:06,400
carefully at the uh the a to a

1413
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:12,799
matrix compared to say the p2mp matrix

1414
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,359
but i but i'm this comes back to the

1415
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:19,119
question that we had before is where

1416
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:23,200
does a2a make actually uh mp to p and mp

1417
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,200
to mp redundant

1418
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,119
and then actually i think you get

1419
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,640
everything you want through the a toa

1420
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:38,880
so i'm a little confused by the hands

1421
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,680
that are still up but i think uh wim is

1422
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,760
next

1423
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,160
yeah so uh i think thanks for doing the

1424
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,280
great work because this is not an easy

1425
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,960
an easy thing

1426
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,440
my main question the i that i have is

1427
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,799
the following with which is also as a

1428
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:57,040
follow-up question uh so the

1429
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,520
connectivity matrix in my view is mainly

1430
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,319
to help define uh the characteristics of

1431
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,480
the azolo and azales is that is my

1432
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,350
understanding correct

1433
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:08,319
[Music]

1434
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,480
yes sort of i mean

1435
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,040
consider yourself there uh

1436
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,799
requesting a slice service

1437
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,599
you need to say

1438
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:22,640
uh in some sense what traffic is going

1439
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,880
what the traffic demand is going to be

1440
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,400
i'm going to be sending traffic from

1441
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,559
here to here and this is how i want it

1442
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,799
to behave so it's yes it's a kind of an

1443
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:33,839
anchor for the slos but it's uh it's

1444
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:36,640
it's a little bit more than that yeah

1445
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,280
because see the reason why i bring it up

1446
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,400
is the following i i also i i'm a bit of

1447
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,000
the opinion that

1448
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,920
i or agree with some of the comments

1449
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,760
that we should try to model it as much

1450
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,760
as possible as a point-to-point thing

1451
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,079
because there is an other

1452
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,400
potential characteristic that we say

1453
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,720
here we say that for point-to-point

1454
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,520
there is a single ce and a single sender

1455
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,200
and a single receiving but i also

1456
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,839
believe when i glance over the draft

1457
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,640
there is a mention of multi-homing

1458
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,440
in

1459
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,880
in the sense that

1460
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,040
even the receiver can consist of

1461
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,440
multiple ces even for a point to point

1462
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,760
and you will have to define

1463
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,160
the proportion of bandwidth that goes to

1464
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,559
one versus the other

1465
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:23,040
not

1466
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,200
to make it even welcome

1467
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,799
yeah yes

1468
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,720
i have to i find myself having to thank

1469
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,440
you for making it more complex um

1470
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,480
sorry about that but yeah yeah

1471
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,680
because

1472
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,920
yeah multi-homing need to think about

1473
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,799
multi-homing in this context

1474
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:42,640
because i think we defined it in i there

1475
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,040
was a sentence of all active and and

1476
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,720
single active and stuff like that so

1477
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,720
even for point-to-point you're not

1478
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,440
restricted restrictive in that sense to

1479
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,920
a single ce device so

1480
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,119
as a result i believe is it not better

1481
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:58,960
that we try to model each of these

1482
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,280
scenarios or traffic

1483
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,400
traffic or connectivity matrixes as a

1484
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,799
as a collection of point to point with

1485
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:09,200
certain characteristics such that

1486
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,400
that uh

1487
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,400
and and use that to define the as a

1488
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,400
layer as a law

1489
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,359
i that's what goes on in my mind is to

1490
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,119
try to help a little bit this thing but

1491
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:20,079
yeah

1492
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:21,920
i wanted to bring up this multi-home to

1493
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,920
as well because that brings yet another

1494
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,680
dimension which makes it even more

1495
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,440
complex

1496
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,599
yes yeah okay need to think about that

1497
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:30,880
definitely

1498
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,960
we have one more minute before uh this

1499
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,400
we take a break maybe you can take one

1500
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,240
more comment and then we can take a

1501
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,040
break

1502
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:42,000
i can do that uh that would be louie

1503
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,280
yeah just about

1504
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,839
yeah uh my comment is really taking a

1505
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,160
step back you know i know what a ce is

1506
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,240
but i'm trying to bring the ce which is

1507
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,680
you know in your draft customer

1508
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,400
endpoints in the context of this i mean

1509
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,040
is it you esee is the app behind the you

1510
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,799
is a ce i'm trying to figure out where

1511
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:02,720
do you define the ce or is it just on

1512
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,240
the network edge

1513
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,319
is that nice

1514
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:09,040
nice nice question because uh we have a

1515
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,680
point coming up on uh on the next slide

1516
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,599
which you'll get after your break

1517
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:14,400
that

1518
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,480
is talking about how we

1519
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,359
talk about endpoint service endpoints in

1520
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:22,480
the context of slicing and i i'm not

1521
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,359
comfortable with ce although we sort of

1522
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,040
understand what it means

1523
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,920
uh it's not very good when the sea is in

1524
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,359
fact a service

1525
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,960
delivery point in the middle of the

1526
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,640
network or

1527
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,799
the end of the the network slice is

1528
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,440
actually in a pe so it's it's it's ugly

1529
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,680
and

1530
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,040
