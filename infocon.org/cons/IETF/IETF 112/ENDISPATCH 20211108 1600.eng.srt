and otherwise we'll just kind of get

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,080
started here today

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,880
um so before we start we always take a

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,960
look at notewell

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,760
so this is a reminder of itf policies in

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,760
effect on various topics so you will

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,720
have agreed to this when you've

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
registered but take a moment now just to

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,159
read it through

28
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,320
and you've got the patent policy and a

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,200
few bcps there to read as well

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,560
so just be aware that when you

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,400
participate and the definition of

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,680
participation is defined in bcp 79

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,880
you're agreeing to follow all these

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,960
processes and policies and if you're

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,880
aware of various contributions being

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,560
covered by patents then you must

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,320
disclose that fact will not participate

38
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,000
in the discussion all of that stuff is

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,640
in the bcps below

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,079
and you know that this meeting is being

41
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,159
recorded and that this recording may be

42
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,600
made public

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,479
um

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,399
personal information you give to the itf

45
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,399
is handled with the privacy statement

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,079
and finally you agree to work

47
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,159
respectfully with other participants and

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,159
you should contact the ombuds team if

49
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,439
you have any questions or concerns about

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,280
that so there's a nice list of bcps

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,600
and we are for this itf just making a

52
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,160
note really well and to really hammer

53
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,080
this point home don't let the no world

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,360
become a boiler plate that you don't

55
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,239
really listen to do take note of it um

56
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,319
itf meetings virtual meetings and

57
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,920
mailing lists are intended for

58
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,120
professional collaboration and

59
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,080
networking no pun intended and there's a

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,160
few lists and conducts and policies

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,560
there on anti-harassment procedures and

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,640
guidelines for conduct but as we say if

63
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,560
you have any concerns about behavior you

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,879
see get in touch with the ombuds team

65
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,720
and so that we can have an environment

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,080
where people are able to do their best

67
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,840
technical work and we're all treated

68
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,480
with dignity decency and respect

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,879
so we'll keep all of that in mind today

70
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,959
um and throughout the week in ietf but

71
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,120
do reach out to the ombuds team if you

72
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,120
notice you and someone else being

73
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,800
harassed or you are being harassed as

79
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,680
sixth virtual itf but it never hurts to

80
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,360
have a refresh please make sure that

81
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,440
your video is off unless you are sharing

82
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,519
or presenting during a session got me

83
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,040
and pete here just so you can see who we

84
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,519
are as we carry on through the session

85
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,599
and but mute your microphone unless you

86
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,080
are speaking we encourage you to use a

87
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,159
headset and for those of you that

88
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,760
remember um blue sheets from the

89
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,440
in-person meetings you needn't worry

90
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,360
about those they're being generated by

91
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,840
the itf data tracker logins

92
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,680
you have chat rooms so on your screen

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,599
you should have um jabber just on the

94
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,840
left chat scrolling through there and if

95
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,440
you need any more information or

96
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,159
assistance on the meat echo um set up

97
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,799
then there's lots of guidance online

98
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,280
on the itf pages

99
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,680
here are a few links just to show you

100
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,159
and that's why jab it you can find jabba

101
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,760
you can find the meat echo although if

102
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,599
you're here then you've already got that

103
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,599
i suppose um and there are the meeting

104
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,840
notes there if you want to head over and

105
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,159
help taking minutes you've had all the

106
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,000
slides and materials for the session at

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,920
the link that's on the page there

108
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,519
and um just to note while we're here

109
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,360
that we did update the charter after the

110
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,680
discussion at the end of the last itf

111
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,920
meeting and that draft charter is still

112
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,519
available on data tracker so if you have

113
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,360
any comments or questions about it then

114
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,680
please do get in touch so far we've had

115
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,918
new feedback really which is maybe a

116
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,199
good sign that everyone's quite happy

117
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,840
with it so

118
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,240
so as we start a reminder on the gen

119
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,759
dispatch process now we know it's

120
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,919
natural for engineers to get um excited

121
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,759
about the work that's being brought here

122
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,680
but just remember that our ground rules

123
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,080
we do not adopt drafts we just recommend

124
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,560
next steps for new work so this is not

125
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,919
about finding the ins and outs of the

126
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,400
draft and working on the draft here we

127
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,720
are finding the way and the place that

128
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
the work should be done

129
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,240
however few possible outcomes that are

130
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,800
listed here this list is not exhaustive

131
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,360
so um the main ones are to direct the

132
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,520
work to an existing working group

133
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,600
maybe to propose a new more focused

134
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,880
working group

135
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,440
to get some ad sponsorship if we have a

136
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,960
willing ad

137
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,039
um to go away and discuss it a bit more

138
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,560
and develop it more in the community

139
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,320
before dispatching it to one of these

140
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,639
places or finally that the itf should

141
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,039
not work on this topic so please keep in

142
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,720
mind throughout today

143
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,479
as you participate when you're at the

144
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,320
mic please state your name before you

145
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,479
speak that can be easy to forget in a

146
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,080
virtual environment so do state your

147
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,400
name before you make your comment

148
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,240
always keep the dispatch question in

149
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,479
mind what do you think should happen to

150
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,160
the work where should it go to be worked

151
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160
on or should it be worked on at all and

152
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,600
try to keep your comment two to three

153
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,440
minutes to allow plentiful discussion

154
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,160
and lots of people to give their input

155
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,560
so to speak you need to join the queue

156
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,160
and that's in the top left of the screen

157
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,320
just underneath your name you'll have a

158
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,479
hand icon with a line through it if you

159
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,759
click that that will put you in the

160
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,000
queue and then chairs or presenters will

161
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,080
manage the queue and bring you forward

162
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,199
and you can then send audio and or video

163
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,360
if you'd like by um clicking the

164
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,199
microphone and the camera buttons just

165
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,280
next to that hand as well

166
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,199
so hopefully you've found where those

167
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,639
buttons are

168
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,560
but give us a shout in java if you get

169
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,800
stuck

170
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,039
and finally some agenda bashing time so

171
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,039
this is our schedule for today

172
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,520
we've got the intro and the admin from

173
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,400
from me first and then we are looking at

174
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,880
all of these items today got a lot of

175
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,800
discussion but also 10 minutes of flex

176
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,319
time so we can

177
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,919
flex slightly or we can finish 10

178
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,759
minutes early it's up to us

179
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,120
and all of these have been on the

180
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,680
mailing lists and all of these have um

181
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,360
slides uploaded as well on the data

182
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,520
tracker all the materials available

183
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,639
on the session so take a look um

184
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,800
and yeah all the links are in the

185
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,639
minutes as well it's on hedge dock if

186
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,560
you are on the agenda as well so you can

187
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,800
click the links from there

188
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,600
so i think that's all the intro and

189
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,360
but i'll just pause for an agenda bash

190
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,199
here maybe pete has an agenda bashed an

191
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:51,919
egg

192
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,319
no i was just wondering please speak up

193
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,599
if you think you're going to need

194
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,720
anything

195
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,199
more significant than a piece of the 10

196
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,919
minutes of flex time

197
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,039
very good

198
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,000
good to me okay so

199
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,880
i think we can get this um started so

200
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,479
i'm happy to drive slides where the

201
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,440

219
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,680
very very short update

220
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,160
uh but just bear with me for

221
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,199
10 seconds so

222
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,599
oops i hit the wrong button all right so

223
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,520
what is what is brian's update this is

224
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,960
one of three documents

225
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,120
that

226
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,240
cover a responsibility change that is

227
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,639
part of the rfc editor future

228
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,960
development program process now as the

229
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,639
community has seen

230
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,680
we've spent a lot of time uh

231
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,879
trying to get that a a new process out

232
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,479
uh that process is coming to conclusion

233
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,360
uh we had our working group last call or

234
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,200
the equivalent thereof for an iav

235
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,159
program uh this past uh these past two

236
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,240
weeks we received a lot of comments but

237
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
i think the document is in generally

238
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,920
pretty good pretty good shape we're

239
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,440
going to resolve some or most of the

240
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,160
comments uh in the in the

241
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,600
the latter part of this week on

242
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,640
wednesday

243
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,240
uh just to go through you know we have

244
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,080
like 20 issues but most of them are

245
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,680
editorial

246
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,320
um but a bunch of places what's going to

247
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,920
happen is we're going to form this new

248
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,320
working group called called the rswg

249
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,519
which is a community community-based

250
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,440
process

251
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,120
and an appeals

252
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,360
chain will go along with that and not

253
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,959
just an appeals chain but an approval

254
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,000
chain

255
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,640
which includes a group called the uh rfc

256
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,920
series

257
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,240
approvals body so what will happen is

258
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,440
the rswg will create policy proposals

259
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,399
and the rsab will approve those

260
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,680
proposals

261
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,040
but this shifts the responsibility

262
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,360
of the rfc editor series from

263
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,640
the

264
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,800
iab to this new organization

265
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,959
at least that's what's proposed

266
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,399
and so that

267
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,680
based on our our processes in the ietf

268
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,720
and elsewhere you know the rfc 2026 says

269
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,600
the iab has this responsibility and

270
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,880
there are a couple of other documents

271
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,720
like 2028 and 20 and 2850 they all say

272
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,360
the same thing some of them are bcps

273
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,440
some of them are informational

274
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,720
some of them

275
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
looks like the ietf should approve some

276
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,959
the iab should approve so a little

277
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,800
coordination is

278
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,600
uh

279
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,920
warranted and so for these documents

280
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,079
including brian's

281
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,160
as well at both brian's actually brian

282
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,560
carpenter sent a note to the email along

283
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,640
the same lines for 20 for for the for

284
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,720
the iab document and then there's

285
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,560
another one i think for 2028 which we're

286
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,000
going to talk about next

287
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,880
um

288
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,040
for this document at least i think that

289
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,519
and for the 2850 document at the very

290
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,399
least

291
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,160
my suggestion is just we just dispatched

292
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,160
this to be uh an ad sponsored draft if

293
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,880
if

294
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,200
um lars is okay with that

295
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,079
um and that the documents should be

296
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,640
approved uh simultaneously with the

297
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,160
model if the model doesn't get approved

298
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,000
these don't need to get approved at this

299
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,279
point it looks like the model will get

300
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,800
approved but the community gets to have

301
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,360
their say on this uh uh point uh first

302
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,760
so so that's at least the proposed plan

303
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,200
and that's all i would want to comment

304
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,279
today

305
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,120
questions comments

306
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,320
how do you want to take those do you

307
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,079
want to wait till the end is now good

308
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,040
time or what people can just join the

309
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,719
queue as they see fit um

310
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,600
but the proposal on the table is

311
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,200
sponsored

312
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,279
and if anybody likes it you know

313
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,440
sorry pete just to just to add

314
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,320
the this document like is one page and

315
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,560
brian carpenter's document is also like

316
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,360
one page so literally they're just

317
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
moving one responsibility it's not a big

318
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
update to 2026 that that will have to

319
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,839
wait till later

320
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,760
so no one's joining the queue does

321
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,320
anybody at least want to uh

322
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,200
plus one the idea of 80 sponsored in the

323
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,720
chat room so we know at least a few

324
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,120

rich you indicated not thrilled with do

336
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,839
you want to uh pipe up about why that is

337
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,560
yeah so i hit return before hitting

338
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,079
finishing the sentence you know this

339
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,839
affects the whole ietf but it's a

340
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,160
trivial thing that another iatf wide

341
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,800
group is already stated so it's

342
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,639
i'm not really concerned in this

343
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,600
particular case okay

344
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,399

357
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,670
to rich

358
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,760
[Laughter]

359
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,519
i'm happy to just click through the

360
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,320
slides which just just say well

361
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,360
okay yeah i'll please do that

362
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,639
uh and start clicking now

363
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,720
uh okay so um during the rfc editor

364
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,200
program a bunch of disc and it's showing

365
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,639
up in other places too but a bunch of

366
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,560
people were saying oh you know 2028 is

367
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,399
really really out of date

368
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,360
um

369
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
not surprising its rfc number is you

370
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
know under 7000

371
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,519
um so here's some i figured oh it can't

372
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,279
be too hard to update

373
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,000
so here's some changes uh

374
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,279
added

375
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,279
for those who don't haven't read it the

376
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,480
rfc

377
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,240
describes the individuals and the

378
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,600
organizations

379
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,040
um that are responsible that are

380
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
involved in the standard ietf standards

381
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,160
process

382
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,480
so for individuals i added a responsible

383
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,040
ad and i reordered it so it follows a

384
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,959
typical workflow

385
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:11,760
you know

386
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,160
authors or authors or editors working

387
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,040
group responsible ad iesg

388
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,519
organizations added the llc and the ietf

389
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,480
trust

390
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,160
reorganized it

391
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,720
reordered that a little bit

392
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,880
overall there were some wordsmithing

393
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,720
used common style and sentence

394
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
structures so like every paragraph of an

395
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,480
organization ends with for more

396
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,120
information go see someone's object

397
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,680
um wordsmithing you know

398
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,920
the document said throughout editor or

399
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,320
editors things like that just in the

400
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,839
beginning we just say we use singular

401
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,040
form

402
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,360
um got great feedback from the

403
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,560
individuals mentioned here

404
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,639
next page

405
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,000

to do's i need to add an acknowledgement

407
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,160
section which became obvious to me when

408
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,000
i wrote the last bullet on the previous

409
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,120
slide

410
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,760

411
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,279
know

412
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,399

413
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,399
editors futures um

414
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,120
like you know a sentence saying the rfc

415
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,560
editors

416

works under policies defined by rs

417
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,839
whatever it is r c w a b something like

418

like to see happen with this draft

428
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,680

429
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,239
you'd like it to go

430
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,160
did you have any thoughts

431
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,680

anyone got any views kind of please join

434
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,839
the queue or pop in jabba what you think

435
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:24,959
should happen

436
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:25,759
um

437
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,959
you can see someone said this could be

438
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,759
another ad sponsor target

439
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,040
seems reasonable would anyone like to

440
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,240
join the queue and express the

441
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,279
sentiments or put something in jabber

442
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,040
to indicate i know it may be very late

443
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,480
or very early for some people in the

444
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,320
room but

445
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,880
hey rich you're in the queue

446
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,079
yeah so

447
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,360
again

448
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,959
there's nothing really um policy in this

449
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,639
document it just points out for someone

450
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,720
who wants an overview of understanding

451
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,440
who's involved in

452
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,360
influencing their

453
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,800
precious

454
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,199
standard stock so i'm fine with ad

455
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,839
sponsored

456
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,000
super okay and we've just got um colin

457
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,640
perkins next in the queue

458
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,520
yeah i just say i i read this and gave

459
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,760
feedback and i thought it's a perfectly

460
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,280
reasonable document

461
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,119
we should go ahead with it and i'm happy

462
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,719
for it to be ad sponsored

463
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,839
okay excellent so that

464
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,320
begs the question do we have an ad

465
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,720
um willing and i see lars has just

466
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,280
joined the queue

467
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,600
yeah hi um the ad who's taking all of

468
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,039
this i guess so this this i think makes

469
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,039
sense for the general 82 sponsor so if

470
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,200
that's the uh outcome of the dispatch

471
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,799
i'll be happy to sponsor

472
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,799
thank you lars so i'm seeing a lot of

473
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,080
plus ones in jabba um i'm not seeing any

474
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,360
disagreement

475
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,000
if you do disagree with the outcome ad

476
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,240
sponsored with lars as their responsible

477
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,200
id

478
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,360
then please speak now or else that's how

479
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,639
we shall dispatch this

480
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,480
okay

481
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,120
not seeing any disagreements so

482
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,880
fabulous thank you rich for your

483
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,799
presentation and that will be the

484
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,160
outcome we'll summarize all of this at

485
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,360
the end of course

486
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,679
but um with that we can move straight on

487
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,520
to our next item which is modifications

488
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,520
to the nom-com process and it's very

489
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,760
i think talking to these slides as it's

490
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,520
only two slides i'll just i'm happy to

491
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,160
drive as well

492
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,080
okay hi uh yes please drive the slides

493
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,480
next slide

494
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,760
and this is the only slide so

495
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,440
this got started when

496
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,120
rich proposed that we discuss a draft

497
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,039
that specified a gap year

498
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,400
basically

499
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,039
that the nom-com can appoint someone to

500
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,000
various positions for up to two terms

501
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,160
and after two terms that person has to

502
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,559
take a year off before getting appointed

503
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,919
to another nom-com appointed term

504
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,240
the idea here was that somebody

505
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
who had served for two terms should go

506
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,000
back to the community

507
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,120
and

508
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,960
do more work in the community before

509
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,960
coming back into the leadership bodies

510
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,919
some of us including me felt that that

511
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,240
hard limits like that were reducing

512
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,880
flexibility on the nom-com too much and

513
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,280
so after some discussion i proposed an

514
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,720
alternative

515
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,400
approach which says

516
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,039
that two terms should be considered

517
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:39,919
uh

518
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,960
the normal maximum but they can the

519
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,200
nomcom can do the right thing and a

520
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,360
point for longer terms if possible and

521
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,480
also allowing a specific uh exception

522
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,120
for the ietf chair role where we expect

523
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,320
people to

524
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,600
move into the iaf ietf chair role

525
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,240
directly from other bodies uh

526
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,360
frequently as has frequently happened

527
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,400
uh john clinton also raised an issue of

528
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,480
a document that he had come up with

529
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,880
before and proposed along with other

530
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,240
people

531
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,039
that

532
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,200
again two two terms is the norm but also

533
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,559
specifying

534
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,880
a different way of handling

535
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,039
incumbents where you process incumbents

536
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,039
where the nomcom processes incumbents

537
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,120
first decides whether to reappoint the

538
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,039
incumbents before soliciting other

539
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,240
people to

540
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,320
put their names in for that role so we

541
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,640
have these three drafts that are

542
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,880
different and the slide says can't be

543
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,760
reconciled but really in discussion of

544
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,360
this it seems like

545
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,960
there are more similarities and

546
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,120
differences basically all three of them

547
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,200
are saying that the norm should be that

548
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,960
you serve two terms in various in one or

549
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,000
various positions and then go back to

550
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
the community for a while before coming

551
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,159
back into the iab the iesg at the moment

552
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,559
the drafts are not talking about the llc

553
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,039
or the ietf trust and we we will we can

554
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,120
get into that later after we dispatch

555
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,400
these

556
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,919
but the issue here that we want to

557
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,640
discuss is what to do with this

558
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,880
um do we want to hash out a little bit

559
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,799
of it right now to get the right

560
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,320
direction

561
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,120
but mostly are we in the right direction

562
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,440
that the community wants to have us work

563
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,640
on and how should we work on it

564
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,120
my personal thought is that this really

565
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,200
does need a working group but i'd like

566
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,760
to hear what everybody else thinks so uh

567
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,360
i'll go ahead and run the queue elliott

568
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,159
that's better thanks barry

569
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,919
get out good afternoon

570
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:42,880
again

571
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,600
um i uh i understand the desire for this

572
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,640
i have some concerns about

573
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,520
what

574
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,840
the unintended consequences that this

575
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,280
could lead to

576
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,799
um

577
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,360
in particular it doesn't seem to me and

578
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,679
you've been on numerous nom-coms

579
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,960
um that we have an overabundance of

580
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,200
applicants at this point

581
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,120
and uh

582
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,039
except for the iab

583
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,880
where we do seem to have a good

584
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,440
candidate supply and so

585
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,880
uh

586
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,039
one of the things uh i would i would be

587
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,960
concerned about this

588
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,960
uh if it were to uh adversely impact

589
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,760
uh really the uh getting good candidates

590
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,760
uh when nobody else is applying and i'm

591
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,919
specifically thinking about

592
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,240
well really the ops area and and

593
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,159
abstinence where we've had where we've

594
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,080
struggled the transport area where we've

595
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,320
struggled in the past and i hate to say

596
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,720
it but you know it takes a special kind

597
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,200
of person to be a security ad

598
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,919
and um and they're rare so

599
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,960
i i i would suggest being very careful

600
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,520
about uh tweaking the rules here

601
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,080
and your thoughts on the dispatch itself

602
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,440
elliot

603
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,000
a buff

604
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,640
rather than going straight to work

605
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,600
okay but indeed on your concern

606
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,480
that's exactly why i made my proposal

607
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,000
which uh

608
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
does not specify hard limits tells the

609
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,520
nom-com that

610
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,760
this is the expectation of normal

611
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,000
situations but the nom-com needs to do

612
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,640
what the nom-com feels it needs to do

613
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,440
and should explain to needs to explain

614
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,520
to the um

615
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,520
the confirming body and should explain

616
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,280
to the community why

617
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,320
they have

618
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,120
taken a different path if they do

619
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,280
but yes the nomcom absolutely needs the

620
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,200
flexibility because we do have a problem

621
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,080
with

622
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,400
having the right volunteers

623
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,640
i'll let me just finish up by saying i

624
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,480
guess i'm okay with that sort of a

625
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,679
direction

626
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:48,559
right

627
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,720
but if the language has to be couched

628
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,240
very gently

629
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,720
barry because i'm just very i i think we

630
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,720
could put off a non we could force a nom

631
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,279
com to make a bad decision as easily as

632
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,720
we could force them to make a good one

633
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,320
um thanks elliot uh colin you're up next

634
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,000
and i am watching the jabra chat and

635
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,520
we'll try and get some of that into the

636
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,158
notes as well

637
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,159
so i on the dispatch question i think we

638
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,159
should scope this to i to resolving what

639
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,640
we do about iesg to start with okay i

640
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,559
like like ib doesn't matter it's the

641
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,200
retirement forum as an ieb member i mean

642
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,080
many of the other ones are more

643
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,240
complicated i think we should really

644
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,400
focus on isg is where the heart problem

645
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,840
is here and do that one first and

646
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,360
independently from the rest to figure

647
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,559
out what we want

648
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,600
on there

649
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,240
i think above is a reasonable suggestion

650
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,400
and perhaps one that tried to actually

651
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,159
come to a resolution of the problem not

652
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,840
a buff to form a working group but maybe

653
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,360
off to sort of you know see if we can

654
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,320
come to

655
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,279
some group consensus on this now i

656
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,080
actually i think that our current system

657
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,799
is

658
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,279
highly in favors the encumbrance and i

659
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,360
think all the people speaking to

660
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,120
nom-com doesn't have enough choices part

661
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,320
of the reason nom-com doesn't have

662
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,080
enough choices is because we keep doing

663
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,039
things

664
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,120
that favor the people that are currently

665
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,200
there it makes it really hard to set an

666
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,679
expectation of growing new talent and we

667
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,440
need to set an expectation of growing

668
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,840
new talent we've been trying this advice

669
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,279
this advice that we have right now we've

670
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,480
been trying it for years it isn't

671
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,720
working so i actually think that we very

672
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,200
much should go to uh to term limit or

673
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,440
something like that uh it sounds very

674
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,480
reasonable for isg um and i actually

675
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,559
think that will improve the choices

676
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,880
nom-com has i think giving sort of the

677
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,640
vague fluffy advice we've been giving to

678
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,960
namcom for years is just not even worth

679
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,039
bothering spending the time discussing

680
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,960
so if that's the outcome people want i

681
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,720
don't think it's worth discussing we've

682
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,320
been there too many times before thanks

683
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,480
thanks colin

684
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,360
uh robert you're up

685
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,240
so

686
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,039
i got in the queue to say

687
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,039
what i think is almost the opposite of

688
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,679
what colin just said so i'm digesting

689
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,080
some of of of cohen's comments to

690
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,440
pull out that perhaps if there is work

691
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,159
to dispatch here it is not work to build

692
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,240
a

693
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,600
document that is a set of guidance to

694
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,919
nom com it is work that is the community

695
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,159
trying to discuss

696
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,600
mechanics

697
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,440
for changing the way the potential

698
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,640
leadership pool is built

699
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,840
i personally don't see value in trying

700
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,720
to create a new set of rules for nom-com

701
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,240
to follow in seating incumbents

702
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,400
i think that the right thing to do is

703
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,320
exactly the thing that cullen says isn't

704
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,520
working

705
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,400
um

706
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,960
is to provide this feedback as

707
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,080
individuals to each nom-com

708
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,240
so that each nom-com sees how much of

709
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,240
the community cares

710
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,880
about whether or not we have

711
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,080
the repeat assignments um to these

712
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,919
positions

713
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,080
um and i i really

714
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,159
don't think that any

715
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,880
static set of texts that could be

716
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,840
applied across nom-coms could be written

717
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,760
flexibly enough

718
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,640
to not over constrain them and still

719
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,720
give them useful input that they

720
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,399
wouldn't otherwise get through the

721
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,720
direct feedback so

722
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,279
i will um close again returning to um my

723
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,360
attempt to pull out of

724
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,120
um

725
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,320
what i was hearing cohen say in is that

726
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,279
there may be work here to do but it

727
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,120
isn't writing

728
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,919
text for a nom-com it is actually

729
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,640
thinking about engineering the

730
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,880
re-engineering the way we build the

731
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,159
inputs

732
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,080
um to what an omcom looks at

733
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,918
mechanism for doing that you think

734
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,480
or that that's the

735
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
yeah

736
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,440
i would have to be above i can't i can't

737
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,360
see of anything else so we would cast

738
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,200
wide enough that would would actually

739
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,960
generate

740
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,200
um

741
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,520
substantial

742
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,320
substantive suggestions

743
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,840
i i'd like to respond to

744
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,360
i'd like to respond to

745
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,600
robert on one point that i

746
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,760
i think that if

747
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,000
i think there's value in having a

748
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
community consensus

749
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,360
on that guidance as opposed to

750
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,440
a bunch of individual

751
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,279
opinions on the guidance that go to

752
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,039
nom-com each time

753
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,600
it avoids the issue having the consensus

754
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,080
avoids the issue that the nom-com has to

755
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,600
decide whether there are a bunch of

756
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,360
vocal people who are telling them what

757
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,600
they what they should be doing

758
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,080
as opposed to some consensus that had

759
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,760
been established by the community

760
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,360
now i guess my my reaction to that is is

761
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,720
that the nomcom are going to get those

762
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,960
vocal opinions anyhow

763
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,200
um and if you're saying that they're

764
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,799
that they need a

765
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,360
thing to fall back to in order to

766
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,360
protect themselves from thinking too

767
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,840
much about the

768
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,399
the

769
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,559
the people that are coming vocally to

770
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,000
the mic um

771
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,919
everybody's pointing to the the the

772
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,159
dangers of having the the hard cases

773
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,799
there sometimes the

774
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:37,840
um

775
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,399
vocal people coming in aren't the the

776
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,559
the same set and there may be a reason

777
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,240
to come up and be vocal about any

778
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,760
written restrictions that they've had

779
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,360
before

780
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,320
so it's

781
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,399
we've been thrashing on the list

782
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,559
and your slide points to the the

783
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,880
um the content of the thresh and and i

784
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,760
guess my position on this is that there

785
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,480
that the

786
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,440
it's a natural consequence of the

787
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,039
problem of

788
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,960
the guidance suggestion that we're

789
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,399
trying to give

790
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,399
and that i think that if we went through

791
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,600
the effort to build um a new

792
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,919
set of guidance to nom-coms in text form

793
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:22,880
we would

794
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,720
immediately start rehashing it

795
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,200
thanks robert

796
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,919
lucy you're up next

797
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,559
and you're still showing my

798
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,440
my camera there you are

799
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,159
yeah my camera is off

800
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,760
so

801
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,000
my issue is slightly orthogonal here

802
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,919
i i think

803
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,519
that we need to be reopening the nom-com

804
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,360
document

805
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,159
there

806
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,240
since suresh there have been a long set

807
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,480
of

808
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,640
changes that need to happen just for

809
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,880
race conditions that exist in the

810
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,159
current overlaps of things like

811
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,679
iab to isg transfers

812
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,679
uh what happened when alyssa was made

813
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,440
chair and left an art

814
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,960
seat open

815
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,320
there are a lot of things that need to

816
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
get addressed anywhere

817
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,640
and i might

818
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,120
suggest that barry's suggestion of a

819
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,919
working group to reopen that document

820
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,159
might also encompass this discussion

821
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,679
okay so you would see this as a

822
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,120
potential

823
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,360
grand non-common working group with this

824
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,279
is one item and

825
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,799
um technical fixes to process

826
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,640
as the other that's been

827
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,679
promised since before the

828
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,000
the most recent set of isa changes

829
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,039
and

830
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,240
it's probably overdue

831
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,159
okay

832
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,360
we've got that in the notes

833
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,039
uh

834
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,000
john you're up to that

835
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,159
yeah i uh

836
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,960
taking this in reverse order i uh tend

837
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,360
to agree with lucille a bit

838
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,399
uh i'd rather see a buff here or

839
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,960
and and and to have that book but but my

840
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,720
preferred outcome of that buff would be

841
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,000
to uh

842
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
uh formal working group to look at this

843
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,519
this is because thanks to more broad

844
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,480
issues

845
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,799
uh

846
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,720
doing nothing

847
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,399
but we're clearly not going to solve the

848
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,279
problem today because this is

849
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,919
uh is is more complicated

850
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,120
and uh

851
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,360
and for example colin made the comment

852
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,720
that uh

853
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,960
uh that transfers from the isg to the

854
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,000
iab immediately are okay and i think i

855
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,760
have seen that work out sufficiently

856
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,840
badly that i'd like the downcom to

857
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,320
be warned by consensus as barry points

858
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,799
out rather than a few loud voices in

859
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,240
both directions

860
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,919
that that often hasn't worked out should

861
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,760
be looked at carefully

862
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,200
um

863
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,600
[Music]

864
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,559
i'm

865
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,559
there are people who i am perfectly

866
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,960
happy having third terms

867
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,440
but they are people who i have

868
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,320
exceptional trust in their ability to

869
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,480
figure out when they need to stop

870
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,600
and

871
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,679
it is quite commonly into the case that

872
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,039
people have not been able to figure out

873
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,360
how to stop where to stop unlike the

874
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,679
original version of barry's proposal

875
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,640
i don't in spite of having been one i

876
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,640
don't believe that moving

877
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,919
people from the isg to the iap without a

878
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,919
break is a particularly good idea there

879
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,919
may be exceptions

880
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,720
and uh and i don't think moving people

881
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,360
around within the isg without a break is

882
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,960
a particularly good idea although there

883
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,480
may be exceptions

884
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,080
and as far as the argument that we don't

885
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,399
have enough candidates is concerned

886
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,359
um

887
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,599
i my crystal ball is certainly no better

888
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,000
than anybody else's or maybe worse

889
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,359
but uh

890
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,320
but my sense is that

891
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,159
that if we start keeping people in

892
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,480
positions because we feel like we don't

893
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,960
have any better choices we better have a

894
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,320
different we'd better address a

895
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,879
different set of problems

896
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,320
because

897
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,839
it leads to

898
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,760
saying well he's terrible but we don't

899
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,839
have anybody else and

900
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,719
foolishness or time and perhaps he will

901
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,480
become more terrible

902
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,918
uh so

903
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,159
this this is a complex and nuanced

904
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,199
problem

905
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,079
and i think we at least need the the

906
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,560
benefits of extended discussion and if

907
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,079
we're willing to open the can of worms

908
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,239
and won't boil those in the process i

909
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,239
agree with lucy looking at the whole

910
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,480
process of knowing what went into it

911
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,800
especially because number of assumptions

912
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,359
that have seriously changed since

913
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,119
we set that process in motion

914
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,359
an internet century ago

915
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,800
uh would be a good idea

916
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,000
um

917
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,240
let me ask a question and lucy you can

918
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,160
pipe back up if you want

919
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,880
um there's been some suggestion a few

920
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,960
suggestions that maybe a buff to discuss

921
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,960
um the area proposed by these three

922
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,320
proposals

923
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,359
um would be a good idea

924
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:32,560
would you be

925
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,800
inclined to include the grander

926
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,599
discussion in such a buff have that buff

927
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,680
and then charter working group that

928
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,440
might also

929
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,280
do the other technical stuff

930
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,960
looking for what our recommendation for

931
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,079
outcomes going to be here

932
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,320
so

933
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,119
a bot that that took in

934
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,160
the inputs from the past compares on the

935
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,440
stuff that's

936
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,240
actually currently broken

937
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,040
in addition to this which is

938
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
uh soft guidance

939
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,280
from the community that isn't actually

940
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,720
in the document

941
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,839
i mean there are things that are

942
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,599
actually broken

943
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,520
that need to be fixed

944
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,560
so if

945
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,280
that's why i'm asking

946
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,800
okay so it it it doesn't matter to you

947
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,200
whether we bring that into a buff do it

948
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,119
as separate and then put together a

949
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,280
charter that might include both

950
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,520
um

951
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,200
somewhere that's got to get fixed and

952
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,040
this is where the discussion starts

953
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,240
that's fine

954
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,520
but a

955
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,200
down to just this issue is not enough

956
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,320
got it

957
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,480
got it okay you appreciate it john do

958
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,640
you have any thoughts on that

959
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,079
yeah i

960
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,560
i think if you do it off which includes

961
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,880
the broader issues as well as this one

962
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,480
you're guaranteeing the recommendation

963
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,359
is going to be a working group

964
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,320
the cadillac which discusses this only

965
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,599
and concludes whether there should be a

966
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,800
working group

967
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,880
an ad sponsored document out of some

968
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,040
very rough consensus above

969
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,720
or something else

970
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,560
like throwing it all away

971
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,400
that becomes a different kind of

972
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,440
question

973
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,079
now because because like lucy i favor

974
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,839
opening the big problem

975
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,920
if we can avoid open if we can do it

976
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,320
without getting

977
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,960
so constipated by the overwhelming size

978
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,040
of the job and the size of the ocean we

979
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,119
need to boil we do nothing

980
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,480
then uh

981
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,040
then sure do it do do it that way with a

982
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,359
ball or or go charter a working group

983
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,920
immediately

984
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,079
okay

985
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,000
good input thank you

986
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,280
um sam you're off the bat

987
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,240
hi there uh with all respect to cullen i

988
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,160
i don't want to see us putting in hard

989
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,240
guidance here and i think we should not

990
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,480
be trying to solve this problem

991
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,680
i'm open

992
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,520
to attacking the bigger issues that lucy

993
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,560
raised

994
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,760
um

995
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,680
and so i guess if we're going to do that

996
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,520
we should actually have two buffs as

997
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,520
john points out one to

998
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,280
decide whether to include this and one

999
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,480
to deal with the other things that we

1000
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,240
know need to be there

1001
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,800
um i do want to push back though on one

1002
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,560
little thing i heard which was the

1003
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,880
suggestion that

1004
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,760
if we give this guidance to nomcom they

1005
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,280
need to explain

1006
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,200
why they would diverge from it i do not

1007
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,839
want to see us imposing a requirement

1008
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,839
that namcoms have to explain themselves

1009
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,440
to the community

1010
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,520
because it could implicate

1011
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,119
interesting things about the feedback

1012
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,359
they've gotten

1013
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,960
so i do not i'm pushing back

1014
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,480
particularly against what barry had said

1015
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,240
there i don't want to see mom comes

1016
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,599
being told they have to explain their

1017
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,800
choices to the community

1018
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,640
whereas they they need to explain it to

1019
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,400
the confirming body so the confirming

1020
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,280
body has the information to confirm and

1021
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,640
they are already bound by the same

1022
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,480
privacy the same confidentiality

1023
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,560
requirements as the phone

1024
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,880
i i'm i'm actually skeptical of that

1025
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,359
also barry i'm

1026
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,280
less convinced that they need to explain

1027
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,800
everything to the confirming bodies but

1028
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,400
all right

1029
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,240
point taken thanks

1030
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,200
uh

1031
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,680
phil you're up

1032
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,759
phil colombaker

1033
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,119
there you are

1034
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,440
so yeah um

1035
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,079
i think it's something that we need to

1036
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,440
think about

1037
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,760
uh i don't think that now is the right

1038
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,000
time to be making a change

1039
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,800
though

1040
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,480
because

1041
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,240
it's quite realistically going to be

1042
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,160
four years

1043
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,359
from the last face-to-face

1044
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:58,800
itf

1045
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,720
to the next one

1046
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,960
and i'm serious i don't think that we're

1047
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,119
going to be meeting next year

1048
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,680
i think it's unlikely

1049
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,680
and it's not certain we're going to meet

1050
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,119
the year after that

1051
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,720
so

1052
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,079
in terms of institutional continuity

1053
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,079
if you have a situation where every

1054
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,240
single person on the isg and the iab

1055
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,319
has no experience of running the itf

1056
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,680
in its normal mode

1057
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,480
that's quite a big institutional shock

1058
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,319
you're throwing at it

1059
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,839
and so in these very specific

1060
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,280
circumstances i think you need to think

1061
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,440
very hard about

1062
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,040
whether this is the right time to make

1063
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,280
that change

1064
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,880
that said

1065
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,960
i do think that there needs to be some

1066
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,000
form of term limit in that um

1067
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,319
you know when when i'm looking through

1068
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,480
uh should i

1069
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,520
uh nominate myself

1070
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,520
no

1071
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,839
if there is an incumbent that is

1072
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,560
re-upping i am extremely unlikely to uh

1073
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,440
put myself forward

1074
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,799
um

1075
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,800
you know i

1076
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,400
the first question is going to be am i

1077
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,640
going to do a better job than they are

1078
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,040
and since i have not done that job it's

1079
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,319
extremely unlikely i'm going to say yes

1080
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,200
and i'm not exactly known for being one

1081
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,839
of the less egotistical persons in this

1082
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,800
organization

1083
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,599
so

1084
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,000
anyway

1085
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,960
thanks phil

1086
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,079
uh

1087
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,800
and i'll just repeat out loud just so we

1088
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,839
get people to the mic if they need to

1089
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,920
kirsty said earlier it sounds like we're

1090
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,920
coalescing toward a bath that includes

1091
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,680
at least this issue please get in the

1092
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,520
queue if you disagree

1093
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,839
um and heard some of the disagreement

1094
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,119
already in from sam in the jabber room

1095
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,800
feel free to disagree in the jab room as

1096
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,640
well but if you think you want to get up

1097
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,040
to the mic on that point please do

1098
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,560
um

1099
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,520
so andrew go ahead

1100
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,680
uh except your audio doesn't seem to be

1101
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,680
on

1102
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,760
you surprised me um

1103
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,920
no not that andrew sorry uh we have two

1104
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,280
andrews and i should have been more

1105
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,560
clear andrew alston please go ahead

1106
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,760
um

1107
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,760
oh you've moved yourself back to the

1108
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,440
back of the cube all right uh don

1109
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,240
eastlake is up then and then we'll uh

1110
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,598
uh get andrew campbell

1111
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,480
uh hi there so i just want to

1112
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,079
brief comment uh

1113
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,400
i'm very much opposed to a hard

1114
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,240
term limits uh

1115
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,079
i've been a number of nom-coms and the

1116
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,240
namcom needs to be able to

1117
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,640
do what it needs to do to fill the the

1118
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,599
uh

1119
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,520
necessary leadership positions but i

1120
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,880
certainly understand people who believe

1121
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,640
that uh soft admonitions are unlikely to

1122
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,800
be very effective and i just wanted to

1123
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,560
point out there are intermediate things

1124
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,160
that can be done

1125
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,240
one would just be for example when the

1126
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,240
nom-com is listing

1127
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,119
the

1128
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,680
candidates and so forth uh uh clearly

1129
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,440
labeled incumbents until maybe label how

1130
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,839
many terms they've served how incumbent

1131
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,680
are they uh

1132
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,280
and maybe even have a little note with

1133
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,640
that pointing out that if somebody's

1134
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,040
been encumbered for a while it's uh even

1135
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,800
more likely that uh

1136
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,640
that somebody will replace them and you

1137
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,160
should consider volunteering for that

1138
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,280
the other thing is you could actually

1139
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,200
even tweak the voting requirements

1140
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,720
within the nom-com

1141
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,560
so it requires a slightly higher vote

1142
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,440
for the nom-com to propose somebody for

1143
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,640
the

1144
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,400
whatever you decide fourth or later

1145
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,119
third or later uh

1146
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,520
repeat uh in the same position

1147
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,319
so those are my points

1148
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,319
um

1149
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,240
all right uh andrew kaplan why don't you

1150
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,640
go ahead and i'll get andrew austin at

1151
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,880
the end of the queue

1152
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,160
uh hi yeah so reflecting on some of the

1153
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,040
comments uh particularly in the chat uh

1154
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,599
it seems to me that we sort of

1155
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,640
moved away from term limits

1156
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,119
to quite a lot of comments so more

1157
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,480
focused on the talent pipeline

1158
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,800
um so if there is to be a buff i really

1159
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,440
think it needs to focus on that

1160
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,400
um

1161
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,560
rather than term limits which feels like

1162
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,560
that that's addressing a symptom

1163
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,480
and not not the underlying cause

1164
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,880
so far rather sort of get get at the

1165
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,720
real problem not just

1166
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,319
uh sort of go after they feel like the

1167
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,079
easy bit which is just uh the sort of

1168
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,680
cosmetic term limits thing

1169
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,000
appreciate it thanks andrew

1170
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,640
and andrew alston you're up

1171
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,119
can you guys hear me now

1172
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,560
very good um

1173
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,720
okay so

1174
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,200
looking at this i

1175
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,240
hard limits versus guidance

1176
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,720
i do feel

1177
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,040
that giving guidance to the non-com such

1178
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,560
that

1179
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,040
they have a

1180
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,359
fixed criteria that when the confirming

1181
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,800
bodies if they hit a particular

1182
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,280
exception for example if the guidance is

1183
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,880
two years then

1184
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,200
three is kind of abnormal and four is an

1185
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,960
exception

1186
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,280
i do think that does give them something

1187
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,000
to to explain against and i was the one

1188
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
who said it does give them something

1189
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,280
where they can actually be asked not

1190
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,920
just in general ask them anything but

1191
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,240
for those exceptional criteria and it

1192
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,160
does bring more transparency to the

1193
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,160
process

1194
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,240
which i think is important

1195
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,200
um

1196
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,720
at the same time with the number of

1197
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,119
issues that are being raised i have to

1198
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,599
agree that i think that

1199
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:58,720
either

1200
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,720
a buff which leads to a working group or

1201
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,240
even straight to a working group is

1202
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,160
definitely

1203
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,640
a valid idea because i think that there

1204
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,480
are a lot of issues here

1205
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,520
um

1206
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,359
and

1207
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:12,720
i think that

1208
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,560
we could clarify a number of things so

1209
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,800
yeah i would definitely support either

1210
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,640
going from above to a working group or

1211
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,560
straight into a working group

1212
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,920
um

1213
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,480
whichever is actually fastest and will

1214
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,280
lead to the least blockage

1215
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,599
thanks

1216
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,440
um

1217
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,680
just in part what i'm hearing and and

1218
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,560
this goes to lucy's comment and jones

1219
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,480
follow-up in particular

1220
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,760
is

1221
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,560
it sounds like no one is objecting to

1222
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,560
the things that need to be done in the

1223
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,720
document that are that are broken

1224
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,520
um process points

1225
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,960
and

1226
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,640
um

1227
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,640
perhaps

1228
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,560
the both can

1229
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,880
can simply say

1230
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,400
yes we're on board with getting a

1231
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,560
working group to work on those things or

1232
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,640
maybe an ad sponsored document and then

1233
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,920
go on to the question of

1234
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,760
the um

1235
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,319
this particular topic whether that's

1236
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,800
term limits some softened version of

1237
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,480
that or

1238
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,520
the um the pipeline

1239
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,960
as the bigger buff topic

1240
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,400
um barry did you want to speak to that

1241
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,839
do we really need a buff for the

1242
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,800
mechanical changes that need to be

1243
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,800
made

1244
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,280
i i think the right thing to do for that

1245
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,359
is to go straight to chartering a

1246
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,000
working group for that part

1247
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,960
and maybe have a buff on whether

1248
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,200
we want to add to that working group's

1249
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,720
charter

1250
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,359
this stuff

1251
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,598
jorlus do you want to speak to that also

1252
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,880
bring up you know some some points that

1253
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,359
you know for me being on nomcom this

1254
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,520
year we're kind of kind of lacking right

1255
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,400
so

1256
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,400
one is that i do especially for isg um

1257
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,280
you know

1258
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,119
always like to

1259
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,160
see you know how good somebody is is is

1260
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,119
doing reviews right in terms of okay uh

1261
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:24,480
you know

1262
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,800
that's a big part of the job right so

1263
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,520
the the tooling to figure out uh what

1264
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,280
reviews somebody has done or so are

1265
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,720
lacking right so you need to go to the

1266
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,640
different working groups

1267
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,400
search through all that stuff right so

1268
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,920
if we had reviews from non-isg member or

1269
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,720
you know uh reviews from anybody

1270
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,640
better in tooling you know that review

1271
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,599
of you know past you know contribution

1272
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,359
to that important part of the isg job

1273
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,520
would be much easier to vet for nomcom

1274
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,000
so that that goes to the core of the job

1275
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,319
responsibility and and that would be my

1276
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,079
kind of main point that i think hasn't

1277
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,240
been mentioned

1278
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,359
uh lars go ahead

1279
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,359
yeah hey um

1280
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:12,319
so

1281
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,160
i i've heard sort of all options from

1282
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,839
you know ad sponsored documents loop off

1283
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,000
to straight to working group and and to

1284
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,160
me as sort of the 80 for the area right

1285
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,319
it's it's still a bit unclear what we're

1286
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,559
actually talking about here so if there

1287
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,240
are some things and i think lucy gave

1288
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,520
some examples that are sort of

1289
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,119
quote-unquote no-brainers and we should

1290
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,079
just do them right um i would at least

1291
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:33,440
want to see them written down in some

1292
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,480
form that that we can agree what if this

1293
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,480
is a no-brainer or it requires above or

1294
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,040
not right um if there's other non-comp

1295
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,079
related topics um that would sort of uh

1296
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,599
you know make sense to do like the ones

1297
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,599
that that barry has presented and

1298
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,000
richard and john have written down

1299
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,520
um

1300
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,640
you know people can propose a buff that

1301
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,480
would sort of maybe as one work item

1302
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,000
work on the sort of no-brainer things

1303
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,319
that lucy talked about but also

1304
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,559
you know suggest other work items like

1305
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,240
like this right or something along those

1306
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,319
lines and and then we can have a buff

1307
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,480
and see what happens um i think it's

1308
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,800
pretty unlikely that we're gonna so

1309
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,079
let me rephrase that i think i'm

1310
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,160
uncomfortable with doing homecom

1311
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,680
specific changes unless they're like

1312
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,760
really really simple and really really

1313
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,880
urgent

1314
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,400
as ad sponsored documents i think we

1315
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,559
need to have a broad discussion on them

1316
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,720
um and so above is is

1317
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,880
the best way for that if they're simple

1318
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,599
if after we get above proposal we we say

1319
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,240
this is so clearly you know uh a waste

1320
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,680
of time to hold above let's go straight

1321
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,960
to working group that's certainly an

1322
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,119
option but i think sort of the

1323
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,040
targeting above seems to be the right

1324
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,040
the right thing to do

1325
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,040
so just to understand you don't think

1326
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,240
um

1327
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,760
that going straight to working group

1328
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,079
chartering for the no-brainers

1329
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,240
uh is even particularly good idea we

1330
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:52,960
should

1331
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,640
buff those

1332
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,000
see what we're going to do about that

1333
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,599
and then go on to the more complicated

1334
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:58,720
topics

1335
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,040
so if i see them written up in a way

1336
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,200
that i know what they are right i can

1337
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,359
answer the question at the moment i

1338
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,680
can't answer the question

1339
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,240
it could be possible but i don't simply

1340
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,640
i don't know

1341
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,559
and but and my sense is and kirsty and i

1342
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,240
are talking in the background

1343
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,359
jabbering

1344
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:20,720
um

1345
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,400
it sounds like we have two

1346
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,280
things to do here one is to get written

1347
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,760
up the the no brainers list as you've

1348
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,240
been calling it i i like that

1349
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,400
um see if that can go straight to

1350
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,440
chartering

1351
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,599
uh for a working group or what to be

1352
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,640
done there

1353
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,839
and then

1354
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:40,960
um or

1355
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,200
that it requires more buffing and we do

1356
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,839
that and then separately this set of

1357
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,480
topics um we definitely need to have

1358
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,559
some buffing for to decide

1359
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,079
what if anything we're going to do about

1360
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,000
that

1361
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,839
um

1362
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:57,760
i i think that's where we're going with

1363
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,079
this

1364
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,880
that's right

1365
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,800
let's um we'll we'll circle back at the

1366
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,480
end of the discussion

1367
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,920
i'll try and come up with a clearer

1368
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,160
summary and see if anyone objects to

1369
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,440
that summary

1370
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,359
uh thanks for leaving that barry that

1371
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,160
was helpful

1372
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,640
the time

1373
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,319
all right

1374
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:25,200
i'll take back the pen and give

1375
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,040
thirsty the mic

1376
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,079
yeah thank you so um we've got our last

1377
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,960
topic now which is on antitrust so joel

1378
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,160
um will be presenting so julie you said

1379
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,400
you'd like to drive your own slides so

1380
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,000
the button to do that is just next to

1381
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,280
the join queue

1382
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,119
um there should be like share pre-loaded

1383
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,880
slides and your slides should be up

1384
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,040
there i have

1385
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,040
a share the button to request sharing

1386
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,040
you need to give me permission

1387
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,359
then it will

1388
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:54,720
give me

1389
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,839
then

1390
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:59,520
i have to find my deck in this there

1391
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,319
and say share that

1392
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,960
okay thank you folks

1393
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,960
there are a few more slides in this one

1394
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,520
than in the previous ones because given

1395
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,200
that there was some discussion of this

1396
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,839
before and that we've made major changes

1397
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:15,680
i wanted to actually cover the

1398
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,319
significant content in this as well as

1399
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:19,839
make clear what we're trying to

1400
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,040
accomplish

1401
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,160
so first

1402
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,760
this is a draft

1403
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,160
that if we turn it into an rfc the goal

1404
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,640
is that it be part of the note well

1405
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,079
i've therefore

1406
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:33,760
currently suggested it be a bcp

1407
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,000
if it can be a part of notewell and

1408
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,480
people prefer it i don't

1409
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,079
really object if it's instead

1410
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,640
informational that's really minor the

1411
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,520
point is that it's community consensus

1412
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,559
on guidelines not rules

1413
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,280
guidelines on how to avoid getting into

1414
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,359
antitrust trouble

1415
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:56,000
that is clearly called out to everybody

1416
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,839
so that people actually know about it

1417
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,480
because if people don't know about the

1418
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,359
guidelines they don't do any good

1419
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,359
the goal here is to protect people to

1420
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,359
protect to protect participants who are

1421
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,920
doing things to protect other people who

1422
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,359
are in the room because it turns out you

1423
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:12,880
can get affected by other people's

1424
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,839
actions

1425
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:15,520
and to protect the ietf as an

1426
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,520
organization

1427
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,559
from antitrust issues

1428
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,720
so we want to help make sure people know

1429
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,559
that it helps

1430
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:26,640
making sure people know it helps a whole

1431
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,319
lot in a lot of ways

1432
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,800
and just telling people ah just follow

1433
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,800
the law well

1434
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,800
i at least find that utterly useless

1435
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,400
advice so

1436
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,720
i wanted something more useful as i said

1437
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,680
proposed to the bcp that's just

1438
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,839
whatever it takes

1439
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,480
now even before brian sent his note i

1440
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,160
did realize that one of the

1441
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,319
key questions was do we need this

1442
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:57,839
the answer is i sure think so

1443
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,319
note that all the other standards bodies

1444
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:03,680
have ended up spending a lot of money

1445
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,480
and are still spending a lot of money

1446
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,079
dealing with this and hoping they don't

1447
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,319
end up like in even worse trouble

1448
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,720
we say that people participate here as

1449
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,160
individuals

1450
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,720
but people are also here on behalf of

1451
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,280
their companies it's not an either or no

1452
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,520
there are some people who are really

1453
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,760
just here as individuals

1454
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,760
great wonderful

1455
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,960
but

1456
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,319
for the rest of us it ain't true

1457
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,400
i mean after all we recognize that

1458
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,200
people's association affiliation matters

1459
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,839
in all sorts of detailed ways

1460
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,359
so

1461
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:44,799
the company companies do impact this

1462
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,680
antitrust does affect us it could make a

1463
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,040
big difference

1464
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,200
so telling people things they need to

1465
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,720
know that are

1466
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,520
widely understood and accepted to be

1467
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,920
important things to avoid

1468
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,240
is really important i actually think

1469
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,319
that even the harder cases will be

1470
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:03,839
helpful to us

1471
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,400
mike we'll get back to it but getting

1472
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,920
some discussion of what the community

1473
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,000
considers the right things

1474
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,319
would be really helpful here

1475
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,400
i'm not saying this is what i want i

1476
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,559
want the community's agreement on what

1477
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,640
these guidelines are

1478
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,200
so the goals are as i stated

1479
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,480
referenced by

1480
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,680
notewell

1481
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,520
the shorter term is to get agreement on

1482
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,920
discussing that the immediate goal

1483
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,040
therefore is

1484
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,480
i'm going to tell you what i've done in

1485
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,880
the document and then we can discuss how

1486
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,880
the heck do we dispatch it

1487
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,799
because

1488
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:39,599
i

1489
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:43,119
as you'll see on my last slide

1490
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,119
there's nothing that quite seems to make

1491
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:47,040
sense but we need to do something trying

1492
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,599
to do this without community discussion

1493
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,520
is not suitable

1494
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,440
john do you need want to say something

1495
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,720
now or should i keep going

1496
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,720
you either way

1497
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,880
go ahead

1498
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,119
uh

1499
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,400
i

1500
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,480
maybe i should have said keep going

1501
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,880
um okay

1502
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,799
it's i'm certainly strongly in favor of

1503
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,760
doing this and uh as you know but many

1504
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,839
people listening may not i i've been

1505
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,240
saying that for 20 years because

1506
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,599
i got involved in some of those things

1507
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,119
with other standards bodies and i know

1508
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:27,359
how painful know firsthand how painful

1509
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:28,559
it can get

1510
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:29,680
um

1511
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,680
at the same time

1512
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,760
uh the the description of the can of

1513
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,240
worms which is getting opened here if we

1514
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,400
address this and we've been told

1515
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,920
this repeatedly when this has been

1516
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,799
discussed by with uh with legal counsel

1517
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,520
who especially is in this area

1518
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,640
uh is that the idea of uh of people

1519
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,319
participating as an individual as

1520
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:54,799
individuals could easily be a fatality

1521
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:57,359
i hope that isn't the result but that's

1522
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,680
one of the things we'll have to discuss

1523
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,400
right exactly thank you

1524
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,359
okay

1525
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,119
uh so

1526
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,839
i'll now go through the

1527
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,040
changes because

1528
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,599
we brought this forward

1529
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,440
and there were discussions and we did

1530
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,680
notice the discussions and then the

1531
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,520
co-authors had more discussions and we

1532
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,760
rewrote section five i mean when i wrote

1533
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,760
the diff it basically says

1534
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,200
ah section five is completely different

1535
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,400
so we did

1536
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,280
uh

1537
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,200
and we got some legal input we found

1538
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,680
some older legal input we've we've tried

1539
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,760
to collect the inputs

1540
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,920
the first thing is we renamed because of

1541
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,119
the feedback

1542
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,359
section 5 from recommended behavior to

1543
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:41,280
additional guidelines it's all

1544
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,559
guidelines

1545
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,079
and then we had to reword the start of

1546
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,480
section 5 to match that

1547
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,720
the text still needs work there are all

1548
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,559
sorts of interesting corner cases that

1549
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,559
are not fully handled

1550
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,400
the point of having discussion is to get

1551
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,440
it right i'm not pretending it is right

1552
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,040
it is a starting point

1553
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:04,160
so section 5.1 is on adoption and

1554
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,480
implementation of standards

1555
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,079
just discusses the fact that

1556
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,160
standardization should not be a tool to

1557
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,839
suppress competition

1558
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,520
that covers a nu and then we go through

1559
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,280
a whole bunch of different aspects of

1560
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,960
that

1561
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,400
tries to recognize we do have one of the

1562
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,160
changes we did was try to recognize that

1563
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,319
there are nuances in all of this so at

1564
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:27,200
the end there's even a note

1565
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,400
that

1566
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,200
people using standards to make choices

1567
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,359
is

1568
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:36,160
okay sorry that's a different point that

1569
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,079
discussing the aspect of whether folks

1570
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:40,160
will use the standard is an important

1571
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,079
discussion

1572
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,760
we don't want to waste our time on a

1573
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,319
standard nobody's going to implement and

1574
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:48,319
balancing that with the other

1575
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:49,599
constraints in the section is

1576
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,200
non-trivial but is important

1577
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,119
5.2 is exchange of competitive

1578
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,200
information this is what people

1579
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,520
classically think of as antitrust it

1580
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,440
turns out there are multiple clauses in

1581
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,640
the antitrust and competition laws and

1582
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,400
the question brian raised a question of

1583
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,319
the exact title of the document i'll

1584
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,880
i'll leave that for discussion and check

1585
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,720
with lawyers who deal with international

1586
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,240
law because i don't know what the

1587
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,559
international terms are we can fix the

1588
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,640
title that's not a big deal

1589
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,960
but in exchanges of competitive

1590
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,319
information are an important category of

1591
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:28,720
informa of issues here

1592
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,760
uh we list nine different items and then

1593
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,920
we tried to put in caveats things like

1594
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,760
well if it's already public obviously

1595
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,680
you could talk about it

1596
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,799
uh

1597
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:42,079
we need we do recognize in the text that

1598
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:44,240
there are some times when costs are an

1599
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,079
important aspect of

1600
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:47,359
evaluating whether something is

1601
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:49,520
reasonable to standardize

1602
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,599
and yet discussing what the actual cost

1603
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,520
is to manufacture things is

1604
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,559
a big no-no so how do we balance that

1605
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,799
precisely we've

1606
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,799
suggested a set of guidelines

1607
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,559
wordsmithing is again

1608
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,559
what would be needed but there are a lot

1609
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:06,000
of things in there that people don't

1610
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,200
realize can be significant issues so

1611
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,200
getting it spelled out for people seems

1612
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,160
to me to be very important

1613
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,720
5.3 is a section about market

1614
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,160
requirements and

1615
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,160
basically this is the lawyers told me

1616
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,680
this turns out to be an area that

1617
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,680
matters if you do this you can be seen

1618
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,319
as as trying to collude to influence the

1619
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:27,359
market

1620
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,119
and yet we do need to know what people

1621
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,119
want and what the market wants

1622
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:33,440
so my guess is this is one that is

1623
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,359
probably needs more wordsmithing than

1624
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,680
the others

1625
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,839
but

1626
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,599
it is actually an important per

1627
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,680
dimension of antitrust and

1628
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,520
anti-competitive behavior that needs to

1629
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,160
be dealt with

1630
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,400
5.4 i've simply quoted here what we put

1631
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,520
in

1632
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,319
but people who are from a company that

1633
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:58,079
ha that is seen to have a dominant

1634
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:59,599
market position it doesn't matter

1635
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,119
whether it's really dominant doesn't

1636
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:03,680
matter whether it thinks it's dominant

1637
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,520
but if it's seen by others to have a

1638
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,319
dominant position which to me means

1639
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:10,079
just be careful no matter who you're

1640
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:11,520
from because you never know how people

1641
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,559
will see you

1642
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:15,280
need to be very careful about using the

1643
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,160
authority we give them to lead things

1644
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,039
for corporate goals yeah we have things

1645
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,720
that say everybody's work should be to

1646
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,520
the benefit of the internet

1647
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,480
i know of plenty of cases and i'm sure

1648
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,160
many of you do too

1649
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,640
where people sure seem to be working for

1650
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,720
other goals and

1651
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,119
we need to make clear to folks both to

1652
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:38,960
protect them to protect the rest of us

1653
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,880
in the room and to protect

1654
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,039
the community as a whole the ietf and

1655
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:46,559
even isak that you can't do that now we

1656
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:49,280
can i can't make it a rule because i'm

1657
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,240
not trying to write rules because

1658
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,079
if this is all legal stuff with more

1659
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:55,839
nuances than you can shake a stick at

1660
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:57,680
trying to write rules would be a wasted

1661
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,078
time

1662
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:02,400
but

1663
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,520
and

1664
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:08,000
but we need we need some form of advice

1665
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,520
so then what do we want to do i'm trying

1666
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,400
to get go through this expeditiously

1667
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,400
um

1668
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,520
i i i'm gonna actually interrupt myself

1669
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,520
and comment on a thing i just saw in the

1670
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,920
chat yes some people may feel they can't

1671
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,839
discuss this

1672
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:27,839
but i would hate for us to conclude we

1673
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:31,359
can't give people advice on how to

1674
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:34,240
behave better with regard to antitrust

1675
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,960
and how to avoid common pitfalls

1676
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,640
because people can't figure out how to

1677
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,240
have the discussion

1678
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,960
that just hurts my head

1679
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,039
because this is really important and it

1680
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:46,240
really

1681
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,319
judging from other standards bodies we

1682
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,640
need to address it somehow

1683
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,799
and i don't want to just say well

1684
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:54,319
the lawyer should go off into a back

1685
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,480
room and give us advice

1686
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:00,240
this needs to be a community result

1687
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,480
and uh

1688
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,720
so i i tried to put on the this last

1689
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,480
slide

1690
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,039
what were our choices we could choose to

1691
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:12,160
do nothing i really hope we don't i

1692
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,079
haven't been complaining about this as

1693
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,720
long as john has but

1694
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,640
i think this is important and we need to

1695
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,240
do it

1696
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,319
we could just ask an ad to sponsor a

1697
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:24,880
document in the classic fashion but

1698
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,880
from where i said this needs community

1699
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,240
discussion

1700
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,880
if it needs community discussion

1701
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,599
the classic id sponsorship is not good

1702
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,119
enough

1703
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:37,839
so we need some sort of venue to discuss

1704
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:38,720
it

1705
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,119
and when that venue leads to agreement

1706
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:42,000
then

1707
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,440
gets published

1708
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,920
either as a.d sponsored or as a working

1709
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,799
group document or something but we need

1710
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:50,240
a venue

1711
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,720
at the same time the notion of spinning

1712
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,599
up an entire working group to discuss

1713
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,920
this one document

1714
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,680
that is very short

1715
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,680
unfortunately not easy to discuss but

1716
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,520
very short

1717
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,119
seems

1718
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:07,520
odd but if that's what everybody wants i

1719
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,920
guess i'll live with that and

1720
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,680
i i don't want to hijack the gen

1721
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,079
dispatch list to the endless discussion

1722
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:17,039
to an endless discussion of this

1723
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:19,839
but i feel like we need some sort of a

1724
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:21,520
venue

1725
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,400
and

1726
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,960
colin well well the result might be that

1727
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,200
the iedf doesn't agree

1728
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:31,038
that clearly is not advice to anybody

1729
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,440
okay thank you very much joel

1730
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,440
john's point was to just point to this

1731
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,200
in the note well not to try to put all

1732
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,000
of this into the note well we can't

1733
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,160
there's too much but i just wanted to

1734
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,480
make a point but my suggestion would be

1735
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,079
we write the document which is

1736
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:50,000
relatively short but sure not short

1737
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,920
enough to fit on one slide and then we

1738
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:52,880
add a

1739
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,079
pay attention to antitrust issues cbcp 7

1740
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:58,799
or c informational rfc

1741
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:01,799
9765.

1742
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:04,960
okay we have a line of people and i'll

1743
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,680
let the chairs manage the microphone

1744
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,200
thank you thanks joel for your

1745
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,760
presentation for bringing this so just a

1746
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,599
reminder to add yourself to the queue

1747
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:16,000

1749
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,920
slides that we showed about noting

1750
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,319
things really well do be considerate um

1751
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:24,160
off the dispatch question we're not

1752
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,000
trying to work out the exact wording or

1753
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
anything here we are just trying to find

1754
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,680
the best avenue or the best route

1755
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,440
forward for this work if you think it

1756
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,160
should go forward and so please do keep

01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,160
your answers brief and focused on the

1758
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,440
dispatch question um or ask clarifying

1759
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,039
questions and we'll just go right down

01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,880
you know the iatf has has tackled

1766
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,640
documents like i'm sorry

1767
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,520

uh the itf is tackled document

1770
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,240
okay the idf has tackled documents like

1771
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,400
this before uh you know our ipr

1772
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,680
documents uh you know this this is a

1773
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,079
similar sort of uh situation you know

1774
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:17,520
when we when we've done the ipr

1775
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,920
documents usually the lawyers come into

1776
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,160
the room and help they help word smith

1777
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,000
i would expect

1778
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,200
much the same here if we create a venue

1779
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,000
that the the lawyers would show up um

1780
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,160
from various companies to make sure that

1781
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,559
uh their employees aren't put in a

1782
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:36,400
in any sort of conflict

1783
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,319
in terms of participating in terms of

1784
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:39,839
participation

1785
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:42,720
in anticipation of this coming up here

1786
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,160
and actually in reaction to the

1787
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,079
announcement i actually had our our

1788
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:47,760
legal people reviewed and basically said

1789
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,920
it was motherhood and apple pie so i

1790
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,000
didn't really have a particular grand

1791
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,200
concern

1792
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,640
um

1793
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,880
my uh suggestion as to what to do with

1794
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:57,760
it

1795
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,280
um

1796
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,280
this is a pretty focused

1797
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,119
effort that we're talking about

1798
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:04,960
um

1799
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,039
in in times when we were meeting i would

1800
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,559
say this is not one of those where you

1801
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:10,799
really need to get people too too often

1802
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:13,839
into a room um what i would have said is

1803
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,440
we'd create something like we had in the

1804
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,080
apps area uh that alexa used to run

1805
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,000
which is a mini working group

1806
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,080
um where basically is general it was

1807
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,799
expected to be remote attendance uh you

1808
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:27,439
know email only and i think a targeted

1809
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:29,839
working group in this case would get the

1810
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,279
job done and i think it would bring in

1811
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,040
the right people to get the job done and

1812
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,640
if people couldn't participate you know

1813
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,319
because they didn't feel comfortable

1814
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:37,520
that's fine there'll be enough people

1815
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,198
who do

1816
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,519
thank you

1817
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:45,120
thank you very much elliot so your

1818
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,399
recommendation would be a targeted

1819
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:48,560
working group and to take the word for

1820
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,399
work forward

1821
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:52,719
uh a target or a mini working group that

1822
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,719
if if lars wants to run something you

1823
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:57,120
know the way that alexa ran it and lars

1824
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,719
you can talk to alexa about it in terms

1825
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:01,679
of how he handled that

1826
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:06,198
great thank you

1827
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:14,080
permissions can you hear me now

1828
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:15,679
yes i can hear you

1829
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:17,040
okay lovely

1830
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,359
um so joel uh

1831
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:20,880
as i understand it

1832
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,560
you know when when standards bodies put

1833
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,080
out anti-trust

1834
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,319
or competition law statements

1835
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,799
they're usually targeted at

1836
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:31,198
protecting the organization from from

1837
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:34,238
from violating or being prosecuted for

1838
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:36,158
for for violations

1839
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:37,920
uh

1840
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,719
couching this as advice to participants

1841
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:42,799
makes me really nervous

1842
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:44,880
um because we don't have the expertise

1843
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,080
to do that

1844
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,279
and

1845
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,920
you know i'm also concerned about the

1846
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,640
the jurisdiction aspect here where

1847
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,480
european competition law works in a very

1848
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,840
different way than american competition

1849
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,760
law and this document feels

1850
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,840
kind of american right now and then

1851
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,199
you've got you know australia doing

1852
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,040
interesting stuff and and other

1853
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,320
jurisdictions so i i guess i'm just i'm

1854
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,560
i'm a little concerned about this

1855
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,320
if like like elliott said as it

1856
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,840
currently sits it's it's largely

1857
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,000
motherhood and apple pie it's all

1858
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,520
largely focused on you know understood

1859
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,120
competition law issues instead of

1860
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,719
studies around cartel behavior and and

1861
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,320
patents

1862
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,320
but all the all the discussions these

1863
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:29,120
days are about new forms of abuse which

1864
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,400
haven't really seen their way through

1865
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,640
the system yet and aren't really defined

1866
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,600
so

1867
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,520
i i'm a little concerned that we open

1868
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,880
this thing up to a working group

1869
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,640
actually i'm really concerned that if we

1870
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:39,920
open this up to a working group we're

1871
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,120
going to end up with a document that has

1872
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,640
no real

1873
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,400
bearing on reality

1874
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,320
when it comes to court and participants

1875
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,120
are going to feel you know misled by it

1876
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:52,159
so from for this patch question

1877
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,320
i i think we need a different document

1878
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,320
uh i think we need something much more

1879
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,840
about what protects the itf from nona

1880
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,760
anti-trust or competition law

1881
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,040
prosecution

1882
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,800
and

1883
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,719
if we do have a group work on it it

1884
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:08,719
probably needs to be sponsored and get a

1885
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,960
few lawyers in to talk about it but

1886
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,640
having this community come up with what

1887
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,560
it thinks is the right thing is just

1888
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,679
spells disaster to me

1889
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:19,840
okay i

1890
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,960
i missed

1891
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,520
i i missed a connection between parts of

1892
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,360
what you said i understand your

1893
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,360
perspective and that's we're here to

1894
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,640
listen to that

1895
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:29,600
but

1896
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,840
and the the point was we were picking

1897
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,440
things that were

1898
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,280
generally applicable not

1899
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,960
trying to deal with cutting-edge things

1900
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,239
that some people

1901
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,719
some jurisdictions may be introducing to

1902
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:43,040
further complicate it we're not claiming

1903
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,760
this is comprehensive god help us i we

1904
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,320
can't be comprehensive

1905
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,440
um

1906
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,480
but

1907
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,040
you may be un overestimating under a

1908
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,760
three i'm not sure which way

1909
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,280
an awful lot of people don't even

1910
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,159
realize the basics which is why i felt

1911
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:02,480
it was very helpful to call this out

1912
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,560
and from what i've been told having a

1913
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,880
statement from the body that says

1914
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,880
these are the things we expect even if

1915
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,000
we're not making rules about them

1916
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,640
does make a big difference in the way it

1917
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,080
is seen by

1918
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,239
multiple enforcement authorities around

1919
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:19,440
the world

1920
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,600
it's part of why i'm trying to do this

1921
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,520
because it does affect

1922
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,600
help protect the body not just the

1923
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,880
individuals

1924
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,239
but

1925
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:29,840
just thought i should try to clarify

1926
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,840
that because i was you seem to be both

1927
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,719
saying

1928
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:35,360
it's too general and too specific

1929
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,640
i mean a working group can go off the

1930
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:40,000
rails but that's a different problem

1931
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,320
yeah so i've noted mark nottingham's

1932
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,840
kind of recommendation as maybe a.d

1933
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,239
sponsored and kind of pay lawyers and

1934
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:49,679
having a working group might lead to

1935
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,159
something maybe not so useful

1936
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:55,760
um so thank you uh phillip helen baker

1937
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,520
did not do it

1938
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:01,040
yeah i i i would also go for the um

1939
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,960
ad-sponsored route

1940
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,480
and here's why i mean

1941
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,600
i

1942
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,000
i i was i've been pushing for this for

1943
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
quite a few years now in response to a

1944
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,120
specific incident in another working in

1945
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,800
another standards body that i don't want

1946
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,320
to go into

1947
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,880
it is my expectation

1948
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,159
that uh

1949
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:21,760
employees of certain companies are going

1950
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,040
to be getting mandatory antitrust

1951
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,080
training

1952
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,080
in the very near future

1953
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,239
just like they get mandatory many other

1954
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,159
things training

1955
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,760
and so the first thing that i'm

1956
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,360
concerned about is

1957
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:38,159
does the ietf put up a notice

1958
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:42,239
that reminds these people that

1959
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:43,840
that they need to

1960
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,120
think in

1961
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,760
terms of that antitrust training they've

1962
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,239
been given from their employer

1963
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:51,199
and so

1964
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:53,600
my biggest concern actually is that no

1965
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,040
well

1966
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,640
actually has some specific mention

1967
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,360
including the words anti-trust and

1968
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:02,880
anti-monopoly

1969
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,239
so that participants are reminded

1970
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:08,800
that they've got to think in terms of

1971
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,840
what their

1972
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,679
uh company has already told them

1973
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,840
hey thank you phillip hearing from you

1974
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,320
as well ad sponsorship and a few people

1975
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:26,159
in jabba are agreeing that

1976
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,719
yep go for it

1977
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:40,560
okay so from my perspective

1978
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,800
this document is incredibly important i

1979
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,640
really do believe in the intent of this

1980
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,400
document

1981
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,400
i also however believe that it needs a

1982
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,239
lot more community input rather than

1983
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:53,199
just an ad sponsorship

1984
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:55,040
because the issues here are complex

1985
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:59,600
there are multiple restrictions involved

1986
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,640
the antitrust laws i do feel differ from

1987
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,719
case to case and i

1988
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:07,760
in anticipation of this

1989
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,600
was discussing this document with a

1990
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,159
number of operators

1991
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:14,960
and even in the current text which

1992
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,040
people have referred to as you know kind

1993
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,159
of

1994
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:19,920
fairly stock standard

1995
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,920
there were already a number of concerns

1996
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,679
that i think that

1997
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:27,280
people would like to give input on

1998
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,159
and so while i fully support the intent

1999
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:32,159
of the document and

2000
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:33,840
i think it's an incredibly important

2001
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,040
document

2002
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:38,880
i think because of the nuances involved

2003
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,159
it would be

2004
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:43,280
a good idea to have a fairly wide forum

2005
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,760
and what i would suggest

2006
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,080
is that we encourage

2007
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,320
participants in the ietf who aren't

2008
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,960
necessarily legal minds to go and get

2009
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:55,360
their legal minds to participate and

2010
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,800
look at this from the multiple

2011
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,679
jurisdictions because as i said

2012
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:02,400
there are aspects of this where

2013
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,920
things are different from country to

2014
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,120
country

2015
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,080
and there are also aspects of this that

2016
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:12,080
could fairly negatively impact people

2017
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,080
if done incorrectly because even while

2018
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,960
they are stated as guidelines

2019
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,080
i've seen guidelines be used in

2020
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,480
contesting everything from

2021
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,760
actions taken by private companies to

2022
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,560
rfps being overturned to goodness knows

2023
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,960
what and i do think that we need to be

2024
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,280
careful we need the document but we need

2025
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,640
it with wide input to consider all the

2026
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,880
perspectives and make sure we're going

2027
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,400
in the right direction

2028
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,440
so my view on this would be that it

2029
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,800
probably needs a focused working group

2030
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,840
to get it done right

2031
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,360
thank you for your view andrew i'm just

2032
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,120
going to invite brad biddle to speak

2033
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,040
next um as one of the co-authors on the

2034
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,880
draft and maybe respond to some of the

2035
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,600
questions that been raised

2036
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,400
great hopefully my audio is good um

2037
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,159
uh yes so for the folks who don't know

2038
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:10,719
me i am uh part of the legal team that

2039
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:13,600
serves as legal counsel to ietf llc and

2040
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,920
to the bodies that sit under that legal

2041
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,480
framework um and then also uh to the

2042
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,960
ietf trust

2043
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,640
and um

2044
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,840
i i know there have been a bunch of

2045
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,760
questions have been raised i i'm not

2046
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:26,960
even sure if i have them all kind of

2047
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,000
queued up in my mind to to to address uh

2048
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,840
specifically but maybe a little bit of

2049
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,239
background that might be helpful um

2050
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:36,800
i think from from my perspective uh as

2051
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,400
council to l uh to the itf um

2052
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,280
i

2053
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:42,400
i actually would be reasonably

2054
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,640
comfortable with the uh

2055
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,640
a policy that just says

2056
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,360
uh our our uh

2057
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:52,560
our policy is we abide by antitrust law

2058
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,280
um and that can be and and but i think

2059
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,880
we've had a sense that uh that the

2060
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,800
community wants more specific guidance

2061
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,760
than that

2062
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:00,960
so that's i think an interesting

2063
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,280
discussion point is you know is that

2064
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,960
that additional guidance essentially all

2065
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:07,040
of section 5 that provides some more

2066
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,600
specific guidelines for behavior

2067
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:13,520
the you know the utility of that for um

2068
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:16,159
purposes of giving community a sense of

2069
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:17,520
what kind of behavior is appropriate

2070
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,280
inappropriate i think that's a

2071
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,360
completely legitimate discussion

2072
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,239
uh and i can see the argument for uh

2073
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:26,640
that that there's usefulness to that

2074
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,679
approach

2075
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:30,239
i think purely from my legal perspective

2076
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:33,040
you know i look at this from um

2077
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,239
there's a

2078
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:37,040
department of justice document that um

2079
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,880
talks about antitrust compliance

2080
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,960
programs not just antitrust policies but

2081
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,280
antitrust compliance programs and and

2082
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:44,800
that really is the framework that i

2083
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,159
think of when i'm

2084
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:48,159
my my firm we we support a number of

2085
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:50,320
different standards organizations and

2086
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,640
um and and generally we think of this as

2087
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,360
what is our antitrust compliance program

2088
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,719
having a policy is is a piece of that

2089
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:00,560
the policy you know especially when you

2090
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:01,840
read this department of justice

2091
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,000
guidelines can really be simple and i

2092
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,600
saw some discussion in the chat about

2093
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,320
the w3c policy which i actually like a

2094
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,040
lot and uh credit to wendy for frankly

2095
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,920
being the author of that um i think that

2096
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,719
would suffice from my perspective to

2097
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:18,320
sort of check that box of we have a

2098
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:19,600
policy

2099
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,840
that uh that that

2100
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,760
you know states clearly that

2101
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,840
uh we comply with the law and then give

2102
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,840
some mechanisms for people to escalate

2103
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,440
anti-trust concerns

2104
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,280
so that's the sort of narrow approach

2105
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,239
here

2106
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:34,480
uh as as i mentioned i do think there's

2107
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,560
some utility in giving people more

2108
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,199
specific behavioral guidelines i do they

2109
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:40,880
think there is some trickiness with you

2110
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,040
know behavioral guidelines um in terms

2111
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,719
of international you know international

2112
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:46,239
laws being potentially different and so

2113
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:48,239
forth i don't think they're so different

2114
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:50,000
that we we can't do this you know so i

2115
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,480
think the stuff that will work in

2116
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:55,040
in you know the maps to us law

2117
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,120
maps you know um

2118
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,440
generally equally well to you know the

2119
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:01,440
laws of other major jurisdictions so i

2120
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,760
think i think we could successfully you

2121
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,760
know find a set of criteria that would

2122
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,920
would work to um

2123
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,520
to you know lay out kind of you know

2124
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,920
relatively generic but specific enough

2125
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,760
guidelines that it hopefully gets to the

2126
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:14,719
point that

2127
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:16,800
uh joel has that we should really be

2128
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,560
more specific about what we communicate

2129
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,560
to to our participants

2130
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:22,960
so i'm sure i didn't answer all the

2131
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,000
questions that were raised but maybe

2132
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,520
i'll just pause there and see if other

2133
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,280
questions come up and just if nothing

2134
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,560
else just also indicate that i'm here

2135
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,239
i'm listening i was part of this

2136
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:31,679
drafting and

2137
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:33,360
and you know been you know interested to

2138
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,800
support this in whatever way makes sense

2139
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,360
going forward

2140
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:41,840
thank you very much brad i'm not seeing

2141
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,239
any questions pop up on jabba but um

2142
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:45,600
it's good that protestants know you're

2143
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,159
here so they can ask anything in there

2144
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:49,840
if if they have a question

2145
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,120
um so terrorist ekit to your next

2146
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,360
yeah um so where to start so probably

2147
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,280
this document is very important but it's

2148
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,840
really even unclear to me whether we can

2149
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,920
get away with one document right so the

2150
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,480
way i read it i wonder if this document

2151
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,880
is not really primarily to give guidance

2152
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,760
to the itf participants but really to

2153
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,000
protect the organization

2154
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,880
and that i think by itself is is a very

2155
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,600
valuable goal and maybe you know that

2156
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,600
ultimately could be two documents right

2157
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,560
because

2158
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,679
when i read something like section 5.2

2159
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:26,080
that sounds very much like something the

2160
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,880
ietf may need to defend itself like well

2161
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,120
we told our participants that

2162
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,880
these are the rules whether or not it

2163
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,719
helps the participants to understand

2164
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:37,520
what to do or you know when this doesn't

2165
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,560
apply like on a hallway or so isn't

2166
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,040
clear to me right and i i think we also

2167
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,120
heard that all these rules for the

2168
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,120
individual participants may be different

2169
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,960
in different jurisdictions um so um you

2170
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,360
know maybe maybe before getting to a

2171
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,679
point of um

2172
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:58,000
deciding you know what venue to actually

2173
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,400
use is you know what are about these

2174
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,000
conflicting goals protecting the

2175
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,679
organization and

2176
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:05,760
as a separate goal educating the

2177
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,400
participants um and the second one is

2178
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,719
for each of these goals what quark do we

2179
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:13,040
need right so i for example think that

2180
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:16,480
in many of these gen area things um the

2181
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,800
typical working group or id

2182
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,440
sponsored a quorum that we get with the

2183
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,840
rough consensus in the end

2184
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,159
isn't necessarily wide enough and so i

2185
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:28,400
do very much like the llc's approaches

2186
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,760
to create targeted questionnaires and so

2187
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,760
i think one of the things we certainly

2188
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,159
want to have is a feedback from people

2189
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:39,040
who you know for example can acclaim to

2190
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,120
having talked to their lawyers and

2191
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,520
gotten their feedback and take that into

2192
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,199
account in this case

2193
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,519
thank you

2194
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:50,880
thank you very much um so you're just to

2195
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,880
clarify your recommendation for

2196
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,920
dispatching would be

2197
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,159
for the discussion let's first figure

2198
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:01,040
out right um you know can we get the

2199
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:03,760
goals of protecting the organization and

2200
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,280
giving guidance to the participants

2201
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,600
ideally into a single document or should

2202
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,520
that be two documents even if they may

2203
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,840
not be all that different right but

2204
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,520
i think those are the two goals that we

2205
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,320
have not only educate the participants

2206
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,280
as the abstract of the document now says

2207
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,639
right but also to protect the

2208
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:25,360
organization so and and then the second

2209
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:28,239
one is what do we think is the quorum to

2210
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:31,120
to to get agreeing in the end right i

2211
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:31,920
mean

2212
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,560
how much feedback from whom do we need

2213
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,239
when we have an agreement on what that

2214
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:38,880
is i think we can most easily figure out

2215
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,800
which of the avenues that we have and

2216
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,800
maybe additional processes like

2217
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,360
questionnaires to the large community at

2218
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,920
all um would give us uh

2219
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,960
that quorum in the end

2220
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,040
okay thank you for clarifying yeah so

2221
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,600
i'm hearing from the discussion so far a

2222
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:56,639
few people

2223
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:59,360
came from sort of an a.d sponsored

2224
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,760
paying the lawyers asking the llc to do

2225
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:03,679
it and kind of the lawyers and the

2226
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:06,560
experts doing it and then um

2227
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,360
also a need for community consensus and

2228
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,600
sort of endorsement or agreement in some

2229
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,600
form and so

2230
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:14,800
that's what you're sort of saying to

2231
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,400
have like a something prepared and then

2232
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,560
a forum to kind of agree

2233
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,239
you know whatever that might be

2234
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:22,080
questionnaires or a range of means like

2235
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,320
that

2236
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,239
i think i've summarized that

2237
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:28,159
particularly you know i think it would

2238
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:30,239
be very helpful here if a lot of you

2239
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:32,239
know people from you know different

2240
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:34,560
countries and you know large versus a

2241
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,480
small organization would take it back to

2242
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,199
their lawyers and you know ask for their

2243
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,520
lawyers feedback how did we how do we

2244
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:42,840
get that

2245
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,920
done okay thank you very much thank you

2246
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,600
for your input

2247
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,080
um okay pete resnick you're next in the

2248
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,679
queue

2249
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:53,840
and i just want to say these comments

2250
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,600
are strictly with my

2251
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:56,480
hat

2252
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:59,840
as chair off these are from the floor

2253
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:00,800
um

2254
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,760
we

2255
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,560
had this discussion in a bath

2256
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:07,199
um not quite 10 years ago and the

2257
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:09,280
outcome of the buff was

2258
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,440
guidelines were what we should

2259
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,040
reasonably produce

2260
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,800
not policies

2261
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,120
now when brad got up to the mic he kept

2262
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,199
referring to policies

2263
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:21,120
and this document specifically says we

2264
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,360
are not making policy

2265
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,760
um i've talked to joel

2266
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,440
offline about

2267
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,360
the fact that i think this is

2268
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,280
inappropriate as bcp if it's not

2269
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,199
producing policies and there are a

2270
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:35,199
couple of statements in the document

2271
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:37,120
that sound like they're pushing toward

2272
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,320
policy

2273
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,639
i'd like to understand from brad whether

2274
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:43,679
a policy is required

2275
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:44,800
and

2276
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,000
whether that policy is going to

2277
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:48,800
be

2278
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,199
for participants which i don't think it

2279
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:53,440
should ever be or about protecting the

2280
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,719
organization

2281
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:55,840
which

2282
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,480
if there are reasons for a policy to do

2283
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,480
that sure we should talk about how

2284
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,080
that's gonna happen

2285
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,480
um but i would like brad to come to the

2286
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,760
mic and

2287
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,280
um say what he thinks about that because

2288
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,920
my understanding is we have always stood

2289
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,040
by the

2290
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:16,080
a policy is not necessary guidance is

2291
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,639
sufficient

2292
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,320
i'll just go ahead and jump in um

2293
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,159
yeah thanks pete when i use the word

2294
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:27,920
policy i'm probably using it a little

2295
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,159
bit loosely compared to sort of how that

2296
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:33,199
word is you might have it in your mind

2297
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:34,960
i think from my perspective

2298
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:37,120
the you know i think a lot about it

2299
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,719
through this filter of this department

2300
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:40,560
of justice document that i i mentioned

2301
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:41,440
um

2302
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:44,639
that uh that uh where you know that

2303
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:46,320
document talks about

2304
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:47,520
uh a

2305
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,120
company or some entity that's being

2306
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,480
investigated by the department of

2307
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:53,360
justice for on antitrust grounds

2308
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:54,960
uh would want to be able to point to the

2309
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,199
fact that they have a policy

2310
01:26:57,199 --> 01:26:59,920
uh but i think the way that that

2311
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,000
and that policy should be

2312
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,239
that the company complies with antitrust

2313
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:05,040
law

2314
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,840
uh and so

2315
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,400
i think that in the current draft you

2316
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,080
know we do state

2317
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,360
uh

2318
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,560
we have an expectation that all

2319
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,080
participants comply with the law when

2320
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:19,360
they're participating in in you know

2321
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,199
itf activities

2322
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:23,920
for me the last draft i saw by the way

2323
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,040
said

2324
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,199
participants must comply which sounds

2325
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:29,840
like a policy rather than are expected

2326
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,840
to comply which sounds like guidance

2327
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:36,910
i hear the point um

2328
01:27:36,910 --> 01:27:39,440
[Music]

2329
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:41,520
and the question it really is is it

2330
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,480
necessary to put it in the terms of must

2331
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,800
comply or is it sufficient to protect

2332
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:50,239
the organization to say are expected to

2333
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:51,760
that it is the responsibility of the

2334
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,920
participants not the responsibility of

2335
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,960
the organization to police

2336
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:59,440
all participant activities which is why

2337
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,840
i'm worried about policy

2338
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:04,560
in that sense

2339
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,880
yeah this is a pretty nuanced point and

2340
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,800
maybe maybe it's worth just queuing it

2341
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,280
up for for further discussion whatever

2342
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,560
forum we we end up taking this um

2343
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:17,440
i i mean my my quick answer would be

2344
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:20,000
i think are expected to could could be

2345
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,080
sufficient for the purposes of of you

2346
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,679
know if we ever had that moment where

2347
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:25,760
some antitrust investigator was

2348
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,520
raising concerns with

2349
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,679
activity in the itf and we

2350
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,440
could pull out this document that's uh

2351
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:34,800
that says look we we you know are we but

2352
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,040
everybody knows

2353
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,280
i think that could be good enough i i

2354
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,760
but i it was it was just purely me

2355
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,360
making a decision in the abstract and

2356
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,360
without itf history in context i'd say

2357
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,840
oh i like the musts i i think our policy

2358
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:48,960
should i mean

2359
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,560
from from the perspective of looking it

2360
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,920
through that filter

2361
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:55,280
i think something that says we we

2362
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:58,000
uh ietf participants must comply with

2363
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,719
the law is is the right substantive idea

2364
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:04,560
okay we'll we'll talk more about that

2365
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:05,600
the other

2366
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,000
point that i wanted to bring up is a lot

2367
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,600
of people are talking about bringing

2368
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,400
other attorneys from their own companies

2369
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,159
into this discussion and that is somehow

2370
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:16,480
important that seems like a horrible

2371
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,880
idea because what those attorneys want

2372
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:21,600
to do is limit their own liability by

2373
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:25,120
upping the ietf's liability

2374
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,199
and what we want to do is do things that

2375
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:29,760
are in the ietf's interest

2376
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,920
not in the companies that are sending

2377
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,320
participants they are responsible for

2378
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,400
getting their folks to comply with

2379
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:39,679
antitrust law we are only responsible as

2380
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:42,719
the ietf to make sure that we're doing

2381
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:45,679
what's right to cover our liability and

2382
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:49,040
i i think the idea that we should allow

2383
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:50,960
company lawyers to come in and inform

2384
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:55,440
that discussion is really a bad plan

2385
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,880
yeah i mean there's certainly the point

2386
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,120
that like so i or you know other folks

2387
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,440
on the team you know we are counsel to

2388
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,199
you know itf llc and the bodies

2389
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:05,760
underneath the llc um and that so we

2390
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:06,560
have

2391
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,560
you know our our fiduciary type duties

2392
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,360
are to the the you know to the llc and

2393
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,040
the itf um

2394
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,760
and uh and other lawyers who participate

2395
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,920
they have similar you know duties to

2396
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,320
their own clients and not to us and so

2397
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:23,120
so yes that's absolutely true

2398
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,880
i'm not i think i'm not as troubled by

2399
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,880
the idea as what you've articulated in

2400
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,360
the sense of i mean there are deep

2401
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,760
uh experts in you know antitrusts

2402
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,360
particularly trust related to standards

2403
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,199
in these different companies i think

2404
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:36,560
frame the right way that they are

2405
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,400
providing inputs

2406
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,960
uh and suggestions um but are not you

2407
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,880
know the decision makers about to you

2408
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,320
know sort of or and aren't providing

2409
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,639
legal advice to the ietf

2410
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:49,360
i i think it's a manageable uh

2411
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,199
issue if if we decided to go down that

2412
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:53,760
path and it's also fairly typical like

2413
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,920
as i mentioned before that we we we

2414
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:56,960
represent a number of different

2415
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,960
standards organizations um

2416
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,679
and uh and just the pragmatic reality is

2417
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:02,480
that

2418
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,960
uh often you know there are counsel from

2419
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,159
you know

2420
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:07,840
in those other cases you know member

2421
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:10,400
companies typically that participate in

2422
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,000
these kinds of discussions and so we

2423
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,560
have mechanisms for for managing that so

2424
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,360
so yes and i think we can we could we

2425
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:20,559
can manage that risk

2426
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,880
thank you brad i'm just noting that

2427
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,159
there's quite a lot of pushback in

2428
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:26,159
jabber um disagreeing with pete about

2429
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:27,280
bringing in

2430
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:28,320
um

2431
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,400
lawyers from their own companies and you

2432
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,840
can't prevent lawyers from coming to the

2433
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,280
discussions even if you even if you

2434
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:36,320
wanted to um pete can i just check your

2435
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,320
dispatch recommendation before we move

2436
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,880
down the queue

2437
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:44,719
without the chair hat on

2438
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:48,960
it would be something to say um i think

2439
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:49,920
that

2440
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,800
we can continue with a buff on this

2441
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:55,440
i think going straight to working group

2442
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:56,880
is a mistake

2443
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:57,840
um

2444
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,600
because i still think we have to

2445
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,199
establish

2446
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:03,840
what we are planning to work on here

2447
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,080
whether it is a set of guidelines

2448
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:06,800
or

2449
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,520
whether it is literally a policy and it

2450
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,360
sounds like people are waffling on what

2451
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,839
that is

2452
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:15,840
okay thank you very much for your

2453
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,120
recommendation

2454
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:21,199
um we'll go to elissa cooper next

2455
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,679
hey thanks um

2456
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:28,080
so i am going to agree with the

2457
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,159
distinction that torrelis made i thought

2458
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:31,840
that was quite useful i think it sounds

2459
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,239
like there's two motivations here one is

2460
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:35,600
to

2461
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,000
protect the ietf as an organization from

2462
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,719
potential liability and the other one is

2463
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:42,000
to

2464
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
educate participants

2465
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,480
about how their behavior interacts with

2466
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:49,040
antitrust and competition law and those

2467
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,519
i think

2468
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,280
seem like they weren't different

2469
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:56,719
approaches so i thought the

2470
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:59,199
call out to the w3c statement was very

2471
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:01,040
useful and and very much you know

2472
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:02,560
aligned to what brad was talking about

2473
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,239
in terms of like these simple statements

2474
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:06,159
that sdos make

2475
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:08,080
if it seems like we need one of those in

2476
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,920
the ietf because

2477
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,000
um antitrust authorities are getting

2478
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,920
more interested in standards development

2479
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,840
organizations then that seems like

2480
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,840
something that the llc could take care

2481
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,840
of you know short policy

2482
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,639
um put it out for comment um the same

2483
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:24,800
way that they've done with the other 17

2484
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,199
policies that the llc has adopted um

2485
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:28,480
obviously would get a lot of attention

2486
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:29,840
from the community but there's a

2487
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,520
feedback loop for that and doesn't need

2488
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,239
to

2489
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:34,000
live in an rfc or go through a working

2490
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,040
group process um much in the same way

2491
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,880
the other llc policies don't and that

2492
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,120
would be the purpose of it is is for

2493
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:43,199
that liability

2494
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:45,440
coverage case for the organization as a

2495
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:46,719
whole

2496
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:49,040
and then on the other hand for

2497
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,400
educating participants i'm not sure that

2498
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,800
an rfc is a great way to do that either

2499
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,800
it's a little bit of a more dynamic

2500
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:59,440
scenario and so i think one of the

2501
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,440
results of the both

2502
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,440
nine years ago last time it was

2503
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:04,719
discussed

2504
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:06,480
was that there should be more like

2505
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,360
training for participants and i posted a

2506
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,120
link to the slides that

2507
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:13,120
the ietf council at the time george

2508
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,639
contreras had done

2509
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:16,480
for that both

2510
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:17,280
and

2511
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,960
to me that's maybe a more interesting

2512
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,840
avenue than an rfc whereby you know brad

2513
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:24,400
could put together some some slides and

2514
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,719
um and present them and really have it

2515
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:27,440
be

2516
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:29,600
um you know not even lowercase normative

2517
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,159
but just explaining to people what the

2518
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:34,480
landscape is what the types of things

2519
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:37,440
are um that you know behaviors and other

2520
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:40,000
situations um that have have caused

2521
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,320
problems um and leave it at that if

2522
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,080
there's really a need for for people to

2523
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:46,560
get better educated about um the

2524
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:49,440
landscape out there but i think the ietf

2525
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:50,800
uh you know the document says it isn't

2526
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,560
giving legal advice but then it like

2527
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,719
goes through a whole bunch of um you

2528
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:56,400
know lowercase normative statements

2529
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:59,119
about about what should happen um that's

2530
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:01,520
to me seems like overstepping

2531
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:02,960
what um

2532
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,480
you know what should be happening from

2533
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,080
an organizational perspective and if you

2534
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:07,440
really do need legal advice you should

2535
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,440
get it from your own counsel and and not

2536
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,400
from the itf um but a general um kind of

2537
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:15,199
education campaign

2538
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:17,040
conducted by the itf council i think is

2539
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:20,199
more appropriate

2540
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,880
i'm not hearing anybody

2541
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,840
colin i think you're up

2542
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:56,480
okay um so yeah so uh

2543
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:59,920
obviously uh i'm i'm not a lawyer so

2544
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,560
feel free to tell me i'm very confused

2545
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,159
at this point

2546
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:05,119
um

2547
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:09,199
as a participant um i agree that um some

2548
01:36:09,199 --> 01:36:11,040
guidelines and some education on this

2549
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:14,560
topic is a very useful thing

2550
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:18,159
um i'm perhaps a little concerned though

2551
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:22,480
that this document is just focused on

2552
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:26,480
one aspect of the process

2553
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,239
and it talks solely about the the

2554
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:30,400
standards development in the ietf part

2555
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,719
of the organization

2556
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:35,679
and i think i understand why that is

2557
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:38,080
but i wonder if it should also be

2558
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:40,000
thinking about some of the interactions

2559
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,360
with the different parts of the

2560
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:44,159
organization

2561
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:47,679
for example the irtf doesn't

2562
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:49,920
develop standards but there are clearly

2563
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:52,560
close interactions between the ietf and

2564
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,800
the irtf

2565
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,199
and we have some itf groups building on

2566
01:36:57,199 --> 01:36:58,800
some of the research results in their

2567
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,000
standards

2568
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,320
and we see work moving between the ietf

2569
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:03,920
and the irtf

2570
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:07,119
in both directions quite frequently

2571
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:08,320
and it's fairly clear that some of the

2572
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,800
things that the irtf does do affect the

2573
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,960
outcomes of of the standards

2574
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,800
sometimes directly sometimes indirectly

2575
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,119
um similarly i see

2576
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:21,440
some of the iab programs taking recently

2577
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:24,080
broad input from the community

2578
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:26,480
i see some independent stream documents

2579
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:29,119
significantly impacting and influencing

2580
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:30,880
the itf process

2581
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,639
and some reasonably close interactions

2582
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:35,360
between the the itf uh

2583
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:37,760
um the iab the independent stream and so

2584
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,360
on

2585
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:40,639
uh all these different parts of the

2586
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:42,159
organization have very different

2587
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:45,520
processes to the itf uh and that they're

2588
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:47,119
set up in different ways and perhaps

2589
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:48,960
provide different protections for the

2590
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,840
organization and for the participants

2591
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,920
but they act with the standards process

2592
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,600
and interact with standards processing

2593
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:58,480
in quite subtle and complex ways

2594
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,880
so i i think some guidance would be be

2595
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,639
useful here some education would be

2596
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:03,920
useful here

2597
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,600
but i do wonder if the current draft is

2598
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:06,960
perhaps uh

2599
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,520
more narrowly focused than it should be

2600
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,920
thank you

2601
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,280
thank you colin and sorry for the

2602
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:17,040
problems with my audio just before but

2603
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,119
um thank you for your input and you've

2604
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:21,600
united so i have closed the queue um

2605
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,440
just in the interest of time so we'll

2606
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:27,519
hear from wendy seltzer next

2607
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:31,679
let's see if i can make this work um

2608
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:32,560
so

2609
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:36,800
wendy seltzer i am uh w3c council and uh

2610
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:42,080
also uh liaison with etf and uh so the

2611
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:46,320
uh anti w3c's antitrust guidance as we

2612
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:50,480
uh noted in the the chat um is

2613
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,800
relatively concise and

2614
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,600
uh

2615
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:55,600
while we've had some discussions within

2616
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:59,199
w3c about the possibly

2617
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:01,119
expanding on that

2618
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:03,280
we haven't had consensus to

2619
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:06,000
open it up and uh say more

2620
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,040
and

2621
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,560
uh

2622
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:10,239
as some others have noted the the

2623
01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:12,960
difficulty of uh of having a public

2624
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,560
conversation about legal topics um and

2625
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,000
the sense that

2626
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,440
you know

2627
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:20,560
the

2628
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,880
most of the legal guidance participants

2629
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:26,159
uh need uh has to come from uh from

2630
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:28,080
their own council because

2631
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,639
uh the standards bodies council is not

2632
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:33,679
uh your council and yeah

2633
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:36,000
uh uh so i would

2634
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,719
i think echo uh what alyssa suggested

2635
01:39:38,719 --> 01:39:39,600
that

2636
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,600
the llc

2637
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:44,080
offer some guidance and

2638
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,639
the participants who have questions or

2639
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:49,119
comments for that

2640
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:50,719
should

2641
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:52,880
give input there on

2642
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:55,840
how it's serving their needs um as well

2643
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:56,560
as

2644
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:59,199
some general educational material to to

2645
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:02,080
help people in general understand

2646
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:04,880
good conduct

2647
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:10,000
thank you very much wendy um really

2648
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,600
appreciate your input there

2649
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:13,199
i will just move down the queue so

2650
01:40:13,199 --> 01:40:15,760
richard barnes your next

2651
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:18,239
yeah thanks um and i think alyssa and

2652
01:40:18,239 --> 01:40:19,840
wendy kind of hit most of what i was

2653
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,199
going to say so i'm just going to kind

2654
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:23,040
of yes and then on a couple of points i

2655
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:24,560
think this distinction between policy

2656
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:27,280
and guidelines is pretty crucial here

2657
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:31,119
uh i think alyssa's proposal that we

2658
01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:32,800
kind of treat this policy as the other

2659
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,000
policies

2660
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,320
the llc has developed is kind of the

2661
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,639
right procedural approach for the policy

2662
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,880
half of this um so kind of using that

2663
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:42,480
policy development mechanism and the

2664
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:44,239
community feedback mechanism as the

2665
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:45,199
vector

2666
01:40:45,199 --> 01:40:46,960
um to pete's point about involving other

2667
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,159
companies lawyers um i think that i i am

2668
01:40:50,159 --> 01:40:51,760
pretty much all the way on the other

2669
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,520
side of the issue from pete um i think

2670
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,360
this is a domain where it would be

2671
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,040
useful for the llc's council to be

2672
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:59,199
engaging with the councils from other

2673
01:40:59,199 --> 01:41:02,880
organizations who participate so that um

2674
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:05,440
those organizations uh yeah as jay said

2675
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:06,719
in the chat like their those

2676
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:08,239
organizations antitrust fosters are

2677
01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:11,119
intertwined with the ietf's uh antitrust

2678
01:41:11,119 --> 01:41:13,199
posture uh and so i think it makes sense

2679
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:14,639
to have those discussions obviously with

2680
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:17,440
the ietf uh and their council as kind of

2681
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,040
the lead in that discussion and

2682
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:21,280
ultimately the producer of the output

2683
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,719
but i think we should absolutely have

2684
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:25,199
those discussions um kind of counsel to

2685
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:26,400
council

2686
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,040
on the guidelines front um i i think

2687
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:32,159
brad uh kind of proposed the the idea of

2688
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:34,320
a compliance program and i think that's

2689
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:35,600
i think that's the right umbrella to

2690
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:38,159
think about on the kind of education uh

2691
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:40,800
materials that also was suggesting

2692
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:41,920
um i'm

2693
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,840
a bit less sanguine than that than i

2694
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,760
think i was i was reading alyssa ads um

2695
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,639
i think it's probably i'm super wary of

2696
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:50,560
the ietf providing anything that would

2697
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,800
even have the appearance of legal advice

2698
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:53,600
here

2699
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,840
um further exactly the reason wendy's is

2700
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,159
like the ietf is not

2701
01:41:58,159 --> 01:42:00,000
your lawyer the icf council is not your

2702
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,679
lawyer you need to work with your lawyer

2703
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:03,920
to understand how you need to behave

2704
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:05,520
so um if there was anything to do in

2705
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:06,719
this education thing it wouldn't

2706
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:09,199
necessarily be super high level and and

2707
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:11,360
rfc would almost certainly be the the

2708
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:12,960
wrong way to do it so i think what i'm

2709
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,639
at a high level i'm taking away there is

2710
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:17,840
no rsc to develop here um there's barely

2711
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,480
any ietf process to engage here uh it's

2712
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:23,119
mainly an llc process

2713
01:42:23,119 --> 01:42:25,760
developing a policy and possibly some

2714
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:29,840
work uh developing an education program

2715
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:33,600
thank you very much richard um and

2716
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:35,040
thanks everyone for your engagement in

2717
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,119
jabba as well i'll try to summarize that

2718
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:40,159
just after we hear from joel

2719
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:41,119
okay

2720
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:44,080
a couple of points that i heard

2721
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,320
in this

2722
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:48,559
uh

2723
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:51,199
whatever brad's mixed policy and

2724
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:53,920
guidelines it is we have been very clear

2725
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:55,600
from the beginning of this work that it

2726
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,840
is intended as guidelines we're not

2727
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:01,760
setting policy we're not setting rules

2728
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,679
that's because otherwise

2729
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:05,840
we get into lots of mess

2730
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:06,639
um

2731
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:08,080
i'll come back

2732
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,080
i want to comment on

2733
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:12,239
colin's question

2734
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:14,239
regarding rtf the practice we found

2735
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:15,440
useful

2736
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:18,719
is to figure out the ietf side and then

2737
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:20,639
let the irtf

2738
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:22,480
use that as a base and then adjust it to

2739
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:25,440
suit their needs rather than trying

2740
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,360
to have the ietf to find something for

2741
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:29,440
the irtf because the idf does not

2742
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:32,400
actually have jurisdiction over

2743
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:35,119
the irtf so while

2744
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:37,920
i mean i i work i helped work out the

2745
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:40,239
ipr rules for ietf and then i worked

2746
01:43:40,239 --> 01:43:42,239
with the irtf chair

2747
01:43:42,239 --> 01:43:45,360
to help work out the ipr rules for the

2748
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:46,719
irtf

2749
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:49,119
because well you need them but they're

2750
01:43:49,119 --> 01:43:50,800
subtly different

2751
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:53,040
so i'm not too worried about i'd rather

2752
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:56,159
keep this scoped to the ietf

2753
01:43:56,159 --> 01:43:58,080
and that gets us to the third point

2754
01:43:58,080 --> 01:43:59,199
which is

2755
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:00,960
one of the things that caused me to

2756
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:03,840
start embarking on this was when the llc

2757
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:06,560
put out a statement about this because

2758
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,880
either the statement is about the llc

2759
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:10,639
itself in which case it is irrelevant to

2760
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:13,280
the ietf and ietf participants

2761
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:14,239
or

2762
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:16,800
the statement is actually about ietf and

2763
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,520
the ietf standard development process

2764
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:22,400
which the llc is prohibited from

2765
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:25,679
influencing by the charter we gave them

2766
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:29,040
the llc can't give advice to

2767
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,760
participants about how to participate in

2768
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:35,520
the ietf processes we wrote it very

2769
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:38,159
carefully so that it can't for lots of

2770
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:39,520
reasons having nothing to do with

2771
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,119
antitrust

2772
01:44:41,119 --> 01:44:43,119
so while it would be nice to punt it to

2773
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:44,800
somebody else to say just give us some

2774
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,840
advice

2775
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:49,360
the llc actually explicitly should not

2776
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:52,719
and as far as i can tell must not

2777
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:55,600
and with that i'm done and i do i'm

2778
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:58,480
curious how the chairs how and when the

2779
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:00,239
chairs will figure out to dispatch but i

2780
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:03,839
don't expect an answer today

2781
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:06,880
thank you joel it's very generous of you

2782
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:10,080
um so i think i mean i've posted in java

2783
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:11,920
and got some kind of discussion but i do

2784
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:14,320
think that a bit of a clarification

2785
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:16,239
and splitting of the problem space would

2786
01:45:16,239 --> 01:45:18,080
help um

2787
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:21,040
with kind of firstly protecting the itf

2788
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:23,360
and then secondly giving guidance more

2789
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:25,360
towards participants if that's something

2790
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:28,480
or educating participants a bit more um

2791
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,880
those two forks i am at least hearing

2792
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,320
from the community there's a lot of

2793
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:35,840
engagement and people are um yes as mark

2794
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:38,159
said i just clarified not advice but

2795
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:39,679
guidelines or education or something

2796
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:40,880
like that

2797
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,040
um i think there is a lot of support and

2798
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,639
interest in doing this the only

2799
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:46,800
negatives i heard against doing this

2800
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,400
work was whether a useful discussion

2801
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:49,280
would be

2802
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,199
possible and also it may be opening a

2803
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:52,880
can of worms but other than that i

2804
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:54,719
didn't hear anyone say that we shouldn't

2805
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:56,480
take this work forward so you can say

2806
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,880
that that is a one outcome

2807
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:00,159
um

2808
01:46:00,159 --> 01:46:01,840
i don't know if there's anyone who we

2809
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:03,520
just have sort of five minutes before we

2810
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:05,520
go to the chair's conclusion i may have

2811
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:07,840
closed the queue a little prematurely

2812
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,199
if um

2813
01:46:09,199 --> 01:46:11,119
anyone maybe

2814
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:15,040
is the ad or um anyone from kind of

2815
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:16,880
uh like i can see we've got mirror in

2816
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,560
the room would like to come forward and

2817
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:19,360
just

2818
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:22,000
sort of give the toughens j j daily go

2819
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,159
for it

2820
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,920
so uh jay daddy itf executive director

2821
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:32,800
um this um spreading the problem space

2822
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,560
to me is um

2823
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:35,520
uh

2824
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:37,600
a bit of a fallacy i don't think it is

2825
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,600
problem possible to sprit split the

2826
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:40,880
problem

2827
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:41,920
space

2828
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:44,000
there's very little of the llc can do

2829
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,800
itself or the org can do itself

2830
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:50,239
that incurs a risk to it

2831
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:52,560
all of the risk comes from

2832
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:55,119
the behavior of the participants

2833
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:58,480
so we can't have something that says um

2834
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:00,239
this is how we protect the organization

2835
01:47:00,239 --> 01:47:02,159
without getting into detail about the

2836
01:47:02,159 --> 01:47:03,600
participants

2837
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:05,360
and as joel says that's something that

2838
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:07,280
the llc can't do

2839
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:09,600
and and even then

2840
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,920
even assume the lrc could do it you

2841
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:15,360
can't split it in that type of way so um

2842
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:17,040
i have to disagree quite strongly with

2843
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:18,719
the idea that that's the way we go away

2844
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:20,960
and do it i think that's um a hopeless

2845
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,840
task

2846
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:32,480
so um

2847
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:34,800
yes as joel said

2848
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:38,159
it may not be possible to get a kind of

2849
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:40,400
consensus from what we've heard today

2850
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,480
i think there's been a lot of different

2851
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:44,159
options explored

2852
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:45,520
i'm not hearing

2853
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:46,320
um

2854
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,960
a strong support for any direction

2855
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:50,800
really um

2856
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:52,239
but i am definitely hearing from the

2857
01:47:52,239 --> 01:47:54,239
community that the work is important and

2858
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:56,480
that it needs to move forward in some

2859
01:47:56,480 --> 01:48:00,239
form so i would suggest considering

2860
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:01,600
all of that

2861
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,199
oh sorry lars you've just joined the

2862
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:05,119
queue please go for it

2863
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:06,639
yeah sorry i didn't want to interrupt

2864
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:09,600
you but so i i personally would like us

2865
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,880
to do

2866
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,560
something minimal here

2867
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,320
um that basically protects the

2868
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:17,360
organization and if we manage to

2869
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:19,440
do so in a way that gives useful

2870
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:20,880
information to our participants that's

2871
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,800
even better but i

2872
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:25,119
um i'm very nervous about for example

2873
01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:27,280
starting a working group in this space

2874
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:29,280
because i can see this

2875
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:30,639
you know quickly

2876
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:34,719
getting out of hand um and sort of i

2877
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:36,800
when i talked to brad and to joel what

2878
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:38,560
they had outlined they wanted to do

2879
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:40,159
seemed pretty

2880
01:48:40,159 --> 01:48:43,040
minimal imaginable to me so so in the

2881
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:45,679
continuing discussion and i suggest we

2882
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:47,840
use the gen dispatch list for lack of a

2883
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:50,159
better venue um

2884
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:52,800
i would sort of try and see if we can

2885
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:55,040
find something that is that is

2886
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:58,080
minimal and acceptable to participants

2887
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,080
and and if something minimal isn't

2888
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:02,880
acceptable then please explain why

2889
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:06,400
um it in your in your contribution to

2890
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:07,760
the discussion

2891
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:10,159
and i guess we will uh talk about this

2892
01:49:10,159 --> 01:49:11,520
more over the next coming weeks and

2893
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:15,320
months thank you

2894
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:18,719
thank you very much lars so

2895
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:20,400
i think um

2896
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,239
yeah the jabber chat continues that's

2897
01:49:22,239 --> 01:49:23,280
really good

2898
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:25,679
very happy to kind of like we said split

2899
01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:28,000
it and do something a bit smaller and a

2900
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,159
bit quicker um

2901
01:49:30,159 --> 01:49:31,599
and getting that off the ground

2902
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:33,760
initially and gender dispatch being a

2903
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:36,239
good venue for that discussion

2904
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:37,760
so we can probably

2905
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:39,920
at least leave that there

2906
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:41,040
and

2907
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:43,360
talk about um

2908
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:45,280
the other results from gen dispatch

2909
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:49,280
today and just recap that um anti-trust

2910
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:51,360
discussion as well at the end as part of

2911
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:54,159
that so um pete you're doing the kind of

2912
01:49:54,159 --> 01:49:56,560
outro wrap up

2913
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:59,840
um so over to you

2914
01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:03,679
oh dear

2915
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:05,119
been typing too much someone will have

2916
01:50:05,119 --> 01:50:07,599
to fill in the last bits of uh

2917
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:09,920
the minutes as i was taking them all

2918
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:13,199
right so let's um and actually um kirsty

2919
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:14,639
if you could put up

2920
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:17,920
the um the agenda slide so we can go

2921
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:19,840
through quickly

2922
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,599
and uh lars did you want to say

2923
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:23,040
something as we get into this you're

2924
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:24,480
still in the queue or was that from last

2925
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:26,718
time

2926
01:50:27,119 --> 01:50:29,199
ah good that was from last time

2927
01:50:29,199 --> 01:50:30,159
all right

2928
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:30,960
so

2929
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:34,320
it sounds like um

2930
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:35,920
the

2931
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,040
well

2932
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:40,639
we went and talked about each of them um

2933
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:42,560
rc series

2934
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,960
um responsibility change

2935
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:48,000
it sounds like our conclusion is

2936
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,760
that lars is just going to take it on as

2937
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:51,119
ad sponsored

2938
01:50:51,119 --> 01:50:54,239
and the same is true for 2028 this does

2939
01:50:54,239 --> 01:50:56,320
anybody want to

2940
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:58,159
jump up and say those are the wrong

2941
01:50:58,159 --> 01:51:00,000
outcomes

2942
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,440
obviously we're going to post this in

2943
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:03,360
the minutes to the list and make sure

2944
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:04,719
that no one goes screaming into the

2945
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:06,400
streets but

2946
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:08,239
i wanted to check on the two easy ones

2947
01:51:08,239 --> 01:51:09,599
or what i thought were the two easy ones

2948
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:11,760
first

2949
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:13,040
good

2950
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:14,320
um

2951
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:17,040
with regard to the term limits it sounds

2952
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:21,440
like at the very least we have to um

2953
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:22,800
have a

2954
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:25,040
uh

2955
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:28,639
someone volunteer to write up

2956
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:29,920
some of the

2957
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:33,840
current issues uh current brokenness in

2958
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:35,119
the

2959
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:37,840
uh nom-com document

2960
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:39,119
um

2961
01:51:39,119 --> 01:51:41,840
and then independently we should have

2962
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:44,639
above talking about how to

2963
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:48,400
dispatch that in effect and then

2964
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:50,080
talk about the

2965
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:52,000
term limits slash

2966
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:52,880
uh

2967
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:56,480
talent pipeline issues as a possible

2968
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:59,520
additional topic for that working group

2969
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:02,080
or for that potential work

2970
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,840
or whether that needs to be dealt with

2971
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:06,400
separately

2972
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:10,080
does that sound like where we're at

2973
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:12,400
trying to scroll and make sure that that

2974
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:16,040
was what was in the notes

2975
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:23,199
everybody comfortable with that

2976
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:26,800
and i'm hearing from

2977
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:29,760
the end of the topic on anti-trust

2978
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:31,360
guidelines

2979
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:33,760
that we still need to actually make a

2980
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:35,920
decision about how to

2981
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:38,159
um

2982
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:40,159
how to dispatch this

2983
01:52:40,159 --> 01:52:41,679
uh that

2984
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:44,800
possibility is that we do not do

2985
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:47,280
additional work on this

2986
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:49,440
but we have to figure out what we need

2987
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:52,159
to do in terms of policy if anything we

2988
01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:54,880
need to talk about what we need to do in

2989
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:56,960
terms of

2990
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:01,199
um education if anything

2991
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:04,560
pete sorry my reading was that there was

2992
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:07,199
a lot i only saw a couple of people

2993
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:09,119
showing support for doing nothing i

2994
01:53:09,119 --> 01:53:12,239
thought that yes i agree with that yeah

2995
01:53:12,239 --> 01:53:13,920
i think most people were in favor for

2996
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:15,520
doing something and it's just working

2997
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,080
out exactly what

2998
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,080
what kind of forms

2999
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:22,080
yeah

3000
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:23,119
so

3001
01:53:23,119 --> 01:53:25,280
i hear three things that we have a

3002
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:26,960
pretty good idea of how we're going

3003
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:28,560
forward with

3004
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:29,840
and

3005
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:32,960
uh the final bit on antitrust we're

3006
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:35,040
going to continue discussion on agenda

3007
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:36,880
establish that most people are in favor

3008
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:40,280
of doing something

3009
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:42,720
we've got uh

3010
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:44,320
[Music]

3011
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,719
okay that's an interesting question

3012
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:49,119
um

3013
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:53,280
and of course i'm trying to um

3014
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:56,239
keep my chair hat solidly on for this

3015
01:53:56,239 --> 01:53:58,960
part of the discussion

3016
01:53:58,960 --> 01:53:59,760
um

3017
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,199
we could start a show of hands for

3018
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:02,400
instance

3019
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:05,280
to just see the balance of

3020
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:08,960
yeah and actually a one question show of

3021
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:10,719
hands for

3022
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:13,119
people who think it's at least possible

3023
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:14,400
that we do

3024
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,760
nothing

3025
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:17,360
um

3026
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:20,560
would be very valuable information

3027
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:22,239
um

3028
01:54:22,239 --> 01:54:24,880
let me do that

3029
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:27,760
please raise hand

3030
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:30,000
if you think

3031
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,719
on the

3032
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:34,960
trust

3033
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:37,119
so perhaps maybe before you do that we

3034
01:54:37,119 --> 01:54:38,480
can just discuss it for a second before

3035
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:40,000
you hit send on that yeah go ahead go

3036
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,760
ahead colin while i'm writing him before

3037
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:44,800
i push start or anything like that

3038
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:45,920
i mean i

3039
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:48,719
i do nothing is sort of it's a phrase i

3040
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:50,639
think it's really a saying what we

3041
01:54:50,639 --> 01:54:53,280
currently have is reflective is adequate

3042
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:55,040
for our policy it's not do nothing it's

3043
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:56,880
stay with what we have right

3044
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:57,760
um

3045
01:54:57,760 --> 01:54:58,719
and

3046
01:54:58,719 --> 01:54:59,840
i i

3047
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:02,639
i guess i don't feel like people we have

3048
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:04,639
laid out for people a clear enough set

3049
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:06,320
of choices and options of what we could

3050
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:08,159
do and what we mean there's different

3051
01:55:08,159 --> 01:55:10,159
sort of goals of what we need to you

3052
01:55:10,159 --> 01:55:12,880
know protect an organization versus

3053
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:15,119
educate users i mean the way alyssa laid

3054
01:55:15,119 --> 01:55:16,639
this out really made a lot of sense to

3055
01:55:16,639 --> 01:55:17,360
me

3056
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:18,719
um

3057
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:19,920
i feel like

3058
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:21,520
i mean i'm fine for straw polls on

3059
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:23,280
anything but i i think that this is very

3060
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:25,599
much in this i don't

3061
01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:26,880
there's people that walked in with a

3062
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:28,400
very strong opinion of where they were

3063
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:29,520
standing when they walked into this

3064
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:30,719
meeting there's been a lot of discussion

3065
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:32,320
that's taken it all over the place and i

3066
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:33,920
don't think anyone's really laid out a

3067
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:35,599
great set of frameworks for us to make a

3068
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:37,119
good decision about an outcome at this

3069
01:55:37,119 --> 01:55:39,040
point so i don't i don't feel very

3070
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:41,360
strong i i feel like more work is needed

3071
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:43,280
before you can get a really crisp like

3072
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:44,960
here's what people should do and why

3073
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:46,400
you're you're sort of flailing at this

3074
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:47,840
point

3075
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,280
i i'm

3076
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:52,320
i i tend to lean toward you on this

3077
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:55,119
colin um

3078
01:55:56,159 --> 01:55:57,440
kirsty

3079
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:59,520
would you want additional information by

3080
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:02,000
show of hands

3081
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,760
um i just think

3082
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:06,080
yeah maybe while we have everyone here

3083
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:07,440
would be ashamed to waste the

3084
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:09,119
opportunity just to get a quick pulse

3085
01:56:09,119 --> 01:56:12,000
check even if that does change later

3086
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,719
on the list

3087
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:17,199
um so the important

3088
01:56:17,199 --> 01:56:19,760
top level bit seemed to me

3089
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:20,800
um

3090
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:21,920
that

3091
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:23,840
um

3092
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:25,280
richard was saying

3093
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:27,440
well there may be at least a good bunch

3094
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:28,960
of people who think that there's really

3095
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:32,000
not significant work to do here

3096
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:32,800
um

3097
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:35,040
so i'm thinking

3098
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:37,520
of asking the question please raise your

3099
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:39,840
hand if you think on the antitrust topic

3100
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:41,520
that it's at least possible that we

3101
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:42,560
really

3102
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:45,520
have no work here

3103
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:49,760
i would always opt for simplicity so

3104
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:50,800
maybe

3105
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:52,800
raise hand if you think there is no work

3106
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:54,639
to do here

3107
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:56,960
okay

3108
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:00,239
if that's clear enough so

3109
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:04,080
brad sorry do you want to speak

3110
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:05,360
yeah go ahead

3111
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:07,360
but just to comment i i just i'm a

3112
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:09,199
little worried about the the the movie

3113
01:57:09,199 --> 01:57:10,800
point was made in the chat that like do

3114
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:12,800
or actually the one made that uh

3115
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:13,760
uh

3116
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:16,560
the status quo we have a status quo um

3117
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:18,719
and the status quo is we have

3118
01:57:18,719 --> 01:57:20,400
we did that work

3119
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:22,800
nine plus years ago we

3120
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:25,360
have a statement from the llc

3121
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:28,080
we have a set of rules uh that are you

3122
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:30,080
know designed to minimize our anti-trust

3123
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:31,840
risks and so

3124
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:34,239
so the status quo is

3125
01:57:34,239 --> 01:57:36,639
is okay i mean it and and i think what

3126
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:38,560
like and i think it's a very important

3127
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:40,080
point for us to

3128
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:42,239
understand that there are any trust

3129
01:57:42,239 --> 01:57:44,159
risks in the world the ietf has a

3130
01:57:44,159 --> 01:57:46,560
strategy for managing those risks

3131
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:48,000
so so

3132
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
you know it's

3133
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:54,320
the status quo is an option um

3134
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:55,520
and so i and i just i'm a little

3135
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:57,840
concerned about framing this as

3136
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:00,320
you know no it's not nothing

3137
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:02,000
yeah yeah that that

3138
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,760
so you you would ask for the question to

3139
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:06,000
be more clearly stated as please raise

3140
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,679
your hand if you think the status quo is

3141
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:10,159
sufficient

3142
01:58:11,599 --> 01:58:13,520
yeah and it also strikes me that like

3143
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:15,760
what's

3144
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:17,599
i guess i'm not entirely getting what

3145
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:18,880
the point of the poll is like this is

3146
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:21,119
that's a very nuanced legal question

3147
01:58:21,119 --> 01:58:22,880
you're asking and but but i'll answer it

3148
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:25,440
for you the status quo is sufficient

3149
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:27,440
and and i don't know that it's useful to

3150
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:28,719
have

3151
01:58:28,719 --> 01:58:30,400
a bunch of non-lawyers well

3152
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:32,400
now understand brad

3153
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:35,040
understand uh you know what we're

3154
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:36,719
looking for here

3155
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:39,440
is whether this group thinks by way of

3156
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:40,800
dispatch

3157
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,000
that

3158
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,520
one of the possible outcomes is there's

3159
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:46,239
no additional work to be done

3160
01:58:46,239 --> 01:58:47,360
right

3161
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:50,480
you're you're suggesting that if that is

3162
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:53,679
the conclusion of the group in the end

3163
01:58:53,679 --> 01:58:54,480
that

3164
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:56,880
that's okay with you

3165
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:00,000
um that the status quo is sufficient

3166
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,119
but

3167
01:59:01,119 --> 01:59:02,800
you know if the rest of the group thinks

3168
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:04,880
there's additional stuff to be done and

3169
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:07,920
there's really no one who thinks

3170
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:09,280
uh that

3171
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,360
you know we shouldn't

3172
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:12,880
continue our work

3173
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:14,719
then we're gonna do some additional

3174
01:59:14,719 --> 01:59:16,880
either education work or talk to you

3175
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:19,440
about policy or whatever that might be

3176
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:21,679
right so this is not limiting the

3177
01:59:21,679 --> 01:59:23,199
discussion as much as trying to figure

3178
01:59:23,199 --> 01:59:24,400
out whether

3179
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:26,239
there are actual we need to continue the

3180
01:59:26,239 --> 01:59:28,320
discussion of is the status quo

3181
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:30,080
sufficient

3182
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:32,000
yeah and i think my point is just

3183
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,400
the status quo is an option uh i i think

3184
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:35,920
there potentially is useful work to be

3185
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:37,360
done so i'm definitely

3186
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:40,320
not arguing in favor of doing nothing um

3187
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:42,000
but i but i just don't i just want to

3188
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,199
make sure that

3189
01:59:43,199 --> 01:59:45,280
that we're clear that you know this is

3190
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:47,040
we've thought very carefully about our

3191
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:49,280
antitrust risks there's been a lot of

3192
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:51,920
analysis around it and you know i i'm as

3193
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:54,400
itf counsel i'm comfortable with our

3194
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:56,560
current strategy it's the kind of thing

3195
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:58,400
we can always iterate on always make

3196
01:59:58,400 --> 01:59:59,840
better from a legal point of view make

3197
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:01,520
better from you know what the community

3198
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:03,119
desires in terms of

3199
02:00:03,119 --> 02:00:04,880
education and guidelines and that sort

3200
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:06,960
of thing but i just i just just again

3201
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:08,239
just to emphasize don't want to send a

3202
02:00:08,239 --> 02:00:10,159
signal that that there's a problem with

3203
02:00:10,159 --> 02:00:12,000
the status quo because the status quo is

3204
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,280
okay

3205
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:14,480
right

3206
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:16,320
ecker you want to

3207
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:18,960
step in here

3208
02:00:19,370 --> 02:00:22,639
[Music]

3209
02:00:22,639 --> 02:00:24,320
uh first of all like i take whatever

3210
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:25,599
brad says in this type of very seriously

3211
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:26,960
this is his job to like know the answer

3212
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:29,920
this question um but um before i one

3213
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:31,520
thought we should do anything at all i

3214
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:32,719
would understand what the problem

3215
02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:34,080
statement was that we were attempting to

3216
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:35,520
address and i know i think i'm gonna

3217
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:37,520
have to discuss i don't understand like

3218
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:39,360
it's a problem statement that

3219
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:41,520
people at ietf

3220
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:42,719
might be well

3221
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:45,440
might be benefit from having uh uh

3222
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:46,880
um advice that they didn't that they

3223
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:48,000
could get from reading this that they

3224
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:48,960
couldn't get they couldn't get from

3225
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:49,920
council because they don't want to pay

3226
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:51,440
council or is it supposed to follow the

3227
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:52,480
people like for doing things they

3228
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:54,400
shouldn't be doing because they haven't

3229
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:55,679
been told to do them and this is like

3230
02:00:55,679 --> 02:00:58,080
really totally different and um so i

3231
02:00:58,080 --> 02:00:59,199
understand the problem statement is and

3232
02:00:59,199 --> 02:01:00,480
so i can handle the problem statement i

3233
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:02,239
really wouldn't want to like you know

3234
02:01:02,239 --> 02:01:06,440
uh decided to do something

3235
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:09,760
fair enough

3236
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:11,199
um

3237
02:01:11,199 --> 02:01:12,400
i am

3238
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:14,320
i am hearing at the very least even

3239
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:16,719
without asking the question

3240
02:01:16,719 --> 02:01:18,080
that

3241
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:20,719
uh discussion

3242
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:22,800
by way of

3243
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:25,280
is there more work to do is there more

3244
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:28,320
stuff that we want to take on

3245
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:31,440
that we could then dispatch some place

3246
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:33,040
is worth having

3247
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:34,159
um

3248
02:01:34,159 --> 02:01:35,679
because

3249
02:01:35,679 --> 02:01:37,040
as brad said

3250
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:38,800
you know the the current state of

3251
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:41,119
affairs the current status quo is that

3252
02:01:41,119 --> 02:01:42,400
there's a lot of

3253
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,719
stuff out there already maybe that is

3254
02:01:44,719 --> 02:01:46,320
going to be sufficient and we're going

3255
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:49,280
to come to consensus that there is no

3256
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:50,400
additional

3257
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:54,000
um work that we want to do in the ietf

3258
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,080
and dispatch it that way it sounds like

3259
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:57,440
there's a sufficient number of people

3260
02:01:57,440 --> 02:01:59,360
who say no no i really think there is

3261
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:00,880
work to be done

3262
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:02,800
but at least having that discussion

3263
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:05,920
initially seems like a good idea

3264
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:08,159
um

3265
02:02:08,719 --> 02:02:10,480
so i'm hearing we at least need a forum

3266
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:11,920
to discuss

3267
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:14,239
sort of the bounds here and what needs

3268
02:02:14,239 --> 02:02:16,800
to be done going forward

3269
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:19,840
does that seem fair

3270
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:25,840
i mean

3271
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:27,280
do you mean a forum

3272
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:28,159
like

3273
02:02:28,159 --> 02:02:31,440
oh hold on hold on i hear two voices

3274
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:33,839
um

3275
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:38,639
who is that speaking right now

3276
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:44,639
i think that's just you pete

3277
02:02:44,639 --> 02:02:46,320
no that's just me well there you go i

3278
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:48,000
have a strange uh

3279
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,719
uh thing going on in the background okay

3280
02:02:50,719 --> 02:02:53,679
uh i see it

3281
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:56,560
yes sir i haven't

3282
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:58,000
gathered speaking up in the background

3283
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,639
i've turned that off now um all right

3284
02:03:00,639 --> 02:03:02,400
sorry ecker go ahead uh

3285
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:04,480
if you wanted to

3286
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:06,400
that was very confusing

3287
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:08,560
out of the queue

3288
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:10,239
you're having the q okay

3289
02:03:10,239 --> 02:03:13,280
uh richard you wanted to say something

3290
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:15,040
yep

3291
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:17,199
um maybe i was only gonna say that we

3292
02:03:17,199 --> 02:03:18,960
are over time

3293
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:22,480
we are now over time all right um i'm

3294
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:25,920
hearing that for this last topic we do

3295
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:27,360
need further discussion we will have

3296
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:29,280
that discussion on the list

3297
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:30,480
um

3298
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:32,800
i would very much appreciate brad if you

3299
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:33,679
would

3300
02:03:33,679 --> 02:03:34,719
uh

3301
02:03:34,719 --> 02:03:37,280
summarize for the list where you think

3302
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:39,920
the appropriate ways that we could go

3303
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:42,400
and appropriate ways that um you would

3304
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:44,719
recommend we go are i think that would

3305
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:46,639
be good input to everybody

3306
02:03:46,639 --> 02:03:48,239
and uh

3307
02:03:48,239 --> 02:03:49,679
and we will continue the discussion

3308
02:03:49,679 --> 02:03:51,920
