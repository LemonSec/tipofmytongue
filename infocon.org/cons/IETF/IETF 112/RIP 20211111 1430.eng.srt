1
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,720
um it's better to be unmute um

2
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,080
i guess

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,480
it's time to start now so

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,640
um welcome to the daily

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,039
working group session

6
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,719
if you're not um

7
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,399
if you did not expect that topic to be

8
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,440
discussed

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,480
um you're probably in the wrong room

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,600
um we have the notewell i think you've

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,600
been um

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,680
pretty familiar with that

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,440
for now

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,760
um

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,480
we have also um some

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,239
a new policy that asks you to behave

17
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,000
properly

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,440
um so i don't think we we have had any

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,920
problem in the past but that's um

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,159
some something we have been asked to to

21
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,680
pay attention so

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,560
um

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,439
basically trying to i mean

24
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,320
try to be always professional

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,360
try to be impersonal as much as possible

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,400
um

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,840
but um hopefully um this is

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,000
a which which we have always been

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,439
experimenting in that working group

30
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,240
so

31
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,479
um

32
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,840
we have a minute taker

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,520
i guess

34
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,200
just checking if the minute taker is

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,399
here let's do

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,320
great um thank you for

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,399
doing that

38
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,479
for those that want to to have a look at

39
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,479
the meeting material

40
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,880
um we have also the chat um

41
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,680
yeah it's always hard to manage chat and

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,960
queue

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,000
but i will do my best and um my co-chair

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,599
is going to help me in in doing so

45
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,520
so we have a pretty tough agenda

46
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,319
first point is the architecture then the

47
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,080
implementation and then we will dive

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,520
into the solution space

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,720
and try to to to

50
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
don't go beyond the time slot we

51
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,400
allocated you

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,800
um so where where we are with the

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,400
documents so we have the requirements

54
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,319
that is um

55
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,160
in the editor queue

56
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,920
so um

57
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,160
um i don't know if um

58
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,760
our ad has a

59
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,040
any

60
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
any

61
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,760
expected the dates uh for uh publication

62
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,920
but hopefully it might be uh by the end

63
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,879
of the year

64
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,319
um

65
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,720
say something and and you can also uh

66
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,720
add any anything you want to say

67
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,440
no i i don't mean end of the year

68
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,680
we need to be lucky though

69
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,000
january is most probably

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,680
more

71
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,000
better

72
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,800
anyway

73
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,480
it's it's not in our plate now

74
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,239
um we do have a document i wish is gonna

75
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,519
be

76
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,280
um

77
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,200
um

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,280
is going to be um

79
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,319
in the rfcq by the end of the year

80
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:36,770
um

81
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,920
[Music]

82
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,480
um so this is a i think now we are

83
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,040
version 17. so um we had

84
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,920
lately some tough activity on that

85
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,799
um

86
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,159
to me

87
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,840
it's really the one i would like to

88
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
stress the people to get focused so we

89
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,280
can finally ship that one

90
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,319
um and then we have um

91
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,760
um so some um other documents uh that

92
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,000
are more related in the solution space

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,680
um i think we will probably need um

94
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,480
some discussion with cfrg i have for

95
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,000
those that attended cfrg uh this morning

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,399
um we received um

97
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,120
very good um feedbacks from at least the

98
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,000
question

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,960
we were asking doesn't mean we have

100
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,440
responses um so um

101
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,120
i mean it might take a little bit time

102
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,160
but as long as we get committed with a

103
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,919
cfrg um i see that as a good point

104
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,440
but bob is going to tell us much more

105
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,120
about this um

106
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,840
so yeah that's the solutions draft

107
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,800
and we're back to the agenda

108
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,840
so

109
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,080
i'm removing the chat windows that

110
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,650
prevents me to click on there

111
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,400
[Music]

112
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,960
and i think we can start so you know how

113
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,360
to i mean the first presenter is the

114
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,960
architecture so shuai

115
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,639
i think you know how to

116
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,479
do do you want to present or do you want

117
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,919
me to to present for you

118
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,360
uh you can present uh or i can quickly

119
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
go through for a minute uh we don't

120
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,440
wanna waste that time

121
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,479
okay so i mean

122
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,639
okay so um i can't share those so for

123
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,160
those that don't know

124
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,199
um

125
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,080
you

126
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,360
you have to

127
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,039
you you use

128
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,440
um i can stop the slideshare you can

129
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,720
request

130
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,680
sharing the slides

131
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,639
yeah i i requested

132
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,720
okay what's happening

133
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,360
so i i think i have to so i'm stopping

134
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,000
sharing the slides and i'm giving you

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,560
the screen

136
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,400
do i really want to share yes

137
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,000
okay

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,039
oh my god what's happening

139
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,639
is that good

140
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,000
i don't know

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,800
yeah that's good

142
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,520
so for those uh the other ones um that

143
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,199
will present later

144
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,840
um you have an icon which looks like a

145
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,080
document so when you request

146
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,240
you will be able to request a specific

147
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,319
presentation which might be um easier

148
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,560
okay i i don't know what you saw guys uh

149
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,919
i i saw like a mirror it's a million

150
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,000
minute mirrors

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,560
uh probably i just need to stop it maybe

152
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,639
you can press okay so i'm going to

153
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,280
present that

154
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,400
okay so

155
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,280
okay

156
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,000
so the architecture okay i'm sharing the

157
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,520
slides

158
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,840
yeah please

159
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,440
uh hopefully this is going to be our

160
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,280
last one

161
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,759
next slide please

162
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,919
so this is for the architecture uh we

163
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:10,960
had

164
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,319
16

165
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,680
and

166
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,919
that was a month ago before the meeting

167
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,120
uh

168
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,400
uh most comments uh or editorial and

169
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,479
accounting improvement

170
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,680
and

171
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,319
we have lots of them uh but it's 16

172
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,599
actually

173
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,800
trying to fix fix most of them um we had

174
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,880
a few of the

175
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,440
leftovers and also my mistake i have to

176
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,599
say that i phone called something

177
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,199
because the email coming from different

178
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,000
places i just easily forget but anyway

179
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,680
so 16 actually uh fixed most of the

180
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,280
comment uh release 17 we just had it on

181
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,080
uh yesterday uh which is uh was not this

182
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,280
slide

183
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,240
uh had more improvement

184
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,840
uh go to next slide please

185
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,280
uh just a little bit 2016 taxi

186
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,520
improvement i want to thank sue for very

187
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,360
detailed review so i have never done

188
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,080
this detailed in my life but thank you

189
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,280
so much

190
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,800
uh

191
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,919
and so mostly on the section four

192
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,759
uh reflects some of this specific

193
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,120
requirement i think that's one of the

194
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,960
comments from the rookie group

195
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,599
and also edited two new sections which

196
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,599
reflects on the

197
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,840
uh solutions piece we had on the trip

198
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
which is one of the trip authentication

199
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,000
and all the journal content

200
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,640
so that two sections already in 16 and

201
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,799
17 is also a little bit taxing

202
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,080
improvement

203
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,839
all right next slide please

204
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,519
uh this slide is not true anymore

205
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,440
because we have the 17 published

206
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,040
yesterday um

207
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,360
now we only have eight editorial notes

208
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,959
which is add edit uh a reminder

209
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,560
for the things

210
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,519
we

211
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,760
need to

212
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,120
finish

213
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,320
i think the first one is really

214
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,880
the architecture

215
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,480
figure i believe stu i want to discuss a

216
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,560
little bit um so i just want to say

217
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,720
personally i have no issues to

218
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,040
uh update all the favors but it just the

219
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,640
comments we get from the past two

220
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,440
meetings really uh in the flux so i need

221
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,680
to want to make sure we actually grade

222
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,519
to improve that figure to a more

223
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,120
complicated figure

224
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,920
um so once we great and hopefully still

225
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,839
can provide a little text on that

226
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,839
because it doesn't have a new component

227
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,600
on this new figure uh the second thing

228
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,920
um even though is everything is in the

229
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,279
editorial but the second thing is uh

230
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,600
i remember is the uh

231
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,839
30 pp update

232
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,920
which is i forgot to put it on thanks

233
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,680
man for the reminding

234
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,800
uh that will be on the final fix

235
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,160
uh then on the

236
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,640
uh i think what's the other stuff

237
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,079
yes the rest is a

238
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,720
editorial and a text

239
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,120
will be reviewed by uh

240
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,279
the rest of the co-authors

241
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,959
um yes

242
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,760
next slide please

243
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,760
so proposal the uh

244
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,079
to write the publication algorithm with

245
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,000
the co-author and chairs

246
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,399
um so we're gonna have a final revenue

247
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,399
in two weeks

248
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,279
i i suspect i hope we're gonna finish in

249
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,399
one week but

250
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,079
let's put it two weeks and then another

251
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,920
two videos for the second of the people

252
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,120
last call

253
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,040
um then i think we should be ready to go

254
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,320
uh

255
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,720
yes that's eight i think so this will be

256
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,200
the last one

257
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,240
so

258
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
yeah thank you schwein

259
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,000
so to me what is important is that we

260
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,680
stick to that uh

261
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,240
schedule which is in two weeks

262
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,920
um

263
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,519
i'm not especially talking to you

264
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,040
schwein um

265
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,440
uh but i mean uh for the for the others

266
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,440
to to come and to review

267
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,920
please be very reactive these two next

268
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,240
weeks so that um

269
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,839
this document can be shipped uh um

270
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,399
finally

271
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,200
um

272
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,720
if you have to say anything i mean um i

273
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,600
mean we are very few people so um i

274
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,920
suggest that you don't uh

275
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,440
ask for the queue you can simply um

276
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,720
speaker

277
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,000
um

278
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,320
yeah and take the money actually

279
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,200
okay just one thing i want to just uh i

280
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,519
actually want to students speak up a

281
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,839
little bit regarding the figure thing uh

282
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,800
uh we need a consensus with the group

283
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,519
but we are okay uh then

284
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,959
that's only one of the bigger things

285
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,010
that i had in my mind

286
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,240
[Music]

287
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,680
regarding the figure for the

288
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,600
architecture figure i think stu has a

289
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,920
really good a nice picture but we

290
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,440
haven't agreed we want to put on the

291
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,720
architecture

292
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,560
draft yet

293
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,200
okay so one comment i have for the

294
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,760
co-authors um because a lot of

295
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,279
discussions are

296
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,560
um

297
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,360
are between the co-authors

298
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,720
and uh

299
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,120
chairs and uh are usually copied and

300
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,519
probably uh not all other people

301
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,600
but um i would recommend you to all to

302
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,680
to have those discussions happening on

303
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,600
the mailing list so that everyone can

304
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,399
see

305
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,560
um the document is active at least some

306
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
people are exchanging on that and it's

307
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,240
not um

308
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,480
something that is uh being discussed in

309
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,959
the back exchange or behind the behind

310
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,920
the door and um imposed to the working

311
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,040
group so

312
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,519
i i would say that the the way the

313
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,639
document is um being discussed is um

314
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,760
very nice

315
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,360
very good um i think for um transparency

316
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,519
it might be better to to bring that to

317
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,360
the mailing is so that's um the only

318
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,240
thing i can add

319
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,279

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,959
yep let me uh

346
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,079
grab the

347
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,040
window and drag it over there

348
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,399
and i have no control on it

349
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,079
okay uh

350
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,079
everyone

351
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,360
everybody seeing that

352
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,160
yeah

353
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,399
yeah okay let me scroll down just a

354
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,680
little bit so you can see that the

355
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,600
bottom two lines

356
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,120
it's standard ascii art um adam did it

357
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,800
several months ago

358
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,959
we proposed it for inclusion in

359
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,240
requirements

360
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,199
um

361
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,920
it was determined uh that it was too

362
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,519
complex and didn't belong in

363
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,639
requirements

364
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,560
but that my understanding of the

365
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,040
comments was that it

366
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,680
did belong in architecture schweiz

367
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,120
understanding of the comments was that

368
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
no it was just plain too complex and

369
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
confusing period and didn't belong

370
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,839
in either the documents um

371
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,760
so i has mentioned that i'm introducing

372
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,399
two new entities here the gpod and the

373
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,680
psod i'm not introducing new entities at

374
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
all the the note at the bottom of the

375
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,480
figure explains them if i put the words

376
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,519
general public observer device in that

377
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,560
little box

378
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,959
and public safety observer device in

379
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,880
that little box then this figure is just

380
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,399
going to explode

381
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,399
uh in in size

382
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,959
um so these are merely

383
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,600
you know this this is a macro if you

384
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,639
will

385
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,360
to be expanded there and this is a macro

386
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,759
to be expanded there mentally by the

387
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,320
reader this is intended to show

388
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,160
the full picture because nowhere in

389
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,320
requirements or architecture do we have

390
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,639
the full picture of what's really going

391
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,440
on

392
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,079
in remote id that for instance a uas

393
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,839
consists of an unmanned aircraft and a

394
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,399
ground control system sometimes it must

395
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,160
be specifically the unmanned aircraft

396
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,480
that does the wireless communications

397
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,399
sometimes it can just as well be the

398
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,320
ground control station

399
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,720
um so anyway um this is the figure that

400
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,199
we are proposing to show the big picture

401
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,959
of all of the different relationships

402
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,800
except specifically

403
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,759
over-the-air one-way broadcast remote id

404
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,720
broadcasts which go to anybody in range

405
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,240
and would hopelessly complicate the

406
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,480
figure so that is the proposal and the

407
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,600
question is

408
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,639
do we want this in architecture or do we

409
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,199
not i will um

410
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,439
mu

411
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,440
so anyone wants to comment

412
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,880
i think it would would be nice to

413
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,079
include no good picture

414
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,000
second to agree that

415
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,599
the image is good to include an

416
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,679
architecture if anything

417
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,919
if there is no text in

418
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,000
where we place it in arch

419
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,400
about as stu mentioned

420
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,640
not including the broadcast lines

421
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,079
because it would hopelessly complicate

422
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,600
the picture that's the only thing that

423
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
should be end up in the text if it's not

424
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,039
there already but i believe it is

425
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,919
i believe that everything in this

426
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,280
picture is in architecture it's often

427
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,919
not too clear sometimes we say it could

428
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,520
be the ua or the g or the gcs

429
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,840
when we talk about you the uas doing

430
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,000
something and sometimes we talk about

431
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,840
that the server needs

432
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,720
authorization why we talk about

433
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,400
deserving authorization well that's

434
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,799
because it's typically a public safety

435
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,919
observer

436
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,880
so here in this draw picture we do

437
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,080
expand what's in the text

438
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,320
and maybe with this picture i can go

439
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,480
through the text and maybe point things

440
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,760
a little better

441
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,200
um in the text to this picture to relate

442
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,080
everything uh clear uh

443
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,840
soi has done a great job in getting the

444
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,080
text in there but i think this tech this

445
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,600
picture shows

446
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,960
the whole thing and that's all i have to

447
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,120
say

448
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,080
fantastic i think we had a consensus

449
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,440
from my point of view right now i think

450
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,320
everybody graded to have it

451
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,720
yeah i think there's also a kind of a

452
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
maybe more simplified version already in

453
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,440
the architecture draft in figure 4 right

454
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,360
so it seems like this just adds more

455
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,600
detail which seems like a good thing and

456
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,520
if there's no harm to add it like let's

457
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,918
just do it

458
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,080
yeah so i i yeah i think i've got the

459
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,320
point uh if there's any i mean let's see

460
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,840
if there's anybody objection that if

461
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,280
there's no objections that we can we can

462
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,600
just uh skip that and move to the next

463
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,760
one

464
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,480
i will point out um

465
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,840
there was a comment from matt in the

466
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,320
chat that he agrees it fits in the arch

467
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,080
we just need to make sure in the

468
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,240
narrative that some interfaces are not

469
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,200
in the drip scope and he gives daa and

470
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,880
v2p is an example

471
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,520
which i believe is already

472
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,440
i would just like to identify this as

473
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,160
the

474
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,520
context into which drip goes after this

475
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,080
is drip

476
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,600
okay so i i think we're pretty good i

477
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,400
mean

478
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,679
we

479
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,000
i haven't seen anyone opposing uh to to

480
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,400
have that figure in the draft

481
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
what i would like is that

482
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,240
the the the figure

483
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,480
with the dra with the text

484
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,000
being updated to to have that figure um

485
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,400
being included uh by the end of the week

486
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,600
does it sound like a plan

487
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,760
this end week for this figure uh i was i

488
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,600
was actually thinking uh

489
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,120
getting uh

490
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,240
18 revision uh as a whole to fix all the

491
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
editorial fix uh

492
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,400
we currently have we have we have like

493
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,679
eight of them

494
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,080
uh this figure can come together with

495
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,880
the rest picks and uh the only thing uh

496
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,120
i mentioned in the i think still mention

497
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,760
this well i think there's anything

498
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,280
there's something new from the figures

499
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,760
like dea everything uh

500
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,280
that wasn't my original concern which is

501
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,799
not in the drip architecture text at all

502
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,960
but uh i think stores clarify his he

503
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,320
will do something editorial to make sure

504
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,760
all the terms were

505
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,159
released to the architecture trip so

506
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,080
which is great

507
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,400
yeah it's also important to mention what

508
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,679
is not

509
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,200
in the scope of

510
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,640
the group so um

511
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,760
yeah

512
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,720
okay

513
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,880
okay good

514
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,919
thank you so next presentation

515
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,200
andre do you request the slides

516
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,200
yes

517
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,520
but i don't see you requesting uh

518
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:36,980
um

519
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,320
[Music]

520
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,840
for me it shows

521
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,480
i am in the queue for requesting

522
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,400
okay so okay i just granted access

523
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,640
yeah

524
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,600
okay that's you met granting access

525
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,199
okay so i need to pick up

526
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,000
okay there

527
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,159
okay so i'm going to give you okay it's

528
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,520
very last one okay

529
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,039
um

530
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,280
okay let's try again i pressed

531
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,320
slideshare request

532
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,159
okay just second i need to choose which

533
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,400
one

534
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,280
okay sure

535
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,080
you see now

536
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,000
yeah good

537
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,480
all right so i'm going to present our

538
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,039
forts to implement the drip architecture

539
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,440
with a blockchain called

540
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,640
per ledger euroham and let's work with a

541
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,120
couple of students plus maybe 10 more

542
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
who are participating in the code

543
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,600
development

544
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,520
okay so

545
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,880
so as you know we are making good

546
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,799
progress with requirements let's submit

547
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,360
submitted for publication

548
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,039
and still some parts are under

549
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,280
development for example the registers

550
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,320
how we should be keeping this drone data

551
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,799
and how to handle authentication and and

552
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,840
access to this data

553
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,799
so

554
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,080
in this

555
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,480
work we try to implement

556
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,640
registry as a

557
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,960
blockchain so that we can store

558
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,720
for example uh

559
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,919
drone drone id data and and and flight

560
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,360
record and so on in this chain and also

561
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,679
uh record like who requests something

562
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,120
from from this chain and the later focus

563
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,840
also network

564
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,120
remote id since our first priority is

565
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,600
broadcast

566
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,320
so these are the requirements that this

567
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,000
blockchain

568
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,840
should satisfy they are mentioned in

569
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,880
this

570
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,320
draft

571
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,159
requirements draft which is now

572
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,000
submitted for publication

573
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,320
so possibility to do public lookups

574
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,840
private lookups let's say from

575
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,919
authorized officers

576
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:02,560
and then

577
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,760
[Music]

578
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,440
provide authentication and the

579
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,360
provisioning of this

580
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,918
registry

581
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,039
so we did like a complete implementation

582
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,200
of a system including this drip

583
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,840
protocols

584
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,559
authentication uh formats and

585
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,440
also

586
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,159
the blockchain access and that try to do

587
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,159
some scalability measurements like i

588
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,240
will show some some simulations where we

589
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,799
have like let's say 100 drones operating

590
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,480
in in one area and there are some

591
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,760
requests

592
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,240
to the system just to see like how

593
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,400
scalable it is in practice

594
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,880
so about the

595
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,000
architecture of the system

596
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,960
so it's a quite similar picture to what

597
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,000
uh stu has showed so we have vedron who

598
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,919
broadcasts messages

599
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,720
an observer who can verify this uh

600
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,039
authenticity of his label and also

601
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,960
it stores them to this

602
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,600
iroha blockchain registry which can be

603
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,960
later acquired by authorized users or

604
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,600
public users

605
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,520
and

606
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,919
uh the drones directly not participate

607
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,400
in the in in the blockchain since we

608
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,159
assume that maybe we don't even have

609
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,320
internet connectivity we just

610
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,440
sort of broadcast using bluetooth or

611
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,400
wi-fi

612
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,799
messages

613
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,200
and this is the summary of the code that

614
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,320
we did so this um authentication part is

615
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,640
based on open hip implementation hip

616
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,039
version 2 crypto branch which was

617
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,720
extended to support things we specify

618
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,679
for for drip such as c shake

619
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,080
and hierarchical hits

620
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,240
so this part is public it's on bit

621
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,960
bucket so i think anybody can download

622
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,640
it right now

623
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,279
and the second part is some scripts that

624
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:02,000
we wrote for example to uh upload the

625
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,720
things to the to the blockchain and

626
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,840
like

627
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,760
verify

628
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,120
broadcasted

629
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,400
hits

630
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,480
so

631
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,320
this is

632
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
still private but we hope we can publish

633
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,159
it in the

634
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,559
end of the year

635
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,640
okay so this uh why

636
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,720
blockchain eroja because it has some

637
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,240
nice uh

638
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,760
properties like byzantine fault

639
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,600
tolerance so if there is some nodes

640
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,400
failing it's possible to

641
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,320
add

642
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,000
like more notes and

643
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,919
also it's possible to control who can

644
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,600
get access and

645
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,640
support public and private lookups

646
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,720
so this is the example of records that

647
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,320
we are putting uh to the blockchain

648
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,799
okay but the security analysis

649
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,880
well we think that it satisfies the

650
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,679
requirements stated for for the registry

651
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,039
because it

652
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,679
based on on permission access so that

653
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,240
like a new authorized user only can add

654
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,120
new

655
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,360
let's say drones to the system and also

656
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,159
it keeps track on who is accessing

657
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,159
what

658
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,320
and

659
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,679
it has some nice features like

660
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,919
multi-signature transactions and smart

661
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,840
contracts

662
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,279
so what does it give with

663
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,880
multi-signature transactions it's

664
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,200
possible that record is signed by

665
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,559
several entities

666
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,440
so if for example ground station

667
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,919
is compromised it's not enough to

668
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,399
compromise the whole system but also

669
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,240
need to compromise with drone for

670
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,240
example

671
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,399
using smart contracts it's kind of good

672
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,640
to know so it keeps track of who

673
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,880
actually accesses this data so for

674
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,120
example if some

675
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,559
officer

676
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,799
accessed it like outside of his duty or

677
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,320
something like that it could be later

678
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,360
tracked and verified

679
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,760
and in terms of performance evaluation

680
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,840
we

681
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,200
created it

682
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,240
like

683
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,840
using amazon virtual cloud so we were

684
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,640
running a

685
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,440
few euroca notes over there

686
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,120
and then the

687
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,360
few simulated drones for submitting its

688
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,240
uh

689
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,960
like broadcast id data to this system

690
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,000
and then

691
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,720
our users feel querying this information

692
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,440
so just to get the understanding of how

693
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,320
well it performs

694
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,840
okay so we had some simulations 500 or

695
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,799
200 drones like flying nearby which

696
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,640
should be like moving enough

697
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,880
for a small place

698
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,520
and uh in general the

699
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,760
performance was good so it was like 10

700
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,440
millisecond delay

701
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,360
from from the drones to the to the

702
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,678
system

703
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,440
and

704
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,200
this is the data which was transmitted

705
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,399
so coordinates altitude speed timestamp

706
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,440
and so on what is now required in

707
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,240
eu for regulations for drone id total

708
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,760
123 bytes but it can be also compressed

709
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,240
to as stsm

710
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,000
which is much shorter like 24 bytes

711
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,679
and obviously the more data you transmit

712
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,559
the more hungry it will be for

713
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,760
blockchain storage

714
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,760
and

715
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,399
this is the configuration that we looked

716
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,760
for for

717
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,520
used for eroja so it

718
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,679
adjusts the performance of his

719
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,159
blockchain

720
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,760
and here are some features so

721
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,080
like uh for example here is

722
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,440
16 blockchain notes and hundred drones

723
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,440
and we are sending some

724
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,399
updates and queries so you can see it's

725
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,000
pretty reasonable performance so few

726
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,480
hundred milliseconds max for

727
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,279
for these queries and also variability

728
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,080
presence but still like

729
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,639
moderate

730
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,960
and this is the size of

731
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,720
blockchain blocks which have been

732
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,399
committed

733
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,439
to a system

734
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,679
so that's basically it

735
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,600
so to summarize we have a code for

736
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,840
drip authentication part and for

737
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,960
also for blockchain storage part it's

738
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,360
currently over a bluetooth

739
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,120
four but we are extending to bluetooth

740
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,880
five and also

741
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,080
to wi-fi neighborhood awareness mode

742
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,200
which

743
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,120
maybe is now being replaced by something

744
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,600
else like bob mentioned

745
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,000
and yeah we hope to

746
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,080
have a complete prototype with flying

747
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,279
drone being tested end of year so if you

748
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,559
have any questions please

749
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,760
um

750
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,600
if i see no question

751
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,960
um

752
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,000
for the sake of time i'd like to switch

753
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,919
to the next um presentation

754
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,360
so why they donate the next presentation

755
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,480
the next presenters is taking control um

756
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,120
other please jump on and ask your

757
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,600
questions

758
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,080
so next presenter

759
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,080
i think that's uh bob

760
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,399
yeah

761
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,840
um

762
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,840
i think any questions while bob is

763
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,039
selecting his slides

764
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,919
uh-huh this works good

765
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,399
i think there's a this works the chat if

766
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,720
andre wants to answer and chat as bob

767
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,120
starts

768
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,840
okay so let me get going

769
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,240
here um

770
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,159
changes since uh the last ietf which was

771
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,760
version eight we're now on version 13.

772
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,840
uh so that

773
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,919
we have a name change we're now calling

774
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,120
these grip entity tags which ties in

775
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,760
nicely with what astm is calling things

776
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,240
we call these entity tags which is the

777
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,240
uaa name for hierarchical hits

778
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,760
so this is just

779
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,679
so when you see det

780
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,039
in this particular usage it is a

781
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,600
hierarchical hit but it's in the larger

782
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,480
framework of what we're naming uh in you

783
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,480
in uh uas which is the entity which is

784
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,559
uh the entity

785
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,279
i pulled all the proof messages from the

786
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,240
draft i'm going to rely and align with

787
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,600
drip off

788
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,240
and and no longer has specific message

789
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,159
formats here

790
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,559
amm and i've had a lot of going back and

791
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,200
forth as he'll cover in his in his off

792
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,880
version um you've uh you've really uh

793
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,480
plowed through together and come to

794
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,519
agreement on on that aspect

795
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,399
uh

796
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,640
i've aligned with the next version of

797
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,880
astm

798
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,440
f3411

799
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,960
uh removing us the version designation

800
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,640
and change requests

801
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,720
uh

802
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,320
uh the the the workgroup is bogged down

803
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,880
in some radio issues which is going to

804
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,200
force them to rebalance

805
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
we don't expect

806
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,559
to have any changes in our needs on this

807
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,120
but yogi bear did some to say something

808
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,480
about um you gotta you know it ain't all

809
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,480
over until it's over

810
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,560
but we don't expect those changes so

811
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,560
we're going forward as if our changes

812
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,679
are needed stay as is through the final

813
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,599
ballot

814
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,599
thus we take the year out because it

815
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,960
won't be robust in 21.

816
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,239
uh

817
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:31,359
i've completed the et mapping to uh

818
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,879
the cta 2063 a

819
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,800
this is for remote

820
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,280
id module it's a principal application

821
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,918
target and i have an example

822
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:42,800
and

823
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
for those of you who have not really

824
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,679
looked at the faa final rules faa

825
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,760
defines something they call a standalone

826
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,599
module that can be attached to a ua to

827
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,399
meet for backwards compatibility for

828
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,359
meeting the remote id requirements

829
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,960
and this these modules must send their

830
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,560
serial number

831
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,240
so what if that

832
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,920
module manufacturer

833
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,880
wants to use grip how can they do that

834
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,240
here's a way to map the hierarchical hit

835
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,000
into the uh the 2083 format so they can

836
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,119
comply

837
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,000
with the uh faa requirements and still

838
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,920
then take full advantage of everything

839
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,320
that we've done here that is the purpose

840
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,520
of this the principal purpose of this

841
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,880
section

842
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,079
um

843
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,520
the

844
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,680
privacy section dt privacy section has

845
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,839
been added or perhaps i should say the

846
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,599
lack of privacy because you are on open

847
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,680
broadcast media

848
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,400
i hope i i have done a good job of this

849
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,720
i've not gotten a review by anybody in

850
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,839
the ietf on this i've asked over in the

851
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:52,640
uh

852
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,000
the privacy

853
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,440
work research group no response yet from

854
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,839
them

855
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,400
and the security consideration section

856
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,000
has been expanded

857
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,160
uh particularly the second image attack

858
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,839
possible with modern

859
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,160
custom asics uh thank you for cfrg for

860
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,920
some response on this but working more

861
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,160
with cfrg to see if there's anything

862
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,640
else i need to have here

863
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,720
one thing that this indicates is how

864
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,000
important the registration process is

865
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,800
because there is a attack and this a

866
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,320
loss of trust

867
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,520
if we don't have the registration

868
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,800
so um adam and i will next be working on

869
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
the registry draft we're rolling up our

870
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,560
sleeves on that with everybody else who

871
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,800
with assistance on that that's why the

872
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,480
two of us want to finish

873
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,040
drip rid and drift off so we can focus

874
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,400
on drip registries

875
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,839
as i indicated i now strongly rely on

876
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,240
both drip off for the anticipation

877
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,200
proofs and i will be relying strongly on

878
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,720
drip registries as our mitigation for

879
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,520
attack against the uh

880
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,839
the size of our our hash

881
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,520
so in terms of work status there are two

882
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,200
known implementations of ax enterprise

883
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,720
adam thank you

884
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,760
and andre students thank you andre for

885
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,680
your work and we're looking for other

886
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,520
invitations of course that may be uh

887
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,760
out there or or

888
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,520
people are planning on doing

889
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,320
i feel now at this for this point i am

890
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,960
done except for fine tuning people may

891
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,240
take some issues with the dns examples

892
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,520
formats

893
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,880
those are

894
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,920
malleable you can if people want

895
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,920
different ones we can deal with that but

896
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,480
i think that this this document is now

897
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,680
complete

898
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,160
and it is ready for workgroup class call

899
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,200
i now open up questions

900
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,800
please go robin

901
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,920
robin yes

902
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,119
robin we cannot hear you

903
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,839
if you're speaking

904
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,240
so it's my time but i don't hear him

905
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,800
real i think real softly they barely

906
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,200
hear you run

907
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,079
well robin went away maybe he'll put it

908
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,200
on on the chat

909
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,760
anybody else wants to contribute or say

910
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,680
anything about

911
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,560
um

912
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,920
the uh remote our remote id work itself

913
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,079
uh i like this up to for the our chairs

914
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:26,800
to

915
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,280
make the work group last call

916
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,320
and get this moving along and get it off

917
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,280
the isg as soon as we can

918
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,920
i thank you for your time

919
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,240
thank you bob um i'll check that with my

920
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,680
co-chair

921
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,760
and

922
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,320
eventually

923
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,280
we will do that

924
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,240
have to check with med

925
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,680
so robin when you're back just uh ask

926
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,320
your question and um

927
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,400
in the meantime we're going

928
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,480
yeah

929
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,040
is the audio working now

930
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,960
yeah it is working

931
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,800
terrific sorry about that sudden audio

932
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,160
fail syndrome

933
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,440
um so

934
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,720
when bob was talking about the

935
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,640
importance of registration

936
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,400
for these um

937
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,839
for these endpoints

938
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,000
it just made me wonder whether whether

939
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,079
the rats working group has what you

940
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,280
would need

941
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,040
so you know the ability to make secure

942
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,440
remote attestations about

943
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,520
a particular device or an endpoint

944
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,960
there might at least be some design

945
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,800
patterns there that you could

946
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,090
that you could um

947
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:40,400
[Music]

948
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,319
capitalize on i was gonna i would not

949
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,599
gonna say i was trying not to say

950
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,200
plagiarize but you know reuse

951
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,240
well adam you've been uh following rats

952
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,480
yeah

953
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,599
rats um i definitely think that an

954
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,319
implementation using rats

955
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,680
is possible

956
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,440
um

957
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,920
i haven't thought that deeply into it

958
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,400
unfortunately which is probably not a

959
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,599
good thing

960
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,119
um but it's definitely open

961
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,960
to uh

962
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,920
be the way forward

963
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,160
yeah so

964
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,400
robin do you think that

965
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,720
um

966
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,240
we should active as a verifier or um

967
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,399
as an interested party in that case

968
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,560
yeah that's kind of where i kind of

969
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,880
stopped thinking about it because i

970
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,119
wasn't in a position ready to make that

971
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,160
call

972
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,400
um

973
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,760
because i didn't have quite a lot of the

974
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,480
architecture sorted out yet now i think

975
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,079
i am a little bit closer to that it's

976
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,520
good that you brought it back up um

977
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,040
could be

978
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,920
i mean

979
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,440
some of the some of the use cases for

980
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,040
rats are aimed at things like um

981
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,920
uh mobile devices or um

982
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,359
hardware two-factor authentication

983
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,040
tokens that kind of thing

984
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,000
where the entity manufacturing producing

985
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,280
and distributing

986
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,040
the the physical endpoint is not

987
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,440
necessarily the entity with whom the

988
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,359
user has the operational relationship

989
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,200
so in that sense i suppose there are

990
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,520
probably parallels with the

991
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,760
drone deployment case

992
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,640
because you'd want very close

993
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,680
collaboration between the manufacturer

994
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,480
and

995
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,800
the um

996
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,560
well so the hardware manufacturer the

997
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,040
avionics developers

998
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,319
and the

999
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,839
operational force actually using the

1000
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,280
device right so i mean

1001
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,359
rats might have some patterns but so the

1002
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,079
other thing that occurs to be just um

1003
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,880
off top of my head also is um there's a

1004
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,760
lot in suit that might be relevant too

1005
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,200
yes because these are essentially

1006
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,800
connected things

1007
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,720
yeah yeah yeah

1008
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,880
and apologies you you've probably been

1009
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,800
down this part already so i'm coming to

1010
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,040
it late sorry about that yeah no we've

1011
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,079
been looking more at reg extensions um

1012
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,760
for the registration um process

1013
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,119
uh that's where most of our uh attention

1014
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,400
has been and you and looking how epp

1015
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,200
could be uh leveraged for for that

1016
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,079
uh but definitely i'll i'll go back to

1017
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,240
uh look at rats again i was at the

1018
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,800
beginning of it but stepped away from it

1019
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,560
and maybe i can

1020
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,319
rattle hank's

1021
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,560
rat cage and get something from him on

1022
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,520
it

1023
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,560
right

1024
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,200
terrific great thanks bob

1025
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,400
still here

1026
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,760
i don't know if we'll be able to use

1027
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,160
actual rats formats or protocols given

1028
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,880
the need for extreme compactness over

1029
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,000
the air here but if we look at um you

1030
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,599
know their

1031
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,240
patterns those might be very instructive

1032
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,280
agreed i agree with that 100 percent

1033
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,920
uh i'm going to obviously

1034
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,280
for really constrained environments

1035
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,000
you've got ace as well

1036
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,480
okay i'm going to transition to my

1037
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,119
slides so because i have 15 minutes to

1038
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,240
go through all of this um so this is the

1039
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,560
authentication formats uh it was

1040
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,720
obviously there was a name change

1041
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,599
um so change in since 01 when it was

1042
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,920
adopted we've gotten a new title much

1043
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,640
like

1044
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,040
bob's draft i rearranged a lot of

1045
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,960
sections for some clarity

1046
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,240
uh i followed bob's example removed

1047
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,079
f3411-19

1048
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,560
explicit references and just use f 3411

1049
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,800
because the draft very much

1050
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,280
lines up with the uh

1051
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,440
in ballot or soon to be invalid f3411

1052
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,200
and then some high level overviews

1053
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,000
section 3.3 was updated i reordered some

1054
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,319
formats there was a new operational

1055
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,720
recommendations added and appendices got

1056
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,160
shifted all around

1057
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,560
so the section 3.3 rework at a high

1058
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,359
level uh it's still an overview of the

1059
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,160
current astm authentication message it

1060
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,160
was reworked massively to make it clear

1061
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,599
but remain abstract due to the licensing

1062
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,319
copyrights of the astm document because

1063
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,880
you have to pay for it we cannot just

1064
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,359
blindly copy paste in so i have to

1065
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,319
abstract away some stuff and abstract

1066
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,480
the not the concept but a lot of the

1067
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,599
fields um i'll go into more detail on

1068
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,280
the f34 v 1.1 specific changes that were

1069
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,240
made

1070
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,000
uh we have a new constraint section

1071
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,599
which i'll go into

1072
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,079
and f3411 v1.1 is revaliding as bob said

1073
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,839
later this year

1074
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,520
due to the process it will probably

1075
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,480
become f 34 11-22

1076
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,480
not dash 21 like everyone had hoped

1077
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,280
earlier this year

1078
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,400
um so specific f

1079
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,240
uh v 1

1080
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,640
1 changes uh first off there was the

1081
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,040
inclusion of a new authentication type

1082
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,599
called sam the specific authentication

1083
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:10,480
method

1084
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,160
and it's a means to add authentication

1085
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,440
formats after 3411 was published because

1086
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,440
of the process to publish the document

1087
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,480
if someone came with a new

1088
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,920
authentication method or type

1089
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,400
it would mean changing the standard

1090
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,520
pulling the working group together

1091
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,280
rebalancing sending it it would just

1092
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,920
take too long this is um

1093
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,839
now there's one

1094
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,000
authentication type and there's a byte

1095
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,680
at the very start of the authentication

1096
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,839
data taking away a byte that we could

1097
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:38,720
use

1098
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,480
that multiplexes and that bite has been

1099
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,079
decided by astm to be maintained by icao

1100
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,319
the international civil aviation

1101
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,680
organization

1102
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,680
and so the working group will need to

1103
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,640
submit a request for some values in this

1104
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,599
field

1105
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,400
they're going to follow very similar

1106
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,680
um

1107
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,000
field

1108
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,280
requests much like ayanna in fact

1109
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,920
kudos to bob bob was instrumental in

1110
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,880
helping the astm write some prose text

1111
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,280
basically taking some stuff from iets

1112
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,319
ayana considerations and retooling it

1113
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,280
for astm so that iko could take up a

1114
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,079
role

1115
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,720
somewhat similar to this

1116
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,720
the other addition change that was

1117
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,200
massive was the additional data length

1118
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,599
and additional data field these are more

1119
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,280
pseudo fields

1120
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,160
because we have now all 16 pages

1121
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,920
available to us on the authentication

1122
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,119
message

1123
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,280
but only a subset of them can be

1124
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,000
actually used over broadcast due to

1125
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
media constraints which i'll get into

1126
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,359
later

1127
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,920
um so this field is where we put our

1128
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,000
forward error correction and so the

1129
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,400
figure on the right you can see

1130
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,520
is excerpts from the draft as it is now

1131
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,440
so figure one is a page of

1132
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,800
authentication

1133
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,280
and figure two is the

1134
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,920
layout of the fields found across those

1135
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,040
pages

1136
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,400
and the

1137
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,640
last figure the very bottom figure is

1138
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,440
what happens when the sam code isn't

1139
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,960
placed into it because we're off type

1140
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,839
five

1141
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:15,839
so you can see where the fec would be

1142
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:20,000
and where all the data would be

1143
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,480
um so the forward error correction um

1144
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,760
because

1145
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,119
that was changed it used to be an

1146
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,440
appendix it was pulled up into the main

1147
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,680
draft it was retooled to use the

1148
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,839
additional data field

1149
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:34,400
um and i reworded a lot of the text to

1150
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,559
make it clear there was some redundancy

1151
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,960
in multiple places across the document

1152
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,440
so that redundancy was removed

1153
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,440
and it drove a bit better of a

1154
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,040
constraint

1155
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,119
okay thanks um ben um so fec was aligned

1156
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,599
we need to fec page align

1157
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,240
we need to do read solomon potentially

1158
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,079
with multi-page fec because now we can

1159
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,079
do it and there was some discussion

1160
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,440
between the authors about doing

1161
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,319
something with more than off

1162
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,160
the broadcast anticipation structure is

1163
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,800
another section it's brand new well kind

1164
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,960
of new but it's been modified it fits

1165
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,760
within the sam authentication data

1166
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,720
the signing timestamp was removed by me

1167
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,400
in the last revision

1168
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,839
there was some back and forth between

1169
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,640
the authors on if this is really what we

1170
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,920
want to do

1171
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,040
because it was kind of an ad hoc change

1172
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,359
it will either be re-added or stay

1173
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,000
removed importantly this structure is

1174
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
what gives us self-attestation of the

1175
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,359
det

1176
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,440
and it confirms possession of the key

1177
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,920
asserted by the broadcast attestation

1178
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,640
which is in the drip link message which

1179
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,559
is the um

1180
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,559
attestation that comes from the registry

1181
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:45,680
process

1182
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,240
there are lots of broadcast attestations

1183
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,559
um potentially do we send them all do we

1184
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,319
only send a subset of them

1185
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,480
a link type was added to multiplex

1186
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,920
against these

1187
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,800
because

1188
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,520
we

1189
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,319
aren't at the 200 byte limit so

1190
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,720
losing a byte but we're only four pages

1191
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,440
in

1192
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,440
is kind of whatever

1193
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,079
appendix b has an example of this

1194
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,640
uh the drip manifest got some reworking

1195
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,800
the hash lengths were changed

1196
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,800
we added some text to define how to hash

1197
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,160
messages

1198
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,400
and there was a variable window byte

1199
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,319
added which needs to get

1200
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,319
more well defined it was something from

1201
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,400
bob

1202
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,079
the big takeaway if you take anything

1203
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:27,760
away from as i speed through these

1204
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,520
slides is

1205
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,559
the drip link plus the manifest together

1206
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,040
gives us the trust we need because we

1207
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,760
take the drip blink which tells us

1208
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,520
what we do

1209
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,400
um

1210
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,960
tells us that the key can be trusted

1211
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,359
because of the registry and then the

1212
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:46,960
manifest because it's dynamically signed

1213
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,960
by the aircraft

1214
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,440
validates the ownership of that key that

1215
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,599
was asserted

1216
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,480
and there is some text on having to send

1217
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,079
the drip blank but also send some

1218
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,359
dynamic

1219
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,040
dynamic

1220
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,640
uh

1221
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,400
data

1222
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,079
the drip frame is another

1223
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,280
thing it's more for um future proofing

1224
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,880
so i won't go too much into it it might

1225
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,480
need a rename

1226
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,480
um there's a recommendations and

1227
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,160
requirements section that has all the

1228
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,760
recommendations and requirements for

1229
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,160
drip to be run this is

1230
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,280
where again we get the assertions

1231
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,640
and the recommendations to send the

1232
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,480
other link messages

1233
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,640
um operational recommendations needs to

1234
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,800
get reviewed

1235
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,280
and dependencies got moved all over the

1236
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,680
stuff over the place

1237
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,680
this is a new appendice that i need to

1238
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,520
make and fix them

1239
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,839
and finally the to-do's um

1240
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,280
bob has some things he wants to look

1241
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,760
into fec needs to be cleaned up and

1242
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,280
fixed the

1243
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,640
manifest window operational

1244
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,240
recommendations needs to be reviewed and

1245
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,640
possibly expanded i might need a nike

1246
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,960
and considerations now i need to do

1247
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,359
appendix a appendix b

1248
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,000
uh but it wants a flow diagram

1249
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,800
and for next steps i'm going to get a v4

1250
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,720
with these pending issues done

1251
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,280
i'm going to hopefully get an iot sector

1252
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,200
early review given

1253
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,760
and then do another release

1254
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,400
earlier next year and then we will

1255
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,520
hopefully have a working class call

1256
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,559
um

1257
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,880
that's that because i'm next i'm going

1258
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,960
to immediately jump into the next set of

1259
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,640
slides um if i can change my deck which

1260
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,680
i will

1261
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,520
so i'm going to immediately jump into

1262
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,040
registries

1263
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,880
which we kind of started going down that

1264
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,240
rabbit hole

1265
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,759
so since zero zero

1266
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,760
uh bob i don't have time for questions

1267
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,440
yeah i gotta keep going i gotta keep

1268
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,319
going

1269
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,760
so

1270
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,760
four four registries if you have

1271
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,559
questions

1272
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,119
send it to the list please um so for

1273
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,400
registries since zero zero it expired i

1274
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,680
fixed it

1275
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,160
um i brought it back up it expanded from

1276
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,960
11 to 36 pages the attestations that

1277
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,960
were in auth are now in registries so

1278
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,720
bob might actually have to change saying

1279
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,480
he's looking at auth instead look at

1280
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,599
registries

1281
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,440
and then i started doing some stuff

1282
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,760
overall this is a mess because this is

1283
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,880
literally all my notes all my thoughts

1284
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,800
bob's thoughts stu's thoughts all thrown

1285
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,960
into the draft and trying to give some

1286
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,400
order so

1287
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,200
it's a nightmare please

1288
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,880
try to

1289
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,839
um

1290
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,400
rock it as best as you can

1291
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,920
some texts were borrowed from drift

1292
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,640
drafts uh other drip drafts the

1293
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,480
definitions claims assertions

1294
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,280
attestations and certificates section

1295
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,520
is in three places now i don't like

1296
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,119
things being in three places we should

1297
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,640
probably select where it lives forever

1298
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,280
it's most in line with arch

1299
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,000
um and section four was from appendix b

1300
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,240
of off it was reorganized set into

1301
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,400
subsections and has a new section 4.1

1302
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,119
this is section 4.1 on the left and on

1303
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,480
the right is a document to show the

1304
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,079
relationship between all the different

1305
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,160
attestation and certificate formats that

1306
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,559
are defined in the document

1307
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:11,839
i will be putting this diagram into

1308
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:13,680
[Music]

1309
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,720
the

1310
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,280
draft once i figure out the svg stuff

1311
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,559
that

1312
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,520
was commented on in the chat

1313
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,839
the registry classes and entities this

1314
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:24,640
is

1315
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,160
attempting to make a set of terms to

1316
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,520
talk about registries easier potentially

1317
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,520
um so there were and define some special

1318
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,880
registries that exist in the ecosystem

1319
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,000
so this is the um generalized high level

1320
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,200
view of all of the registries that exist

1321
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,960
the route the irm the mra

1322
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,559
caas or just ras in general and remote

1323
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,640
id registries which would most likely be

1324
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,520
uh

1325
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,720
uss's utm service suppliers and we can

1326
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,640
see the interactions that are required

1327
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,480
from the unmanned aircraft or uas system

1328
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,400
to given registries and from the

1329
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,079
observer

1330
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,640
and how it relates to broadcast grid

1331
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,760
um the fqdn definitions are now here as

1332
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,640
well

1333
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,559
um they need to be harmonized with the

1334
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,720
uas or drip grid

1335
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,400
there are some open questions that we

1336
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,799
have to sort out and that will go to the

1337
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,559
list

1338
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,720
the dns records i have a list of the dns

1339
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,720
records i propose that we will probably

1340
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,960
be using and the justification for their

1341
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,880
use and some specific ns records that

1342
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,440
are needed that i found as i began my

1343
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,280
implementation

1344
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,960
and then there's a whole section about

1345
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,200
registry operations it's basically

1346
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,440
section 9 trying to become technical

1347
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,960
instead of pros

1348
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,040
it's a mess

1349
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,640
please make it human readable because

1350
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,400
it's only adam readable right now

1351
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,040
um so implementation finally we finally

1352
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,559
have something for registry

1353
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,599
implementation at ax enterprise um it's

1354
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:01,680
deployed on a development coupe cluster

1355
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,160
so it's not available publicly

1356
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,599
um it's a rough http api to register all

1357
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,599
the different entities that i mentioned

1358
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:10,799
before

1359
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:14,160
it manually updated dns zones but

1360
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,520
it took like four months because of a

1361
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,640
lot of other things that were happening

1362
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,440
but the good news was in the past two

1363
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,200
months we've been transitioning and

1364
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,920
doing stuff with epp and rdap much like

1365
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,760
the architecture said we probably should

1366
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,799
be doing

1367
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,280
so we have been working on that i have

1368
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,280
some xml tag definitions that probably

1369
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,040
have to be into the draft for iana

1370
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,640
considerations

1371
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,640
and rdap is starting very soon

1372
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,960
so next steps on registries i have to

1373
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,599
refine section 4. section 8 needs a lot

1374
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,839
of help because it's just

1375
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:48,799
a

1376
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:51,359
just a wall of text that is badly

1377
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:52,640
organized

1378
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,839
we need to clean up and refine the

1379
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:55,680
revisioning process which kind of aligns

1380
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,040
with section 8.

1381
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,119
it's very us centric so we might want

1382
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,960
some eu inputs

1383
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,520
we need to do epp rdap stuff

1384
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,839
and then we need pii protection to

1385
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,200
protect the serial number and other

1386
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,000
things so my plan is to work with bob

1387
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,640
extensively to do the x 509 stuff that

1388
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,040
he i think has in the pipeline

1389
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,160
and

1390
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,720
this draft is very important as it

1391
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,400
supports not only dash off and is

1392
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,920
referenced by uas rid it also supports

1393
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,319
operator privacy potentially another

1394
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,839
draft by bob

1395
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:31,680
so the question is when do we want to

1396
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,359
adopt this document it's gone in and out

1397
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:37,440
it was said for many months that we'd do

1398
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,440
it it never got released and it finally

1399
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,240
got a dash 0-0 which then immediately

1400
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,160
expired

1401
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,640
so do we want to adopt this soon so it

1402
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,559
falls into the working group so that it

1403
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:50,160
actually gets the love and attention

1404
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,960
that it deserves

1405
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:55,839
and i think i just blazed through that

1406
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,000
faster than i wanted to

1407
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,960
and

1408
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,040
hopefully stu got as many things as he

1409
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,160
could

1410
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,119
um

1411
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,520
so any questions or comments if we have

1412
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,119
any but i see we have like two minutes

1413
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,079
left for the session in general

1414
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,880
um and just for reference

1415
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,359
on this image cartoon stu is the one

1416
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:16,960
sitting at the desk and i'm the one with

1417
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,960
the hat on looking at him

1418
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,960
questionably

1419
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,400
i'm done

1420
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,480
okay so any

1421
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,440
one question maybe

1422
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,760
sure one comment

1423
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,079
[Music]

1424
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,559
who wants to fire

1425
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,240
so i check with michael kocher and we'll

1426
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,680
start the call for adoption very soon

1427
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,720
um

1428
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,520
and i um

1429
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:56,160
if there are no other questions um

1430
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,760
um if med wants to add something please

1431
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,760
uh

1432
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,920
i have one item to report daniel

1433
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:13,359
it goes to yeah

1434
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:15,200
yeah i just wanted to let everyone know

1435
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,640
that uh observer to pilot communications

1436
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,160
which is something we have talked about

1437
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,200
a little

1438
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,119
from the first but there's been a lot of

1439
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:24,880
concern about whether that's really a

1440
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,480
good idea or not

1441
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,720
there was a recent

1442
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,760
meeting in the u.s involving

1443
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,480
many federal agencies

1444
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,119
and it emerged from that meeting that

1445
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:38,319
there is now

1446
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:40,720
um a wide recognition across those

1447
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,720
agencies of the need

1448
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,559
for indeed as we've hearing drip have

1449
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,559
said from the first read information to

1450
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,880
be immediately actionable and since you

1451
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,480
don't want that action always to be

1452
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,079
taking down someone's aircraft that is

1453
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,599
straight into an area where it probably

1454
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:54,640
shouldn't be

1455
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,319
it would be really great if we could

1456
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:58,880
immediately establish communications

1457
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,960
between the observer and the pilot but

1458
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,160
they have

1459
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,520
indicated that there's a requirement

1460
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,880
there that those be private

1461
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,960
communications when the observer wants

1462
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,960
to talk to a pilot doesn't want just

1463
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,119
anybody who is eavesdropping on rid to

1464
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:14,880
also be able to eavesdrop on those

1465
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,200
communications

1466
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,559
yeah so

1467
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,119
my perspective is that it's um

1468
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,559
um

1469
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:25,680
it's something that is happening

1470
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,920
from the information we gather from uh

1471
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,400
from the registry so i would see that as

1472
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:30,660
a

1473
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:31,760
[Music]

1474
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,240
a second step once we we have all the

1475
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,480
draft that we've presented and talked so

1476
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,440
far

1477
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,680
uh about that are

1478
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,599
rfcs

1479
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,680
or in the rfc d2q no

1480
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,040
work in this area right now i just

1481
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,319
wanted to let everybody know that it's

1482
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,799
on the horizon okay
