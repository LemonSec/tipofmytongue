26
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,680
it's an early morning california

27
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,800
so

28
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,519
welcome to atf 112

29
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,879
vegan virtual and please not well by

30
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,120
participating in a tf you agree to

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,760
follow idea process and policies

32
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,040
specifically would also like you to

33
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,000
ask to be

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,799
polite and treat your fellow idea first

35
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,200
with respect and be number of

36
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,000
events where it wasn't so luckily not in

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,680
our working group but we would like to

38
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,599
emphasize the point

39
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,080
that it's a no harassment environment it

40
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,280
would like you to

41
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,239
to act accordingly

42
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,920
working group status

43
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,000
lift base pack has been waiting for

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,319
eddie review alvarez here we had a

45
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,239
meeting couple of days ago

46
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,480
and alvaro promised to do it by the end

47
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,920
of the year which is pretty close

48
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,200
applicability statement almost ready

49
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,880
we got

50
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,680
good reviews

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,320
we finally also got all the apr

52
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,600
statements here

53
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
uh in the limitless alvaro this will be

54
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,080
handled together with the base pack so

55
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,479
when it goes through ifg review they

56
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,479
could actually cross on both documents

57
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,400
young draft

58
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,320
had addressed

59
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,880
jeffrey were saying

60
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,320
okay young model has addressed uh

61
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,680
comments received from young doctors and

62
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,000
from shares perspective is ready for

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,840
working with lascal which will start

64
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,160
soon kv registry you would like to ask

65
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,280
the authors what they think with regards

66
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,360
to upcoming changes if anything needs to

67
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,639
be changed and when do they think to be

68
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,360
ready for working with plus call

69
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,600
out evp and draft is in progress there's

70
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,280
really good progress i think the results

71
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,840
are planning implementation

72
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,120
uh multicultural segment shrouding

73
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,919
we decided to kind of keep them on site

74
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,280
we are still working and we are going to

75
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,960
refresh them but we are really waiting

76
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,000
for deployments and you know to better

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,400
understand requirement first sir

78
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,960
and we would also like to charter meet

79
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,400
next year

80
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,880
after both applicability statement as

81
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,720
well as based that

82
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,240
have passed

83
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,039
iot review

84
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,840
any questions comments

85
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,759
working group

86
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,240
caller

87
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,720
okay then

88
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,479
i will just make a quick comment on the

89
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,120
kv registry um we're probably just gonna

90
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,600
wait for the uh base spec before we go

91
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,479
working group last call but uh no major

92
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,280
changes needed at this time

93
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,759
okay make sense thank you

94
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,759
yep

95
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,319
okay this is to finalize working group

96
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,600
status

97
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,280
and

98
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,880
let's slide

99
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,159
we can go into presentation

100
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,120
okay i'll take over from here if that's

101
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,880
cool

102
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,919
uh so thanks chairs everyone i just kind

103
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,440
of want to take a few minutes to share

104
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,800
updates on uh auto evpn and next slide

105
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,039
please

106
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,400
uh so main changes from last time first

107
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,720
and foremost working group adopted thank

108
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,800
you everyone for that

109
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,039
beyond that we've started working in

110
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,440
some foundational components for data

111
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,520
center interconnect

112
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,680
variable derivation

113
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,479
with that came a few

114
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,039
considerations to how we elect the

115
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,440
top of fabric route reflectors

116
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,039
uh you know we also worked in some

117
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,800
multi-plane fabric components there as

118
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,840
well

119
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,800
we

120
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,880
increased collision-free scale uh tony

121
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,560
was able to squeeze some more out of the

122
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,400
hashing algorithms

123
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,080
and um we've also added a operational

124
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,400
section some of the feedback you know

125
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,080
indicated that it would be helpful and

126
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,160
get a little bit more detail and then

127
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,680
just minor restructuring nothing

128
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,199
terribly exciting there

129
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,000
next slide please

130
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,280
so dci gateways aren't anything new in

131
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,720
the general sense

132
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,319
but we've started working them into auto

133
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,840
evpn

134
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,560
most of the work so far has been done on

135
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,000
the

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,160
top of fabric route reflectors

137
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,199
basically we also allow them to

138
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,639
perform dci gateway functionality

139
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,879
so with that we had to factor that into

140
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,840
the reflector election uh first we are

141
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,319
advertising a new bit in the node tie to

142
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,960
kind of convey if a

143
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,280
top of fabric node wants to perform dci

144
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,560
functions

145
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,639
and then second we you know altered the

146
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,560
election schema a little bit which we'll

147
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,080
get into here

148
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,560
next slide

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,159
so looking at single planes

150
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,000
the previous election procedures were

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,760
pretty straightforward you know highest

152
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,679
lowest said second highest lowest

153
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,200
highest or lowest and so forth um

154
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,120
now we just work in that dci bit as uh

155
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,600
to prefer them so

156
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,279
now we would say you know highest hit

157
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,080
with the dci bit lowest with the dci

158
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,160
bits second highest and then if at that

159
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,920
point you know depending upon your

160
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,880
deployment like if we were to have um a

161
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,360
tough node that wasn't doing dci gateway

162
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,120
stuff we could just kind of fall back to

163
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,680
the typical

164
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,839
election procedures there so basically

165
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,519
we just to re-emphasize we'd prefer

166
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,200
the the dci component to it

167
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,080
uh next slide

168
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,720
and so for multi-plane uh we

169
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,279
basically take um among all of the top

170
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,120
nodes in a plane we

171
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,399
declare a plane id and that is

172
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,560
the highest sid from each of those

173
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,200
planes um everything's carried in the no

174
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,640
tie already

175
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,440
so the election is

176
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,760
distributed across planes as you know

177
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,880
highest plane id with dci bit lowest

178
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,959
second highest and same as before if we

179
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,839
have any that aren't doing dci uh we

180
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:56,640
just

181
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,399
fall back to it that way so this

182
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,959
basically will distribute um route

183
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,519
reflectors and the dci gateways across

184
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,040
planes for some

185
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,000
redundancy there

186
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,360
next slide

187
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,800
this one's pretty straight forward

188
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,519
previous scale was

189
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,200
you know three fabrics

190
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,279
each with three evis and each of those

191
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,760
with 15 v lines a piece now we can do

192
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,600
six fabrics seven edis and 30 vlans um

193
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,160
and same as before uh we can go higher

194
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,200
but we you know we have to define those

195
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,880
you know how those are derived so they

196
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,680
remain collision free

197
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,239
next slide

198
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,040
and last but not least um

199
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,399
we added an operational section um

200
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,480
there was some you know basically

201
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,920
feedback saying this would be helpful

202
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,600
and you know that

203
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,959
not only for single plane versus

204
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,360
multiplane sort of things but also for

205
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,120
you know those who are not incredibly

206
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,279
familiar with rift or auto evpn you know

207
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,279
uh to kind of help them bridge that gap

208
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,560
a little more quickly so there's some

209
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,320
example topologies in there that sort of

210
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,120
take

211
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,880
um

212
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,800
existing terminology you know from like

213
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
the physical underlay is a super spine

214
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,560
how that translates to rift is you know

215
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,959
top of fabric and then auto evpn is a

216
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,920
route reflector dci gateway um and

217
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
there's a you know full topology there

218
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,360
kind of showing everything

219
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,839
a little bit of restructuring basically

220
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,320
we folded the analytics section into the

221
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,640
operational section um

222
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,079
and then finally a little bit of a uh

223
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,079
you know quote-unquote pics performa for

224
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,440
this scale mentioned on the previous

225
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,760
slide basically there is a

226
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,120
table at the end of the document in the

227
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,839
appendix that you can basically use to

228
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,680
confirm compliance

229
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,839
with the current version of autoevpn

230
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,279
and next slide

231
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,440
um

232
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,519
so as always co-authorship comments are

233
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,639
welcome um but for for next go around

234
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,040
it'll you know more dci examples more

235
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,440
multi-plane stuff uh more operational

236
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,040
considerations

237
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,360
um

238
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,639
that's

239
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,839
it from my end um if there are questions

240
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,079
um next slide and uh if not maybe i can

241
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,560
steal a couple of extra minutes to go

242
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,480
through something that you guys might

243
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,399
find interesting too

244
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,320
please do

245
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
okay uh first off any questions about

246
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,800
them i'll jump to the next slide and i

247
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,160
guess first are there any questions or

248
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,000
comments about auto evpn itself

249
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,279
uh tony here

250
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,040
uh a quick observation so as input from

251
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,639
people playing with it

252
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,480
and there was a desire that the hash

253
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,079
function actually is delivering some

254
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,480
kind of a continuous you know simple

255
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,240
vlans uh for the fabric id one and edi

256
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,480
one is kind of the default case

257
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,160
so i'll be probably still fiddling with

258
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,600
the hash function to get you know in

259
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,160
fabric id1 ebi1 default case something

260
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,639
like you know vlan one two three four

261
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,240
five uh

262
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,079
instead of what do we have now where you

263
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,839
know we have one two v language and low

264
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,279
range and they start to jump up

265
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,320
probably for the next release

266
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,560
stick to the next slide

267
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,440
yeah let's jump forward two slides um so

268
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,720
i'm gonna kind of shift gears for a

269
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,800
second just breeze through something

270
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,079
um

271
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,399
so just kind of a quick teaser or

272
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,600
something we're working on that's you

273
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,040
know not directly related auto vpn but

274
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,199
um you know if you're interested in kind

275
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,399
of the

276
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,000
true ztp sort of um you know underlay

277
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,160
fabric sort of uh

278
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,279
provision this might be pretty

279
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,959
interesting for you uh just next slide

280
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,839
for me

281
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,560
i'm gonna kind of breeze over these

282
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,639
pretty quickly just just to provide some

283
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,320
high level context as to what we were

284
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,760
working on so

285
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,800
um

286
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
i think uh zooming out a bit we all kind

287
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,560
of know that you know flat single area

288
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,279
igps come with pitfalls you know lots of

289
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,560
flooding lots of state lots of

290
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,079
convergence

291
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,399
and this just gets worse uh

292
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,480
as the network scale but

293
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,320
there are

294
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,920
there are desirable reasons to deploy

295
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,160
these sorts of things like like sr makes

296
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,920
things simple um next slide

297
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,360
so one way we address that problem is

298
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,959
with flood reflection so it's based on

299
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,360
some existing lsr work um there's a new

300
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,920
version posted for the

301
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,199
don't know off-hand when the meeting is

302
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,639
but there'll be a new new one presented

303
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,320
this time um

304
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,560
but the at a high level work a little

305
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
bit like bgp route reflectors and that

306
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,320
we designate a flood reflector and we

307
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,399
have you know one or more clients

308
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,279
um

309
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,160
but the end result is uh we we get we

310
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,399
can squeeze a lot more scale out of

311
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,839
those sorts of networks so a lot less

312
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,760
state less flooding

313
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,120
you know less spf computation

314
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,839
next step next slide

315
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,920
so just for the visually inclined um

316
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,600
just if we had a really

317
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,279
basic example kind of comparing the two

318
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,800
you know if we needed you know full mesh

319
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,399
of level two adjacencies between you

320
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,120
know

321
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,720
tier one and tier three right that's the

322
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,240
only real reachability information we

323
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,199
needed um

324
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,759
flat single area we need you know 15

325
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,399
adjacencies um but if you look on the

326
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,040
right we have you you'd only need eight

327
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,680
so basically we have tier ones establish

328
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,079
those flood reflector adjacencies with

329
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,519
those nodes at the top are the flood

330
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,959
reflectors and those nodes at the bottom

331
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:47,920
are the

332
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,279
um

333
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,560
or the clients

334
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,600
um

335
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,639
again pretty simple to i think kind of

336
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,720
extrapolate the scale impacts there as

337
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,959
as you continue to grow the network

338
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,639
um

339
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,480
and next slide

340
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,040
last one

341
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
so basically you know what's this got to

342
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,399
do with auto vpn well we're taking

343
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,079
the same kind of technology the

344
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,240
automatic variable derivation and

345
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,920
applying it to that so we figure out the

346
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,199
cluster id

347
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,959
which is you know how we keep things

348
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,480
unique within the fabric and then you

349
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,160
know the the role whether it's a client

350
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,639
or a reflector so it's you know not an

351
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,240
incredibly

352
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,639
um complex addition to it but super

353
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,680
beneficial um so so stay tuned for that

354
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,240
um check out the check out the drafts

355
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,720
it's pretty interesting work um but

356
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,759
that's that's all i had

357
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,120
i don't know tony has any comments

358
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,759
oh i typed something quickly to the chat

359
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,040
um

360
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,800
which you know why the flood reflection

361
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
is different from normal areas

362
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,399
otherwise yeah we'll probably have a

363
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,279
draft uh out next itf with the whole

364
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,880
thing yeah

365
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,680
and that will give us a day zero flood

366
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,359
reflection technology basically

367
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,880
so these slides

368
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,119
are basically a teaser for uh for some

369
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,199
upcoming work

370
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,240
yeah yeah so the draft will be for 113.

371
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,199
okay

372
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,600
thank you

373
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,720
so for better understanding german

374
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,360
you're presenting as part of how to vpn

375
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,039
would it also apply to base rift in any

376
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,280
way

377
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,240
oh sorry muted uh

378
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,880
no this is a little bit separate

379
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,720
okay thank you just just sort of the you

380
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,080
know the auto edp on the sort of

381
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,000
automatic derivation sort of thing more

382
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,480
than anything

383
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,360
uh so it's basically the same thing with

384
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,520
auto vpn it extends the schema in a

385
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,000
minor way so backwards compatible but

386
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,360
there are some new elements on the

387
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,400
schema

388
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,559
mostly just to make sure that you don't

389
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,080
misconfigure it

390
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,240
that everybody you know in a cluster

391
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,039
just like auto vpn is kind of you know

392
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,280
in the same fabric right um

393
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,400
[Music]

394
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,240
so uh it it it touches the the base that

395
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,640
extends the base back in in a backwards

396
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,720
compatible way so you know the stuff

397
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,559
will run with base basic rift as well

398
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,200
but uh the extension will allow you to

399
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,799
run this auto dp and autoflood

400
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,919
reflection

401
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,320
uh but those things are completely

402
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,160
orthogonal to each other so the auto ep

403
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,919
and auto flood reflection are you know

404
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,679
independent you can run both you can run

405
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,000
either

406
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,400
and if you think about flood reflection

407
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,679
depending how

408
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,799
you know you build it you can actually

409
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,520
see rift just a day zero protocol

410
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,000
because uh auto flood reflection will be

411
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,120
able to even you know configure isis l1

412
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,679
and l2 or you can just configure l2 and

413
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,440
use rift underneath as a forwarding

414
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,880
protocol

415
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,840
will provide both options

416
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,240
it sounds pretty exciting to me

417
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,480
cool

418
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,840
so that is the only

419
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,559
agenda i think on the table today

420
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,559
unless we have any other

421
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,760
comments discussions

422
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,200
then

423
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,720
we can give you some time back

424
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,640
okay cool thanks everyone

425
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,160
bye-bye

426
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,720
thanks everyone and see you thanks folks

427
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,640
wherever we are going to be at 113

428
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,880
thanks

429
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,840
thanks

430
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,320
bye bye

431
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,240
you
