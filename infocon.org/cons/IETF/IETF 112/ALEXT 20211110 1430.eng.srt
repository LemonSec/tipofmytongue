floating around

people who might be quite new to your

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,160
area and don't know all the jargon and

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,799

thank you sound

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,600
all right uh with that said here's the

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,040
agenda

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,240
so

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,759
this is what we were planning to talk

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,240
about so far at this call if anyone has

40
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,799
anything you would like to to change or

41
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,479
talk about here

42
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,600
please

43
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,199
pop in the queue and let us know

44
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,000
hey mike

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,400
go ahead well i just do

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,520
i mean there's nothing changed really

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,920
for the um the drafts in progress

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,720
unfortunately since um

49
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,880
we spoke

50
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,640
what two weeks three two

51
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,290
um and the relations thing

52
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,320
[Music]

53
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,520
probably will take a little more than

54
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,158
five minutes

55
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,840
cool that's fine but i think that might

56
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,799
be this

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,399
yeah it's probably the same amount of

58
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,280
time

59
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,080
maybe less

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,720
cool the other thing i'd say just up to

61
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,120
start before we we get into this with a

62
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,520
group this small i think unless things

63
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,680
start getting a bit crazy about anything

64
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,760
feel free to just hop in and talk if you

65
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,440
want to talk rather than raising your

66
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,800
hands and waiting

67
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,120
to be requested and it makes things a

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
little bit smoother in a small group

69
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,160
like this

70
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,080
so mike would you like to control the

71
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,840
slides or do you want me to pop them up

72
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,840
and and go through them for you

73
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,480
if you could uh put them up for me

74
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,519
there's only

75
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,720
three

76
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,760
and the title cool

77
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,040
all right

78
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,440
let's move on then

79
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,879
so um

80
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,120
among the various comments uh

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,800
somebody um

82
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,319
said the security

83
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,760
section ought to have some comment about

84
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,800
uh the

85
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,120
the perils of xml because there's an xml

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,239
reference

87
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,120
i couldn't find any um anything i could

88
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,840
lazily copy and paste from anywhere

89
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,159
um oddly enough i did find plenty of

90
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,720
blog entries about the problems of with

91
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,640
xml things that uh

92
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,959
the xml specifications don't appear of

93
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,959
anything like a security section

94
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,599
so i think i made up something like

95
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,599
um

96
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,080
that last paragraph

97
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,680
uh the only thing i could find anyway

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,000
was a reference in web dev to the

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,720
problems with xml entities um basically

100
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,640
i'm just asking if anybody else's

101
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,518
knows of anything

102
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,519
useful i could point at or whether that

103
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,519
last paragraph will do

104
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,519
as a warning

105
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,319
to

106
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,040
read further um i guess if people are

107
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,280
using xml maybe they know the pos maybe

108
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,120
that's a wrong assumption to make

109
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,799
but

110
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,599
that's all i could come up with

111
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,840
but was the comment um

112
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,720
something generic or was it uh yes it's

113
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,639
just the generic problems with xml

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,160
because there's an xml

115
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,639
reference um

116
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,720
introduced in this relations draft and

117
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,320
it's just that given that we're pointing

118
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,960
at uh xml then maybe you should say

119
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,800
something about the uh

120
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,960
various uh securities who's surrounding

121
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,800
xml

122
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,880
which was a reasonable enough comment

123
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,800
just i couldn't find anything

124
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,360
um

125
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,440
yeah yeah so the comment was not uh

126
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,479
pointing to a specific problem no no no

127
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,440
no or something yeah no no it didn't

128
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,000
didn't offer anything like that so i did

129
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,479
some digging around and that's um

130
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,919
i would say the best i could come with

131
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,720
next within rfcs was the uh

132
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,840
web dev

133
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,639
um

134
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,479
spec has something about xml entities

135
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,199
which i think is the main

136
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,400
problem but

137
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,840
uh i'm sure there are others

138
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,199
um

139
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,120
but that last paragraph is essentially

140
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,600
where i was gonna i was gonna um

141
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,400
update the uh the spec with with that in

142
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,120
the security section which um

143
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,440
so that's that's the xml thing

144
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,639
um

145
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,800
and i think the only the only other

146
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,120
um

147
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,560
major comment is the next slide um

148
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,560
bronn

149
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,198
uh

150
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,080
this

151
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,160
spec has a a um

152
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,400
a link

153
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,600
property

154
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,199
which is um to allow allow you to um

155
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,919
specify a link to some external

156
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,000
object

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,840
which is um

158
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,840
not a countering object

159
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,840
and

160
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,199
uh we said in the draft

161
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,600
inspect that you should update the um

162
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,520
rfc 8288 with it which defines these the

163
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,360
link relations

164
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,720
and

165
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,440
mark nottingham who was the original

166
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,880
producer of that spec

167
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,400
made a comment that

168
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,880
either this spec should be a proper

169
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,759
serialization of that that link

170
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,319
that that spec iterated by is a link

171
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,919
header

172
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,520
and it and it

173
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,120
basically formalizes the um

174
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,800
links in html and atom

175
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,120
and it allows you to express them as a

176
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,039
uh as a link

177
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,639
header

178
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,319
and

179
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,720
what caught my eye was that what was it

180
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,360
the various types of link relation it's

181
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,120
useful to have something

182
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,039
where you could link to

183
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,039
external entities and say exactly what

184
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,960
type of external entity it was you you

185
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,720
were linking to so i um

186
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,560
this uh

187
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,800
was proposed some time ago without any

188
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,720
comment from anybody and then mark

189
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,319
nottingham uh was made aware of it and

190
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,199
i in actual fact as i read through the

191
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,000
spec again i think um

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,759
the relations draft actually is a

193
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,639
reasonable um serialization of the link

194
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,000
header

195
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,800
uh it's just i don't say so

196
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,840
um he defines a couple well three

197
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,560
attributes i think

198
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,319
one of which doesn't really apply but

199
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,240
the there's a type attribute and um

200
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,160
and a uh

201
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,400
a title attribute

202
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,160
the type is is

203
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,960
a corresponds to format type in

204
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,479
parameter in icalendar and the title

205
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,240
attribute corresponds to the label

206
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,280
attribute in in i calendar so both of

207
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,000
those actually are valid with with link

208
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,440
the link properly so i just need i think

209
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,440
i just need to say that's the case

210
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,680
um

211
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,599
i mean he suggested defining our own

212
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,639
registry or whatever we're not getting

213
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,319
tangled into it but i think that just

214
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,000
leads to more um

215
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,080
overlap and confusion because we're

216
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,560
trying to do the same yeah

217
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,880
i agree having having your own registry

218
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,479
is just more work

219
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,320
yeah and it just doesn't make sense

220
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,559
defining exactly the same thing and one

221
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,279
of the comments he made was well uh you

222
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,519
may get an idea whether it's whether you

223
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,959
ought to be using the same rights by

224
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,959
looking at the current link relations so

225
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,959
i hadn't actually um

226
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,880
been explicit about any of the existing

227
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,200
link relations i did define

228
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,040
a source

229
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,640
relation which is one of the things i

230
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,080
think we're missing in them

231
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,760
in

232
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,399
in i calendar is so where did this thing

233
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,839
come from

234
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,279
initially um

235
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,760
there is something of the kind for a um

236
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,360
a v counter object that cyrus defined

237
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,200
which allows you to reload the v

238
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,560
calendar object but there's nothing that

239
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,279
allows you to say where can i go to to

240
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,080
find a live copy of this thing somewhere

241
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,320
an event publication that's very useful

242
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,240
because you where

243
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,839
you may want to be able to point people

244
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,080
back to a site which is displaying

245
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,000
events or whatever which is what i do

246
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,160
with our calendar system so having a

247
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,200
source property would you link back to

248
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,040
the the um

249
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,440
the event as it appears on the site it

250
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,839
came from is is useful

251
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,320
um so i think i think i just need to to

252
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,920
be more explicit that this is a

253
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,399
serialization of the link link header so

254
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,800
i'll add a paragraph to make that

255
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,240
the case and i'll i'll actually

256
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,519
explicitly

257
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,040
um

258
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,200
uh specify that

259
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,160
uh

260
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,720
the label is the same as as title and um

261
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,519
and and format type is the same as type

262
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,680
in in that header

263
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,360
um

264
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,440
and they've got things like uh title

265
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,200
star or whatever which allows it for a

266
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,560
different encoding of um

267
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,120
of the title things i don't

268
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,000
think

269
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,920
that we would

270
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,880
uh do that i think if you want um also

271
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,480
if you want different um i think it

272
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,320
allows for accented characters and weird

273
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,000
things like that which sounds more like

274
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,519
localization

275
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,120
than um

276
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,000
anything else so i guess uh

277
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,360
we could

278
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,240
deal with that in a localization thing

279
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,279
and and

280
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,600
to address his comment about what sort

281
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,480
of overlap is there between um you know

282
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,240
current link relations

283
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,920
if you could go the next slide i um

284
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,959
i

285
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,880
noted a few of them

286
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,000
um

287
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,360
which

288
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,399
seemed immediately useful for uh

289
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,680
mostly in

290
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,920
in event publication but perhaps not all

291
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,319
together

292
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,560
we a long time back there was a

293
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,160
discussion in cal connect about

294
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,120
being able to add

295
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,399
um

296
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,560
copyright information

297
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,160
and

298
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,000
and so on to

299
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,320
to events and we we actually spent some

300
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,800
time discussing it and then and it then

301
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,560
just got dropped i think for some reason

302
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,160
i think the person who was trying

303
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,360
driving it

304
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,200
actually actually left

305
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,519
those those look immediately useful to

306
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,760
me especially in event publication being

307
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,079
able to specify

308
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,000
um

309
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,920
you know terms of service any privacy

310
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,680
policy if there is any

311
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,639
um and and the copyright information

312
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,720
just looks useful

313
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,399
author might be useful

314
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,079
um

315
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,480
payment actually we've had a lot we do

316
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,360
have a feature in our system where you

317
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,079
can

318
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,240
register for events and pay them that

319
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,680
might actually be useful

320
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,920
um there are a few other things a web

321
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,320
mention was an interesting thing

322
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,839
um

323
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,600
and and there's a whole bunch of other

324
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,360
ones that

325
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,560
i hadn't really noticed um

326
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,240
which look more like countering things

327
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,600
there's a whole bunch of them called

328
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,000
interval something other which relates

329
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,079
things together which seems to overlap

330
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,079
with the relations and the

331
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,160
the related two

332
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,160
temporal relations that i added but um

333
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,040
it looks like it might be another useful

334
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,160
um document on

335
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,079
how to use some of the other link

336
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,560
relations that already exist so i think

337
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,680
there's a lot that we could use

338
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,720
so that's that's where i am i just don't

339
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,480
i don't think there's any major changes

340
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,240
needed i don't think this could hold

341
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,680
things up

342
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,279
at least that's my my feeling

343
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,079
just a couple comments from uh from my

344
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,279
standpoint i

345
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,800
i want to agree with mike i don't and

346
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,480
brian i don't think we need to define

347
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,440
our own

348
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,639
registry

349
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,200
i also think that uh by using the format

350
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,519
type and label properties we actually do

351
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,760
have a serialization we just as mike

352
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,000
said we just need to mention that

353
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,639
and as far as the title star parameter

354
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,480
in in

355
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,440
the

356
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,360
actual hdb header i think that's for

357
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,959
non-ascii characters

358
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,800
and since we're utf-8 anyways i don't

359
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,959
think we have to worry about that mike

360
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,319
yeah okay yes okay

361
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,440
well i can i can i can explicitly say

362
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,920
that as well that it's utf-8 so your

363
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,279
title star doesn't apply in there

364
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,120
yeah so basically just adding my plus

365
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,320
one to your current uh

366
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
so i'll try i'll try and get an another

367
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,480
draft out oh

368
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,440
i'm sorry

369
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,480
yeah back on the uh xml issue this

370
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,240
working group's probably not the best

371
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,079
place to find people with a lot of

372
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,480
expertise in xml security

373
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,600
um

374
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,480
but

375
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,519
yeah i

376
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,199
that looked fine to me

377
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,000
okay i i just i guess francesca's

378
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,440
probably

379
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,120
the one to check with

380
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,800
as the responsible area director if

381
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,560
that's if she thinks that's going to be

382
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,079
sufficient

383
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,760
yeah i was i forgot to mention i was

384
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,880
going to say something similar it looked

385
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,560
okay to me but i'm not a security expert

386
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,240
and i'm assuming that the security

387
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,800
reviews will point out any deficiencies

388
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,440
if they feel the rarity

389
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,959
i don't i think the original comment it

390
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,720
wasn't so much that we need to go into

391
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,480
any detail about this but at least just

392
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,240
mention that there are security issues

393
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,959
with with xml so um

394
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,199
i think at least i've answered that

395
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,079
um

396
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,120
whether

397
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,639
having raised the issue other people

398
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,320
think it's sufficient

399
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,079
uh yeah i think we'll just see how that

400
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,079
goes

401
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,040
and as i was gonna say i'll try and get

402
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,399
another copy of this

403
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,800
another draft out in the next two three

404
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,880
days with these if that all seems okay

405
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,360
cool

406
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,399
that's what i was going to ask

407
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,360
you know just what the next steps were

408
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,680
yep

409
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,199
awesome anyone have any comments

410
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,759
questions beyond this

411
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,399
on this work

412
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,440
right back back to the agenda then the

413
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,480
next thing on our agenda

414
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,000
is ical tasks so

415
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,440
we don't have slides that i don't think

416
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,320
mike

417
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,720
no and i haven't

418
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,320
i haven't managed to um

419
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,360
do anything um

420
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,759
with the testing

421
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,759
in the last few weeks

422
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,800
uh

423
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,360
just briefly i think

424
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,120
i i this has been lying dormant for

425
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,040
a long time

426
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,560
and then i i noticed that

427
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,519
we do make use of some of the um

428
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,320
oh sorry can i can i just step back a

429
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,199
moment to to relations uh what one other

430
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,959
slight uh

431
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,920
make is

432
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,040
mark not even notice the relations draft

433
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,759
is actually um you know is referencing

434
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,000
that the h288 but in fact so does js

435
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,320
calendar

436
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,440
and um

437
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,279
and and ken's current so maybe we're

438
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,440
already due for another errata in there

439
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,839
in that

440
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,160
i think i guess what's going to happen

441
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,039
is we'll have to um

442
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,400
in some way refer to

443
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,280
what i

444
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,959
uh what i mentioned in the relations

445
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,959
draft in js calendar i don't know where

446
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,400
that where a good place to do that is

447
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,640
but i just raise that as an issue but we

448
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,799
have we do actually have this same

449
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,799
um

450
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,000
issue with with js calendar

451
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,640
so

452
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,679
all right

453
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,600
nearly happy for me to put the action on

454
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,879
you to follow up on that one

455
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,400
obviously but like i guess

456
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,200
cool

457
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,600
can see yourself fallen told

458
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,799
please be clear about it because

459
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,320
yeah that's right it'll be in the

460
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,080
minutes so we can chat about it during

461
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,480
the day

462
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,640
it's probably really just a matter of of

463
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,559
um

464
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,240
explicitly

465
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
referring to the whatever comes out in

466
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,120
the relations spec

467
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,360
uh sorry yes anyway back to to tasks uh

468
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,200
because they've been dormant so long uh

469
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,120
they've been the world has changed a bit

470
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,400
around it so

471
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,360
i need to uh update the whole

472
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,320
um spec to refer to um

473
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,120
the relations work that's moved on a bit

474
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,880
since then and

475
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,240
also

476
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,520
um

477
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,840
probably to make use of the participant

478
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,880
components to group things together

479
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,280
one of the big things that was going on

480
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,799
with with them

481
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,160
the tasks specification was to try to

482
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,080
improve um reporting of status

483
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,360
and also status related to particular

484
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,080
uh actors in the uh when you have a task

485
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,120
that's been carried out by um a bunch of

486
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,320
actors which correspond to attendees you

487
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
want to be able to relate to the um

488
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,120
status of that for per attendee or actor

489
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,640
in the thing so

490
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,320
that is

491
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,400
we had a uh a parameter

492
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,320
the group parameter which which

493
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,000
basically said this this is part of a

494
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,480
group of properties it was a bit of a

495
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,480
crude way of doing things and and it was

496
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,400
because we were frightened of having new

497
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,640
components at a time we stopped being

498
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,320
frightened of that so

499
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,160
um participant is a more reasonable way

500
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,360
to do that

501
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,480
um

502
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,120
and also the status

503
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,919
property in icalendar is

504
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,400
is really has it has the same problems

505
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,559
that you want more than just status you

506
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,720
want to have an associated comment and

507
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,360
all the rest of them and which we have

508
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,200
sort of that in um

509
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,600
in just counting so um

510
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,039
i think the thing to do there is

511
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,360
probably to just introduce a new

512
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
component

513
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,919
which groups those things together and

514
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,640
allows you to have a status um that's

515
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
much more complex

516
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,000
and so i i it's a

517
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,600
there's a fair amount of rewriting to be

518
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,439
done there so i i need to get that done

519
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,240
cool and yeah there was the the work

520
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,640
coming out of the jmap tasks as well it

521
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,400
needs to be we need to make sure they

522
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,760
stay aligned yes yes

523
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,200
all right i guess we'll probably come

524
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,480
back to talking about this when we do

525
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,640
the milestones but clearly the next

526
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,080
action is for you to keep working on the

527
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,120
document

528
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,120
yes

529
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
anybody have any

530
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,320
questions contributions for tasks

531
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,120
next up is js calendar icalendar

532
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,159
hello

533
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,320
yeah um

534
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,720
so the

535
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,520
basically there is unfortunately no

536
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,000
progress has been made since our interim

537
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,360
a month ago

538
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,960
um so that is um we are

539
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,039
still in a

540
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,280
design phase of defining the mapping

541
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,080
from gs calendar to i calendar

542
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,520
um or do the other direction already

543
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,440
as has been said earlier is already

544
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,360
supported quite well

545
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,480
um

546
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,000
and so what's waiting for us to go into

547
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,080
last call for this is to

548
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,960
have implementation experience uh

549
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,720
with mapping from js current to

550
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,919
icalendar

551
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,840
um

552
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,720
i'll put priority for the cyrus imap

553
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,640
server that we now

554
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,360
get started with this um so that this

555
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,200
rfc doesn't

556
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,360
lean us around uh too long

557
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,360
mike yeah

558
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,120
yeah i have the um another

559
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,679
implementation is that yes we um

560
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,240
and i've been a little bogged down in

561
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,440
there

562
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,200
trying to get a new release out but yeah

563
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,000
i will try and and um push along with

564
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,760
the uh

565
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,880
uh implementation of of um

566
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,360
of this mapping and the same time update

567
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,080
the place the spec let's see if we get

568
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,320
get it wrapped up

569
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,799
yeah i mean the

570
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,799
the um link object mapping in cheers

571
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,000
calendar

572
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,360
is is now also depending on the updates

573
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,559
to the

574
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,640
link definition that has been discussed

575
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,120
previously for the relationships yeah so

576
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,120
there is a bit of a there are a bit of

577
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,120
dependencies between these

578
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,640
um yeah that's what i was trying to

579
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,640
resolve with the uh the tasks and the

580
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,159
relations again the relations thing

581
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,679
moved along because

582
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,720
um

583
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,480
yeah there's there's a couple of things

584
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,360
that it depends on

585
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,400
yeah

586
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,720
okay so i i guess the next step is that

587
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,520
we

588
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,919
to get together and and sort this out um

589
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:26,960
how we

590
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,039
how we get started with this one then

591
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:29,919
yep

592
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,400
okay cool

593
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,080
yeah that's that's it

594
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,960
all right thanks robert

595
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,320
yeah it's just the one just the one

596
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,279
slide there so

597
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,480
not not much to do unfortunately in this

598
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,559
meeting because we met so recently the

599
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,360
last thing on our agenda is subscription

600
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,399
upgrade in this section

601
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,679
uh nothing extra to report even since

602
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,039
since i think the last itf it it's it's

603
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,440
uh my feeling is that

604
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,320
um there are one or two

605
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,760
um

606
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,200
the issues have been raised by who i

607
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,720
think they're more a matter of opinion

608
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,520
rather than than substantive

609
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,679
changes

610
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,400
i think

611
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,360
i think this is is probably

612
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,158
in a pretty good state

613
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,520
all right so i mean the question really

614
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,200
is do we do a working group last call on

615
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
it

616
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,520
now soon do we need implementation

617
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,400
experience let's let's say um let's say

618
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,799
very s very soon it's it's a smallish

619
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,320
draft so i i i probably need to re uh

620
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,360
take a last uh run through it

621
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,000
and and perhaps refresh it

622
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,520
that might be the thing to do is take a

623
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,600
a good look through it

624
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,679
um push out another

625
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,320
another version just to to refresh the

626
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,679
dates on it and then we can decide

627
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,120
whether it's good enough to get a last

628
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,760
call would that do it

629
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,440
yep that works for me

630
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,840
okay

631
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,240
all right the next item on our agenda

632
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,440
after this is future work section vpol

633
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,039
server-side subscription um planning to

634
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,039
once these documents are out what does

635
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,400
this working group do next

636
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,360
so i mean it depends probably a lot on

637
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,520
your availability mike

638
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,080
yeah people the uh

639
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,679
um i did i did do some updates on the on

640
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,760
the vpol um

641
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,799
spec

642
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,840
to make use of um

643
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,520
participant

644
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,880
component

645
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,679
um

646
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,840
we had we had a um

647
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,480
a component defined in there which is

648
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,600
the voter

649
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,480
um

650
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,640
and it makes a lot more sense to use the

651
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,559
participant

652
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,360
component that defined already

653
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,600
and so that i've i think i've

654
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,799
i've done that i i haven't updated my

655
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,840
implementation

656
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,159
fully and i think the um the only other

657
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,919
active implementation that might be

658
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,400
around which needs updating is cairns in

659
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,400
cyrus

660
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,640
yeah i have not updated it uh

661
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,720
to the current draft

662
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,120
and so i i think um it

663
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,279
i probably ought to again

664
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,960
uh take another

665
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,039
look at where i am with with that trap i

666
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,120
think it's i think it's um

667
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,440
i think i updated it all i can reap i

668
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,520
can publish it again

669
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,600
there's a new version and maybe that

670
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,679
will um

671
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,400
wake things up a little

672
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,919
cool

673
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,279
i off the top of my head i don't

674
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,960
remember what ken's got

675
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,400
work wise

676
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,320
in the pipeline at the moment i think

677
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,840
there's a couple of things just landing

678
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,120
and then

679
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,720
so what do you reckon can do should we

680
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,480
be able to get at this

681
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,279
start of next year

682
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,240
oh for sure yeah

683
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,480
um i can try to make an effort to have

684
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,279
uh updated implementation by

685
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,320
the merge itf if not sooner

686
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,440
yeah it'd be good to do some

687
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,520
interoperability testing again

688
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,279
once we switch everything around see if

689
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,880
we can find anyone else who wants to

690
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,679
play with it as well

691
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
yep

692
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,440
all right and service side subscription

693
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,679
was the other thing that was

694
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:04,720
specifically on the

695
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,799
list to talk about here

696
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:07,760
um

697
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,520
we i think we're still just waiting on

698
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,039
apple to get back to us on that aren't

699
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,039
we

700
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,039
think so yes

701
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,120
cool

702
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,039
um that is all we have on our agenda is

703
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,520
there any other business

704
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,200
you met brian you mentioned uh potential

705
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,640
future work are we still looking for

706
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,240
ideas for that because i've got i've got

707
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,799
at least one if you just want to throw

708
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,480
it out there

709
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,279
um

710
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,799
mike and i have talked this on on some

711
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,720
of our cal connect calls that

712
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,039
five five four five and four six

713
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,840
probably are due for a refresh

714
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,440
i'm just looking at five five four five

715
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,480
right now there's 17 there fight errata

716
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,159
there's

717
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,200
looks like seven

718
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,399
five other

719
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,559
specs that have updated it which could

720
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,720
probably be rolled in

721
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,440
and um given some of the

722
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,600
uh current discussion with dmarc and

723
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,559
imip i think 5546 probably needs some

724
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,840
new language

725
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,120
in terms of

726
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,960
how to properly

727
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,919
uh

728
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:24,840
deal

729
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,559
with um someone sending invites replies

730
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,720
on someone else's behalf

731
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,039
that said i don't know if there's enough

732
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,399
energy

733
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,399
in this working group to actually take

734
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,918
on all that work to um

735
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,000
one of the things i have suggested in in

736
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,120
the in the past that we we really are

737
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,399
lacking

738
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,520
is a is a document that is

739
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,799
um

740
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:53,600
just

741
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,000
specifically describes the the

742
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,960
countering data model

743
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,960
independent of of representation

744
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,080
it's it's sort of

745
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,320
you can disentangle it from my calendar

746
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,880
if you look closely enough

747
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,799
and when we have things like um

748
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,600
js calendar it's trying to support

749
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,919
essentially that same data model with a

750
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,919
different representation but it's really

751
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,000
hard to tell whether we're doing it

752
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,279
right or not and there are other

753
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,039
representations that

754
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,120
are around now and could be around in

755
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,799
the future

756
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,559
and and perhaps rather than simply

757
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,880
um

758
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,679
you know bringing out a new

759
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,480
unreadable document

760
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,320
um

761
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,799
we could consider the possibility of

762
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,840
producing

763
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
um a document that describes the country

764
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,919
data model

765
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,159
it it

766
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,360
it won't be any less work

767
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,159
but it it might um it might be more

768
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,840
valuable than simply

769
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,360
it's the kind of thing

770
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,320
i was going to say it sounds like

771
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,000
something similar to what

772
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,039
https has done where they split the wire

773
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,080
format from the actual semantics yeah

774
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,240
it's more valuable going forward because

775
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,320
i think it uh

776
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,640
it allows us to

777
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,519
define a different uh extra for other

778
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,159
formats and representations and and be

779
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,519
able to have something you can say will

780
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,600
it correspond it actually does represent

781
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,039
this data model

782
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,960
and it's what they do in oasis they i

783
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,960
think they are required to produce these

784
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,360
things they call like there's

785
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,519
pins and puzzles which is a

786
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,480
platform independent model and a

787
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,320
platform-specific model

788
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,880
which is you know one is the actual data

789
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,919
model one's a representation

790
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,760
i think it would make it make a lot more

791
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,279
sense i think

792
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,600
but it's still

793
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,559
probably a lot of work

794
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,360
i know that people in something like the

795
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,279
in the smart grid world

796
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,360
they really like their their uml

797
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,840
diagrams

798
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,559
they actually use that stuff for

799
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,200
so it it might it might

800
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,880
make sense to

801
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,530
investigate that

802
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:29,950
[Music]

803
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,960
yeah what we really need to do is find

804
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,399
some people who are

805
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,480
keen to to have some published documents

806
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,039
in their name and have lots of time

807
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,279
and in are interested in this field the

808
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,480
question is where do we find these

809
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,799
people

810
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,399
there there is actually a um

811
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,000
there is actually a data model

812
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
specification

813
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,279
um

814
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,679
which isn't complete but it it

815
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,360
it could be

816
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,519
um it could actually take a lot of the

817
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,320
work out of it it's it's going back to a

818
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,679
oasis

819
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:04,559
um

820
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,960
when we did ws calendar

821
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,279
they defined a um a a pin for

822
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,320
um the ws calendar spec which is a

823
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,440
subset

824
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,559
uh and a subset and a modification of of

825
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,200
i calendar

826
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,000
so it it may be worth looking at so

827
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,200
there may be there may be something to

828
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,600
start with

829
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,559
but um

830
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,960
i'm wondering um

831
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,240
um

832
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,240
to me if i have to refer to the model

833
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,080
i'm going to read the gs calendar

834
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,120
um

835
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,399
and i'm wondering

836
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,360
how

837
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,840
who who is the target

838
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,000
for such a document

839
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
and uh

840
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,320
how is it gonna be more readable than a

841
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,200
gs calendar

842
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,159
or um even if we

843
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,320
we take the

844
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,840
i mean the ical

845
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,840
specification

846
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,679
it's it's when you get around to

847
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,079
manipulating the data that the problems

848
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,399
arise

849
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,760
and

850
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,399
i kind of try you know the and you end

851
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,639
up having to go back to

852
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,320
probably at the moment you have to go

853
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,159
back to i calendar and i tip

854
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,918
what sorry we're talking about it is

855
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,280
different

856
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,879
like if it's just the the data model

857
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:35,599
like

858
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,800
jsc and i calendar i feel jazz calendar

859
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,639
does make pretty clear

860
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,079
i don't think the separate document is

861
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,399
likely to be much clearer um

862
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,918
json

863
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,719
the kind of json format is you know it's

864
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,399
easily representable in lots of other

865
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,679
ways

866
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,879
to

867
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,480
um

868
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,639
yeah it kind of almost is just giving

869
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,560
you the data model there now the itv

870
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,160
exchange on the other hand yeah i agree

871
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,560
the current docs are

872
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,160
very hard to understand properly

873
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,800
yeah i think we

874
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,200
probably want to try and

875
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,960
extend

876
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,320
to being able to to send a tip with js

877
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,400
calendar rather than just icon to

878
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,839
contact content as well

879
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,680
yes i think you you do it as just

880
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,720
another bit in your text alternative um

881
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,200
and yeah

882
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,119
yeah which will fall out kind of upgrade

883
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,920
parts as well to get away from it for

884
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,440
everything

885
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,640
yeah we can do easily

886
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,400
all right that sounds like it's

887
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,079
definitely going to be some upcoming

888
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,040
work

889
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,359
um in terms of actions from this

890
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,280
do we just leave it for now and and

891
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,440
start it later does anyone want to to

892
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,280
take on

893
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,079
proposing a document or

894
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,839
proposing work here i'm not doing right

895
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,839
now

896
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,280
i think we probably need to get our

897
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,280
current work off the table and then if

898
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,240
we do move forward with updating

899
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,520
the icalendar

900
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,680
base specs that might need a recharger i

901
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,040
haven't looked at our charter recently

902
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,160
but

903
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,440
i don't think that's going to be part of

904
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,440
it

905
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,359
well why don't i

906
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,839
share a screen

907
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,400
which is this one

908
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,720
this is what we've got in the queue

909
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,240
right now

910
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,160
relations is is getting towards the end

911
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,800
these documents we've just discussed

912
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,040
um

913
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,680
certified subscriptions

914
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,720
nothing's already in that list let's

915
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,839
have a look at

916
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,640
i think our charter gives us reasonable

917
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,160
scope to maintain

918
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,880
those we say we're going to develop the

919
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,280
specific things we've done

920
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,119
extensions will be backwards compatible

921
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,000
so out of scope is changes that impact

922
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,839
backwards compatibility with existing

923
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,000
stuff

924
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,079
and any attempt to develop non-gregorian

925
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,640
calendar systems

926
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,880
so yeah we would probably want to to

927
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,880
specifically say we're going to go back

928
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,280
and and redo all the documents i think

929
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,400
people might

930
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,880
might have

931
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,599
questions about

932
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,200
redoing them entirely rather than just

933
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,000
extensions too

934
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,359
it's not

935
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,720
well i mean i think it does any new

936
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,079
chart if it's not redoing them entirely

937
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,119
right it's just

938
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,440
putting all the errata in trying to

939
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,640
clean up some language we know is

940
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,119
commonly confusing um

941
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,040
yeah maybe merging if there's extensions

942
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,839
that should all be part of one

943
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,960
or not

944
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,839
so i think i would uh i would put the

945
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,640
isp and ask

946
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,680
before the surgery is absolutely

947
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,880
because

948
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,640
i mean it will be

949
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,200
reasonable

950
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,000
sounds very unclear i'm getting every

951
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,359
second word

952
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,760
oh sorry i'll write

953
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,240
that's much better

954
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,960
all right from from from the start

955
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,320
i try again

956
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,839
no it's not

957
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,640
i will just right

958
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,200
cool

959
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,320
thank you

960
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
foreign

961
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,119
yeah thank you francesca i'm

962
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,079
tempted if we were to do a recharter

963
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,960
to recharter basically to say this is

964
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,880
where all calendaring related stuff

965
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,440
happens we maintain

966
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,440
this whole set of documents

967
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,160
we do extensions to them we refresh them

968
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,480
when necessary please come here if you

969
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,720
have calendaring stuff

970
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,640
and and that way

971
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,440
we

972
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,599
say yes we we own and look after this

973
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,119
section and

974
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,040
work will happen here rather because

975
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,800
this

976
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,880
the length of a charter like this and

977
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,440
the very specificness of it

978
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,359
it does sound like it it's just it's a

979
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,200
waste of everyone's time

980
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,040
to be rechartering every time you do a

981
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,680
new document

982
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,839
um

983
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,520
yeah i agree

984
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,400
i mean

985
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,760
that's essentially what it is isn't it

986
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,880
yeah i am

987
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,640
so two thing if we don't need to

988
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,839
recharter

989
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,160
i i'm not for it

990
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,200
so

991
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,599
um whatever we want to do

992
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,480
if um if there is an agreement and it

993
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,520
can't fall in into the charter

994
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,480
um

995
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,119
it's it's good to avoid this work

996
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,400
if we feel

997
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,720
we do really have to recharter

998
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,119
then i agree with brown that um we

999
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,119
should not be so much specific um

1000
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,680
so to avoid uh rechartering uh every

1001
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,118
time we have a new idea

1002
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,040
so let me

1003
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,680
pitch in as the ad who originally

1004
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,760
chartered this working group

1005
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,400
uh the idea at the time was that there

1006
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,240
was a fixed set of things that needed to

1007
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,560
be worked on that was being brought in

1008
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,079
from cal connect

1009
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,160
and we chartered it to handle those

1010
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,599
items

1011
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,440
without the without thinking that it

1012
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,960
would be a long-running working group

1013
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,800
that would just keep

1014
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,160
processing new stuff over time

1015
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,480
so i agree if uh if if we're going to

1016
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,079
spend the time rechartering we should

1017
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,480
recharter it in the latter form as a

1018
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,400
long-running working group to deal with

1019
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,839
calendar stuff

1020
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,880
and i think that would be a good idea

1021
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,560
yeah i think there's there's going to be

1022
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,079
plenty to do

1023
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,480
by the time we refresh all these things

1024
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,839
there will be new stuff happening in

1025
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,280
calendaring space

1026
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,520
no doubt

1027
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,440
that i i disagree with francesca that

1028
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,520
chartering is a big deal

1029
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,240
it should not be a big thing to do you

1030
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,760
ought to be able to

1031
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,240
spend a reasonably short amount of time

1032
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,599
putting together a charter that

1033
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,599
describes what you want

1034
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,240
and um it's not a big process in the

1035
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,520
iesg it should take about a month so

1036
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,400
um so i i don't i think you should do it

1037
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,240
because then it gets you ready for the

1038
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,359
future

1039
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,839
and uh

1040
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,319
jim for berry um

1041
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,960
do you feel that

1042
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,440
um we should recharge her now or

1043
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,760
a personality this to be

1044
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,079
a long-running calendar

1045
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,560
um

1046
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,960
calendar related stuff working group

1047
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,800
that rechartering to make it clear that

1048
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,680
that's what this is is worth the trouble

1049
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,599
because then you will not get issues

1050
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:26,400
from

1051
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,960
ads saying wait how how does this fit

1052
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,400
into your charter

1053
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,560
and that's always a danger if you don't

1054
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,319
recharter that somebody might call you

1055
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,400
on

1056
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,920
and it's it's not like there's any

1057
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,920
competing groups trying to do calendar

1058
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,160
work

1059
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,640
sedate being the uh the date time stuff

1060
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,640
yeah no that's fine and i know one of

1061
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,400
the chairs in that group i'm sure i'll

1062
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,119
be fine with it

1063
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,720
all right um

1064
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,400
i'll do the first pass at this daniel

1065
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,760
and and

1066
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,280
discuss it with you

1067
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,760
sound good

1068
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,240
cool

1069
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,200
that's an action for me

1070
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,880
all right

1071
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,440
any other business

1072
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,560
you have milestones here

1073
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,240
yep that's the last bit

1074
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,880
here we go

1075
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,440
uh submit task draft to asg

1076
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,280
i think i think i was supposed to update

1077
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,640
this already and have not yet done so

1078
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,160
when do we think tasks going to get done

1079
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,280
um

1080
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,319
i'll try i'll try and get a new draft

1081
00:45:58,319 --> 00:45:59,520
out

1082
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,440
in the next next few weeks it's probably

1083
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,760
going to be

1084
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,119
you know sometime in december

1085
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,280
but i i may measure earlier

1086
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,359
um

1087
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,920
so we submit in january i guess by the

1088
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,839
time you had time to yeah

1089
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,240
this one time to look at it i'll i'll

1090
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,598
try and get out as early as possible

1091
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,200
cool

1092
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,920
subscription upgrade we that we said

1093
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,000
it's basically ready to go didn't we so

1094
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,520
yeah

1095
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,440
we should be able to submit that next

1096
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,720
month

1097
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,200
uh js calendar mapping document robert

1098
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,119
um js calendar

1099
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,079
is

1100
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,280
i'd say

1101
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,720
we should be done by april

1102
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,440
yeah

1103
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,010
cool

1104
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:56,640
[Music]

1105
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,960
calendar series um why april and not uh

1106
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,680
why april not later not before

1107
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,280
is it a specific day

1108
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,200
i thought the next itf is in april um

1109
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,359
okay

1110
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,240
okay because i i mean um one of the the

1111
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,480
reason i am raising that question is uh

1112
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,160
you mentioned that you need some more

1113
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,800
deployment so

1114
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,040
yes

1115
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,440
yes so um

1116
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,520
there are two things to that so for js

1117
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,359
calendar specifically um

1118
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,000
since we are in the in the progress of

1119
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,599
um um

1120
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,839
of working with chamber calendars this

1121
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:40,559
is also an occasion to um

1122
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,359
to finalize the mapping so that's about

1123
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,839
the time frame um i was looking at to

1124
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,359
get that done

1125
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:48,480
okay

1126
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,480
good

1127
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,400
all right uh calendar series mike

1128
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,599
yes

1129
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,200
this one has gone

1130
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,280
gone gone back to sleep

1131
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,160
yes

1132
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,160
it has for the moment but i need to wake

1133
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,319
it up

1134
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,000
what what's the date on there i can't

1135
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,800
see it so it's set for march 2022 which

1136
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,040
is already off in the future

1137
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,160
um

1138
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,240
but is that too aggressive

1139
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,000
it probably is given that i haven't had

1140
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,800
a chance to even look at it for the last

1141
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,839
few months

1142
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,599
um let's

1143
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,440
kick it to july that's slides at the

1144
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,319
asf out

1145
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,720
vpol is set for june 2022 i think that's

1146
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,319
far enough in the future we can deal

1147
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,559
with that at the next itf

1148
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,160
um and ditto server side subscription

1149
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,280
all right

1150
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,760
did we have any additional milestones to

1151
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,760
add

1152
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,240
i don't think so

1153
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,440
tasks is in their js calendar mapping

1154
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,640
documents and their subscription

1155
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,720
upgrades in there ico relations already

1156
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,279

1157
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:20,720
