on the other hand i know some people

7

to the microphone now

38
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
here's a slight one we might want to

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,200
have uh maybe during our administrivia a

40
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,079
uh

41
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,880
a uh very quick uh nod towards our

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,639
supposed charter update

43
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,959
uh yes um

44
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,520
so um

45
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,599
actually i've lost track why don't you

46
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,840
you handle

47
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,920
that you want that now or uh

48
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,879
yes finish the the okay so this was the

49
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,319
last one

50
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,840
okay so the chairs had agreed in uh oh i

51
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,280
see johnson q

52
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,879
but i'll say real quick the chairs had

53
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,360
agreed at the last ietf meeting that we

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,959
were to

55
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,720
discuss this charter update that we had

56
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,959
some proposed text from john and we're

57
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,280
going to discuss it with murray uh we

58
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,879
appear to have dropped the ball on that

59
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,879
uh so i had an email exchange with

60
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,040
murray last night and he is

61
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,239
okay with the wording that's presented

62
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,319
uh i want to hear what john has to say

63
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,080
but i was going to propose that maybe we

64
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,319
re-circulate that on the mailing list in

65
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,599
the next week

66
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,360
and get you know people a real quick

67
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,959
check on it and then we pass that back

68
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,920
to murray to execute

69
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,400
and john

70
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,239
yeah i was just gonna say i was just

71
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,959
gonna say that we um i did have a slide

72
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,319
about this in the connected identity

73
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,840
thing because really connect identity is

74
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,040
the thing that's actually waiting on

75
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,319
this

76
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,680
so like we can go over the

77
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,959
little bit of the charter relevant to

78
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,720
connect identity for that but i'm happy

79
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,400
to send

80
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,239
the proposed quarter text to the list or

81
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,760
if the chairs prefer to do it i think

82
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,599
you have it um either way works for me

83
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,360
that sounds good and i think

84
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,840
russell are we ready to switch over

85
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,599
i would suggest that murray start

86
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,120
processing

87
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,080
the suggested text immediately that

88
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,480
he can keep an eye on any working group

89
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,518
feedback as part of that processing

90
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,239
not sure if murray is with us but

91
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,640
otherwise we can uh uh close the loop

92
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,480
with him later today

93
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,280
yep hi i'm i'm on mobile so um i'm doing

94
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,200
my best to listen in but yes i'm uh i'm

95
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,599
around sync up with me

96
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,560
okay

97
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,760
okay

98
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,320
all right that sounds good so we'll move

99
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,399
to the first presentation

100
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,719
um

101
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,280
uh john or or chris which one's

102
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,199
presenting

103
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,199
i think i'll do uh connected identity um

104
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,320
since i mean

105
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,240
there isn't a lot uh to update us on

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,919
this so let me see if i can figure out

107
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,440
so i'm supposed to share the slides

108
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,040
myself through the

109
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,720
meeting materials or how does that work

110
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,440
it you can now do that all right let me

111
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,520
see so you click the little paper

112
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,800
looking

113
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,759
uh icon

114
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,280
this not working

115
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,520
the share pre-loaded slides icon

116
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,120
tried it i unfortunately seem to have

117
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,320
just like

118
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,400
spawned the slides as a

119
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,840
let me see

120
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,000
it's under your name a second from the

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,199
left icon under your name

122
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,840
oh i see

123
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,840
and then we have to approve it i guess

124
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,720
right

125
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,160
yeah once it

126
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,759
i i did

127
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,600
okay

128
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
um guys yes

129
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,160
i can't unmute i can't turn my audio off

130
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,440
and meet echo so i'm just going to mute

131
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,120
locally you can ignore me in the queue

132
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,199
okay is this actually sharing now

133
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,320
yes

134
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,440
because i i can't actually see it

135
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,919
we see your slides just fine

136
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,199
all right let me

137
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,440
ah there we go okay i got it perfect

138
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,039
this is my first time using this one so

139
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,960
so my apologies for that

140
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,600
so um yeah as you can see from the

141
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,280
markup at the bottom of this this is

142
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,800
kind of gotten kicked down the can a

143
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,039
couple of times we've run out of time

144
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,120
every time which it was why i assume

145
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,240
even though this is not a working group

146
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,520
item we're actually discussing this

147
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,479
first this time

148
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,360
um

149
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
so what is this again if you're just

150
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,000
coming in fresh or um it's been so long

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,600
that you don't recall so this is

152
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,160
revisiting john elwell's old um rfc 4916

153
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,400
which addressed back when the identity

154
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,600
header was described in rfc 4474

155
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,560
like what you did about uh responses or

156
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,160
what you did about like kind of figuring

157
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,080
out who it is you ended up connecting up

158
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,240
to when you place an invite the way that

159
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,479
we've described um the identity header

160
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,479
in rfc 8224 although it's pretty generic

161
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,120
to any sip methods practically speaking

162
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,680
it is um you know being used for invite

163
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,720
it doesn't say anything about what

164
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,080
you're supposed to do for anything in

165
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,919
the backwards direction

166
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,479
why this is particularly interesting um

167
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,479
there are a couple of

168
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,479
um either mid-dialogue or dialogue

169
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,639
terminating request potential

170
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,720
vulnerabilities to sip communications

171
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,919
overall

172
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,440
and um

173
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,800
you know i've heard about some of these

174
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
for example in the gsma about

175
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,080
shortstopping where there's an

176
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,680
intermediary network there's kind of

177
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,639
synthesizing buys to one side and not to

178
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,560
the other in order to do arbitrage

179
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,400
there's a whole bunch of like weird

180
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,520
um you know toll avoidance or

181
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,360
building maximization attacks people are

182
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
concerned about and even just like route

183
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,440
hijacking you know given how um

184
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,840
really it's often a matter of

185
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,280
provisioning i'd say rather than

186
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,360
consulting any authoritative database

187
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,960
how um the destinations of uh sift calls

188
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,720
ultimately terminate on the internet be

189
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,240
great if we had some stronger assurance

190
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,360
that things have landed in the place

191
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,039
that they're supposed to do problem of

192
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,360
course is that all this does take stir

193
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,120
quite far past the threat model of rfc

194
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,360
7375 which is primarily focused on

195
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,120
eliminating nuisance calling and a set

196
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,800
of related things like voicemail hacking

197
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,879
and swapping and so on um anything that

198
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,840
really is looking at this more

199
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,000
bi-directionally is going to be a bit

200
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,759
more complicated which is why we need a

201
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,960
charter update uh to pass it

202
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,639
so i said there's no new version right

203
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,560
um this is kind of been back bernard um

204
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,919
since we started having this rechartered

205
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,800
discussion um and we we have been kind

206
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,400
of punting on this the last couple of

207
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
times that we've gotten together

208
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,080
the last iteration

209
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,479
mostly focused on this pre-call case

210
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,720
which is really interesting to me uh the

211
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,879
medialis dialogue that can be

212
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,919
established um in order to allow the

213
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,720
connected side to reveal to the original

214
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,280
caller um who they are and to be able to

215
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,520
prove that cryptographically with stir

216
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,200
that much said there are plenty to do

217
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,320
here

218
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,120
like the um

219
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,958
you know we had a discussion i think it

220
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,399
was at the interim actually or maybe it

221
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,719
was a 111 i don't remember

222
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,040
about you know what some of the privacy

223
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,560
implications of this are because there

224
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,080
are definitely some risks about data

225
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,399
collection um if you can just kind of

226
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,720
form a medialis dialogue with some

227
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
endpoint you could well imagine somebody

228
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,320
trying to do that on a mass scale just

229
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
to ascertain what's supposed to be on

230
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,839
the other side of a given telephone

231
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,839
number so we're pretty concerned about

232
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,920
that this interaction with anonymity i

233
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,200
think is another thing i think that's

234
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,040
probably easier to resolve because we do

235
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,959
have so much text about anonymous

236
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,360
communications associated with uh stir

237
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,760
already but um there will be some

238
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
privacy considerations that are specific

239
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,160
to this particular use case

240
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,519
there's also been a lot of discussion

241
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,040
and this is something that you know i

242
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,120
thought about uh quite a bit

243
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,440
about having some kind of directory that

244
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,760
would allow people to look up prior to a

245
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,680
call whether they are going to whether

246
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
they should expect connected identity

247
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,360
from this destination

248
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,040
and you know this is something that is

249
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,160
really uh salient to a set of high risk

250
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,880
use cases like

251
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,120
health care government emergency

252
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,839
services things like that where it might

253
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,440
be handy for there to be some place that

254
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,680
implementations could look to know that

255
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,040
if they're not getting connected

256
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,959
identity like from their bank they're

257
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,200
supposed to and in the absence of that

258
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,240
especially as this is going to be an

259
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,080
incremental mechanism that's being built

260
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,640
on top of the existing stir uh ster

261
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,720
shaken infrastructure

262
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,480
that seems like a really valuable

263
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
property to have i don't know if we're

264
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,880
gonna articulate it in this draft i

265
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,680
think that service is orthogonal you

266
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,640
know in in terms of exactly um

267
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,720
you know certainly all this all this

268
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,560
works and can be specified at a protocol

269
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,920
level without the existence of that

270
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,600
service so i imagine that'll be like an

271
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,440
add-on that we'll look on look at for

272
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,560
this later

273
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,399
but nonetheless um that's something that

274
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,320
i know a lot of people are interested in

275
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,680
and then there's just a lot of like busy

276
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,800
work and this is the stuff i didn't

277
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,040
really want to do until i was confident

278
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,399
that the working group like wants to do

279
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,760
this draft like

280
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,399
um revising the examples you know we'll

281
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,000
have those generated from our

282
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,680
implementations chris and i will said

283
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,880
that those will

284
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,760
um

285
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,680
have the same things that john elwell's

286
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,760
original 4916 had um good uh

287
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,760
you know protocol breakdowns so that

288
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,360
implementers know what they're supposed

289
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,320
to do

290
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,000
and there may be especially coming out

291
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,920
of sip brandy and some of the things

292
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,519
that we did for that some actual

293
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,079
normative revisions to 4916 one of the

294
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,680
obvious ones is the elimination of the

295
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,399
identity info header uh which which uh

296
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,959
the 4916 examples assume so there's like

297
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,680
stuff like that that um is on the

298
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,640
roadmap for this

299
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:14,950
and

300
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,120
[Music]

301
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,760
so um yeah still plenty to do now we

302
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,760
need to think about it and really the

303
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,519
question before the group for the past

304
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,000
couple meetings has been adoption uh

305
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,720
pending of course the recharter and i

306
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,079
did have one side that just kind of

307
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,640
shows what the charter text

308
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,040
would be that is salient to this that

309
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,200
goes beyond what stur's original scope

310
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,160
was

311
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,600
and this is really opening up um

312
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,440
you know mechanisms that identify the

313
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,680
called party uh how that that the called

314
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,920
party reached the calling party and then

315
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,000
similar use cases related to fraud and

316
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,200
security that fall under that rubric

317
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,040
and so we really yeah just take take a

318
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,880
look at the charter text

319
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,720
it'll be circulated on the list in front

320
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,760
of murray

321
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,120
and if it all seems good then we will

322
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,680
adopt and start filling in the many gaps

323
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,040
that we know we have in this one

324
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,760
any questions comments some i should

325
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,480
bring the chat up

326
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,120
i don't see any chat

327
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,720
comments any thoughts

328
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,480
anybody come to the conclusion this is a

329
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,800
terrible idea

330
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,760
hearing

331
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,079
none then i guess we will proceed with

332
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:32,959
the

333
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,399
next steps

334
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,120
as articulated there

335
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,480
and with that i will take these slides

336
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,279
down

337
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,480
and

338
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,560
we can move on to the next thing

339
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,480
there are some looks good to me and plus

340
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,279
one's popping up in the uh in the uh

341
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,120
chat yeah he knows yeah yeah

342
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,680
um this is murray and i the charter the

343
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,920
diff charter text i think i saw

344
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,800
uh looked like a great starting point

345
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,000
fantastic

346
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,600
yeah let me know if there's anything

347
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,720
more we need to patch in

348
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,079
does anyone want to argue that we

349
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,880
shouldn't adopt this work

350
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,440
and yeah i mean i i will say um you know

351
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,959
i'm aware that this is going to be a

352
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,440
lift in terms of where stir shaken is

353
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,000
today this is like stir shaken 2.0 kind

354
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,279
of stuff right

355
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,560
um and so but i mean there are just so

356
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,639
many use cases

357
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,880
as star shaking has now been rolled out

358
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,199
you know mandates are passed here in the

359
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,440
us and so on um

360
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,279
you know we're getting to a point now

361
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,720
where more people are going to try to

362
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,199
repurpose it for these broad use cases i

363
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,760
see this more and more and that just is

364
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,959
going to require

365
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,480
protocol level support that we did not

366
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,440
anticipate when we did the original uh

367
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,320
8224 and so on

368
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,639
we have jack in the cube

369
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,720
jack and the queue what's up guys

370
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,279
hi yeah so

371
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,079
this

372
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,160
so i i feel like my opinion on this is

373
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
that it's this is quite neat i quite

374
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,440
like the idea

375
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,000
my only hesitation is that it's quite a

376
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,320
lot like it's quite a big change

377
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,639
and it's a reasonable amount of work to

378
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,800
do all of it and get it all adopted and

379
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,920
working

380
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,040
and

381
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,120
i'd like to be a bit more confident that

382
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,720
people are actually going to find use of

383
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,279
it like

384
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,720
because it would be quite easy to

385
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,000
standardize something like this and just

386
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,320
no one ends up using it but also it's

387
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,920
quite cool so maybe they will just use

388
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,560
it but yeah i don't really know

389
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,399
yeah i mean like i said i do i do

390
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,079
recognize it's a lift i think the

391
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,920
motivation for that lift is going to

392
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,120
come from these silos that actually

393
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,199
require it right this is something that

394
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,839
if emergency services requires this if

395
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,399
like big banks been powerful enterprises

396
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,440
that have a lot of leverage with

397
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,959
carriers and that's what carrier vendors

398
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,760
require it government agencies require

399
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,160
it so that we can stop some of these irs

400
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,240
scams and things like that i mean it the

401
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,839
the actual drive for it will have to

402
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,680
come from them i think that's the only

403
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,199
thing that will really make the vendors

404
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,079
move the needle on this

405
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,199
i want to promote a comment that robert

406
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,480
made in the chat into the audio which is

407
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,160
we've talked about this before we've

408
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,399
pretty much agreed to go do this in

409
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,000
previous conversations

410
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
so yeah we're kind of taking a check on

411
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,160
that now but unless one someone has some

412
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,839
strong opinion that we should change our

413
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,040
path

414
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,320
we've

415
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,839
which already wanted to do this we were

416
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,759
just waiting for the charter

417
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,959
so

418
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,680
let's get that done

419
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,240
sounds good with that i will get out of

420
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,639
the video

421
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,320
okay chris

422
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,920
uh no you're still muted

423
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,240
are you locally muted too

424
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,360
they don't see that he had grabbed audio

425
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,320
well he's gone now

426
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,199
should we switch over to whatever john

427
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,240
had next and then come back

428
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,000
well he's still

429
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,519
here

430
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,079
there he is

431
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,519
okay you want to share your own slides

432
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,519
sure

433
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,160
you see that

434
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,959
looks good

435
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,640
good

436
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,199
okay um

437
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,160
i've updated the identity header error

438
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,119
handling draft still individual at this

439
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,480
point

440
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,000
um but uh in the

441
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,400
interim meeting we had another great

442
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,559
discussion

443
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,039
and i think the major outcome of that

444
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,039
discussion was

445
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,020
that

446
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,520
[Music]

447
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,039
we would switch from sip as a

448
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,130
protocol reason code

449
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,320
[Music]

450
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,639
and define a new stir reason code

451
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,039
[Music]

452
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,360
both from the perspective of use

453
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,840
multiple

454
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,919
if you get multiple reason headers and

455
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,480
formally define that um

456
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,520
although robert has offered to author a

457
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,120
separate zip core document that

458
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,920
explicitly adds that to

459
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,240
[Music]

460
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,480
extend the 3261

461
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,120
definition

462
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,039
but also we thought that was a a good

463
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,240
path forward to separate stir specific

464
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,080
reason codes because

465
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,640
uh we do have a little bit of explicit

466
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,840
ways that we use that um

467
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,720
both in ietf context and also with stir

468
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,880
shaken uh

469
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,520
there's text specific to that in in the

470
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,919
shaken standards

471
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:46,880
uh

472
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,120
so i just included this and really the

473
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,120
only change we're proposing here is stir

474
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,840
but that did um

475
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,240
actually create a you know a bunch of

476
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,880
changes in the document to

477
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,440
to set the context

478
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,080
for those things so a lot of changes in

479
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,400
the document but all to say

480
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,200
essentially the same thing

481
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,440
um

482
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,640
so i think

483
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,400
hopefully we're in a pretty solid path

484
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,760
forward now and um i think you know it

485
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,480
was

486
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,000
i think we had a lot of great discussion

487
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,919
and good collaboration and ended up in a

488
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,440
good place

489
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,760
on this so

490
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,520
you know let me know if there's any

491
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,919
questions or comments related to the

492
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,360
changes i made but um

493
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,760
and if i incorporated everybody's

494
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,480
thoughts correctly but otherwise

495
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,120
hopefully we're we're set to to move on

496
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,120
i'm not hearing any comments

497
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,360
so

498
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,280
jack

499
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,440
yeah this might actually be better just

500
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,480
for the mailing list but um

501
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,880
the one thing that still

502
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,280
sticks out me is the security

503
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,600
implications

504
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,520
uh this might just be me uh not

505
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
understanding how this works properly

506
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,200
but

507
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,240
you have to remove the reason header as

508
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,400
it propagates upwards just so you don't

509
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
leak information

510
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,600
if i had

511
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,880
must

512
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,159
if

513
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,320
a

514
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,440
um

515
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,280
authentication service doesn't yet

516
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,440
understand this spec

517
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,120
is it just going to end up folding

518
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,159
everything up anyway

519
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,000
as in are we even able to write musk

520
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,120
there because people who don't

521
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,880
understand the spec are going to not do

522
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,120
that

523
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,799
um i think there's

524
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,880
certainly

525
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,960
potential danger in that although i

526
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,200
don't think people are used to dealing

527
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,080
with

528
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,480
multiple or early enough that people

529
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,470
aren't used to

530
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,440
[Music]

531
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,280
well i guess that doesn't matter whether

532
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,120
there's multiple or not um

533
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,200
i guess you know personally i

534
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,400
question

535
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,120
how much risk there is for the

536
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,200
for this situation but you know i

537
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,440
certainly understand and support the

538
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,559
ability to uh strip it at the

539
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,000
authentication service that uh sent that

540
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,360
um so yeah i think it's really up to the

541
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,799
group whether

542
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,120
how much how how concerned we are about

543
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,200
that but i think we're still in early

544
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,799
days enough that

545
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,158
hopefully people catch on

546
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,720
does that make sense or

547
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,000
yeah i think that's right um

548
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,440
yeah i'll have a better think about it

549
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,720
i think it's the answer and raise it in

550
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,080
the list

551
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,039
but otherwise i really like this

552
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:09,919
great

553
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,200
yeah there's certainly time to think

554
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,880
about it so yes please think about it

555
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,440
there are some please adopt

556
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,480
comments in the chat

557
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,240
we shouldn't adopt this

558
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,679
and i'm not seeing that

559
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,158
and brian's in the queue

560
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,159
i mean this is just

561
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,039
um

562
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,880
usually when we want to do something

563
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,200
like this we we add some kind of options

564
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,960
mechanism that lets the downstream

565
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,240
entity know

566
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,360
the upstream entity know if the

567
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,760
downstream entity can do deal with it

568
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,559
and

569
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,080
maybe there's something we could do here

570
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,760
and then you wouldn't send it unless it

571
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,520
was unless the other end implemented and

572
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,679
it was prepared to handle the security

573
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,559
stuff it's just an idea

574
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,880
that you could consider if you think i

575
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,480
i'm i'm kind of with you that i don't

576
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,559
think there's much of a problem here

577
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,880
but if people are was we could come up

578
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,960
with some way of knowing if the

579
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,679
downstream entity

580
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,280
well i think i think it's the other way

581
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,240
around that um or at least if i'm

582
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,480
interpreting jack's comment correctly

583
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,280
that

584
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,360
the authentication service has

585
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,159
implemented the stripping

586
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,640
abilities yeah if when they get it back

587
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,720
okay all right that definition of

588
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,799
upstream and downstream confused but but

589
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,720
but we could we could come up with a way

590
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,799
to do that if that was really important

591
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,320
okay yeah

592
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,480
thank you

593
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,919
so i don't think we're seeing any uh

594
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,279
opposition in this room today to uh

595
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,480
adopt this

596
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,400
i would propose we probably ought to do

597
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,600
a uh

598
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,360
call for adoption to the list very

599
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,880
shortly

600
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,320
that's right russ and robert

601
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,600
i'm taking a note

602
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,000
okay

603
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,520
what you said was cut off to me anyway

604
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,400
say again ben i didn't hear that

605
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,080
i was actually

606
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,520
i think we'll do

607
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,400
uh three weeks given the

608
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,799
time of year

609
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,600
sounds good and apparently i was cut off

610
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,760
telling russ that he was cut off

611
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,000
got to be

612
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,400
okay i

613
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,200
well i was gonna prep for the next slide

614
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,120
did you get a slide request

615
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,640
thank you

616
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,400
but i also wanted to make sure

617
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,440
we're done with uh

618
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,440
i think we were right

619
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,000
i think we're done with error handling

620
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,960
thank you okay

621
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,760
so i'll move on to the next one

622
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,320
rcd

623
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,480
um

624
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,799
i tried to um

625
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,720
you know i really sent back to the

626
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,880
interim which again was great

627
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,960
conversation so thank you all for

628
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,200
participating

629
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,799
um

630
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,559
i created a

631
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,159
a pretty lengthy checklist of um items

632
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,360
to make sure i fixed in the document and

633
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,570
hopefully i cover them all

634
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,679
[Music]

635
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,840
um and i tried to enumerate them in the

636
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,080
slides here so we can go through there's

637
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,919
probably a few that hopefully are

638
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,159
straightforward a few that may have some

639
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,320
more discussion points but

640
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,439
let's go for it

641
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,080
um

642
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,480
so one was a comment from ben

643
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,159
uh

644
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,159
about jcl key being defined as an https

645
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,720
url

646
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,120
asking do we want other uri types

647
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,400
call info

648
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,760
rcd

649
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,720
the sip core rcd draft

650
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,760
we don't

651
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,320
specify that i guess keep it sort of

652
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,640
default

653
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,760
i think my opinion is that we should

654
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,679
limit it to

655
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,679
https urls so i would maybe rather just

656
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,159
say that in the call info draft

657
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,520
but curious

658
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
for opinions on that and whether they

659
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,000
think there's other use cases that are

660
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,600
applicable

661
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,399
ben

662
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,959
you're coming

663
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,240
the use case that i had in mind

664
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,480
was when you have something that's in

665
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,640
another body part

666
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,720
and you're using what is it a data url

667
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,960
scheme i can't remember the scheme name

668
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,399
but when you have something that's

669
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,159
actually in the message in another body

670
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,399
part

671
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,880
yeah

672
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,799
i think we've talked about

673
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,600
using that mechanism in different

674
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,159
ways and we always went away from it but

675
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,200
um

676
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,080
yeah go ahead john

677
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,480
i mean uh you can use the cid url for

678
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,080
this like eat the mind body that it

679
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,799
resides in i mean i think that

680
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:05,600
the

681
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,480
you know

682
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,480
there's always the kind of sick purists

683
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,720
do we really wanna like have these mind

684
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,760
bodies be inserted by uh intermediaries

685
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,720
potentially right and you know that

686
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,640
that's always made me a little

687
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,640
uncomfortable about that because we

688
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,039
don't the use cases we're envisioning

689
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,120
for a lot of these at least aren't ones

690
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,919
where

691
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,679
it's the actual originator of the invite

692
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,200
who's gonna be the one that's generating

693
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,679
it but we could also argue that protocol

694
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,520
purity shift is longs and sale there's

695
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,720
like absolutely no reason we should be

696
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,000
worried about that

697
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,840
like i i would be fine with it being cid

698
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,279
um

699
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,840
you know i think then the question

700
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,080
becomes like what the integrity

701
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,960
protection properties of that are right

702
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,559
and um

703
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,399
you know if we're concerned about that

704
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,480
potentially being altered in transit

705
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,799
some somebody putting uh you know

706
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,960
advertisements or something like you

707
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,039
know into uh jay card as the message

708
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,120
goes by or something like that if we can

709
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,200
like those things then i think it's it's

710
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,600
doable

711
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,799
i think it's doable but you know like do

712
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,480
we really think people are

713
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,399
gonna do it or do we really think we

714
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,320
want to recommend doing that and you

715
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,240
know it's just another implementation

716
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
thing that people

717
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,720
may have to support um that that would

718
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,480
be my concern

719
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,799
go ahead then

720
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,240
my impression

721
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,159
is that

722
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,919
operators and such that are likely to

723
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,080
actually use rcd are still really

724
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,360
figuring out how they want to do some

725
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,520
things

726
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,640
and

727
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,200
i i would be hesitant to take cid off

728
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,559
the table

729
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,840
just yet

730
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,159
maybe they'll use it maybe they won't

731
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,600
but it would be inconvenient for them to

732
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,200
come back later and say hey you know we

733
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,720
really wanted to use that i guess you

734
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,480
know we can always update rvs

735
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,360
that is a good point um

736
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,000
have certainly had a few conversations

737
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,919
about you know call info versus claims

738
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,360
um

739
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,720
both or

740
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,240
either or

741
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,919
um which i think is an industry

742
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,440
discussion that needs to happen also

743
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,000
um maybe that sort of convinces me we

744
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,960
should do it but uh who is next brian or

745
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,760
john

746
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,120
i forget if it goes up or down

747
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,000
go ahead i mean

748
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,200
yeah yeah i i mean so you're pointing at

749
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,200
the data url it's an interesting one too

750
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,960
because of course you could encode the

751
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,080
entire j card as a data url and like

752
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,760
embed it in

753
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,240
like the um in the call info header

754
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,520
itself right which is ugly and appalling

755
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,000
and we shouldn't do that i'm i'm afraid

756
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,320
that's the kind of thing people will do

757
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,120
if we don't provide like some way for

758
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,919
this to work a bit more responsibly

759
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,200
um

760
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,640
i mean i

761
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,720
from what i can tell

762
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,919
i mean i

763
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,080
i guess i understand most people that

764
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
are looking at this are looking at the

765
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,559
jcl actually being https url at this

766
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,200
point it is so early that i don't you

767
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,360
know i'm hesitant to close doors as well

768
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,880
i think it is very possible for us

769
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,320
though to just say

770
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
look you know here in this document

771
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,279
we're specifying https as like a primary

772
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,600
mechanism and leave the door open for

773
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,320
people to propose alternate uri schemes

774
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,640
for this in separate extension

775
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,000
specifications

776
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,360
does that work for people

777
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,279
we've been using info in emergencies a

778
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,399
lot

779
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,519
um to pass information between pieces

780
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,080
that get added to an emergency call as

781
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,840
it gets processed through the system and

782
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,600
we uniformly allow cid as well as https

783
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,320
and that's it i mean it's https

784
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,120
or cid you get exactly the same data

785
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,519
it's just is it come in line or is it

786
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,000
com it's by value or by reference that's

787
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
exactly how we describe it you can pass

788
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,480
it by value reference and what we found

789
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,000
is

790
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,600
people wrote that code once and they use

791
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,279
it all over the place

792
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,240
and and i i

793
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,320
i think it's useful

794
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,960
i see people using by reference much

795
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,360
more often than by value but

796
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,320
i also think it's useful and that just

797
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,640
do it allow it

798
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,000
cid

799
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,320
so you're saying you just to clarify

800
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,159
you're you you are seeing people use

801
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,200
that and yeah you need cid less often

802
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,640
than by value

803
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,880
right

804
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,080
it's it's when the the vendor doesn't

805
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,320
want to me when one side just doesn't

806
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,399
want to maintain a web server that they

807
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,480
have to allow access from folks that

808
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,320
they don't have a lot of control over

809
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,919
then they put it in by value and it's

810
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,279
gone they don't have to worry about it

811
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,200
anymore

812
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,440
right

813
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,360
good

814
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,760
isn't that exactly what jcd is though

815
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,080
jcd is by value jcl is by reference

816
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,480
good point

817
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,959
okay maybe um

818
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,960
maybe uh i'll

819
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,799
maybe i'll try to mention that on the

820
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,960
list again and generate a little more

821
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,720
discussion and think about it a little

822
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,720
more um

823
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,760
i i i'm not sure we have a clear

824
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,679
direction but

825
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,679
maybe i'm sort of slightly leaning

826
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,720
towards keeping it or

827
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,760
adding cidcid i guess to the rcd but

828
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,919
and i haven't been watching the chat

829
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,919
either

830
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,239
okay um

831
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,000
i said the chat is fairly reflective of

832
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,440
the voice discussion

833
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,000
yeah okay yeah let me move on make sure

834
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,199
we uh cover everything

835
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,078
all right um

836
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,720
so there was a couple of things around

837
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,159
namm and apn

838
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,440
specific to default usage

839
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,599
you know things about

840
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:49,119
reflecting the same values in j card

841
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,719
those types of

842
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,719
comments

843
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,639
uh

844
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,280
so i really just added you know similar

845
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,320
to

846
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,079
namm that apn must be used um so there

847
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,160
must be a like if you're intending for

848
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,839
an alternative

849
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,400
number to be displayed then you must

850
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,280
include it in apn and not rely on people

851
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,160
also

852
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,480
you know going into the jcl and that's

853
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,680
specific to you know for supporting

854
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,079
textual clients and

855
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,280
uh things that may not want to go into

856
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,119
the j card or support j card

857
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,440
any comments about that

858
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,960
i think that's pretty consistent with

859
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,680
the discussion

860
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,040
okay we'll move on to the next one

861
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,119
uh we talked a little bit about adding

862
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,520
to security considerations the need for

863
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,079
vetting so i added some text in there

864
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,000
i'm not going to read through that

865
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,920
but it really essentially says that you

866
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,760
should vet

867
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,480
all identities alternative alternate

868
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,119
identities etc

869
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,560
okay

870
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,200
um

871
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,320
yeah this is along the similar lines

872
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,160
uh but this is in the body of the text

873
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,520
so again addressing the uh

874
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,680
you know we say that we're not dictating

875
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,119
any policy in in this document but uh

876
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,760
vetting is important

877
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:28,960
um

878
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,839
so next issue uh

879
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,000
fixing consistency

880
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,160
with the rules with constraints

881
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,440
um so i talk about in both the rcd usage

882
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,839
and the rcdi usage

883
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,280
uh the use of permitted values

884
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,079
um that it may contain multiple entries

885
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,880
uh i have this thing about

886
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,880
um

887
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,920
only

888
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,560
only including permitted values so that

889
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,800
you have the option of

890
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,320
having

891
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,480
values that

892
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,160
are required but also not having have

893
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,480
the ability to not have an rcd claim as

894
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,720
well

895
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,800
that was part of some discussion

896
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,160
rcdi is sort of a variant of that but

897
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,839
it's sort of in the opposite direction

898
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:27,520
so having an rcdi implies having rcd um

899
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,760
so the rules are slightly different

900
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,680
um but the

901
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,760
the concept is similar that you

902
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,079
must include for rcd claims

903
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,839
sorry just reading through this

904
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,200
yeah just trying to cover all the

905
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,480
different

906
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,599
all the different

907
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,640
um

908
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,760
permutations of must include

909
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
rcd rcdi

910
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,640
um

911
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,079
people can read through that and comment

912
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,599
unless anybody has any real-time

913
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,480
comments for them

914
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,160
i think the key thing was in my mind was

915
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,160
whether or not we want to explicitly

916
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,119
include this one that allows for

917
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,079
having either no rcd or

918
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,240
permitted values

919
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,760
and whether that was an important use

920
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,800
case

921
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,400
i think that was the only one that was

922
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,320
maybe borderline in my mind but

923
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,800
not hearing too much feedback so i'll

924
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,200
move on

925
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,090
uh

926
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,269
[Music]

927
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,560
yeah so this was uh something we had

928
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,240
pretty extensive discussion on

929
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,160
the verification of integrity

930
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,040
if the url is not being used by the

931
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,680
consumer

932
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,720
there was a couple of proposals that i

933
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,560
took notes on

934
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,440
um

935
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,320
i think i actually shared on the list

936
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,200
what i

937
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
proposed in the text and then obviously

938
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,640
in the document that i uploaded

939
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,079
um which is specifically i added the

940
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,920
last paragraph here

941
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,839
um

942
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,000
so this was sort of my compromise

943
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,200
proposal um i got some support for that

944
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,599
i think maybe some question marks

945
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,560
any comments that anybody wants to

946
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,200
mention here

947
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,118
related to this item

948
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,919
jack

949
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:45,119
i definitely don't think this is

950
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,320
the right

951
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,400
wording

952
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,560
um

953
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,960
specifically because it of that third

954
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,400
bullet existing

955
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,880
i just don't think that's

956
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,760
sensible to have

957
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,160
and

958
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,040
i i yes i i sent an email to the list

959
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,640
with like um

960
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,680
uh more explanation of why i didn't

961
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,040
think that that was right

962
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,160
but

963
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,480
yeah

964
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,480
yeah

965
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,400
i mean i i guess we're sort of trying to

966
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,640
straddle a line of um

967
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,599
you know i just wonder if some of the

968
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,359
concerns are more something part of an

969
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,079
ecosystem that has more policies

970
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:38,800
for

971
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,040
for those things that can be clarified

972
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,240
in those ecosystems

973
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,920
yes but this has to support that and i

974
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,440
don't think that the way this is worded

975
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,400
at the moment this supports that

976
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,560
ben you want to go

977
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,520
i agree with jack here we had some uh

978
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,400
email discussion after your uh i guess i

979
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,720
think it was after the last revision

980
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,960
and i had made a proposal that i don't

981
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,640
remember the exact words but along the

982
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,400
lines of there's really two separate

983
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,560
kinds of verification here

984
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,720
one is to verify that your passport

985
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,000
is correct

986
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,119
and that verification is you verify the

987
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,359
signature you verify

988
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,960
the jwt claims constraint and a passport

989
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,880
that meets those requirements is

990
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,240
verified

991
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,920
the second thing

992
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,240
is to verify integrity of this you know

993
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,359
external content or whatever

994
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,200
and that's something that you would only

995
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,960
do if you've already verified the

996
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,119
passport but also only do

997
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,480
if you

998
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,280
need to care about that integrity

999
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,960
uh

1000
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,920
so

1001
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,839
i think i had better words around this

1002
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,240
in the email but the general idea i

1003
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,720
think is to actually divide this up into

1004
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,160
two steps

1005
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,118
where um

1006
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,520
and the dependency is only one way right

1007
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,760
so verification of the passport itself

1008
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,480
is not it is not dependent in any way

1009
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,760
on

1010
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,920
the integrity being correct all it does

1011
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,920
is verify that hey this rcdi hash value

1012
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,000
is the value they put in

1013
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
and then you have a separate step which

1014
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,160
does depend on having a verified

1015
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,440
passport

1016
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,760
which is the integrity check itself

1017
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,680
yeah

1018
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,640
the last sentences here are trying to

1019
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,440
say

1020
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,160
roughly that then in the sense of you

1021
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,960
know

1022
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,200
because it's not about full verification

1023
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,359
versus something else right

1024
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,560
and like i i i'm a little hesitant you

1025
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,319
know to figure out how we want to draw

1026
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,520
the line on this and this is like a

1027
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,880
fundamental ambiguity and start shaking

1028
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,720
it's been around forever right of what

1029
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,079
what it really means for this thing to

1030
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,680
be verified and what you're supposed to

1031
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,800
do with that

1032
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,599
i think the interesting part of rcd is

1033
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,599
that it you know it's kind of more

1034
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,800
actionable

1035
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,960
than some of the previous ways that

1036
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,720
we've talked about verification in a

1037
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,000
pre-rcd environment where like you know

1038
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,040
it used to be it's just kind of like

1039
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,480
okay if the call is verified then it

1040
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,119
goes into carrier policy engines or

1041
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,880
people translate into veristats or

1042
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,880
whatever this more fundamental question

1043
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,000
of are these links in it going to be

1044
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,480
rendered to users are they safe to be

1045
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,960
rendered to users and to like show up on

1046
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,880
their display on their mobile device

1047
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,560
when they're being alerted

1048
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,520
um

1049
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,520
i mean we don't want to be prescriptive

1050
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,280
about that though for the same reason we

1051
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,520
don't tend to be prescriptive about what

1052
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,960
you're supposed to do when you decide

1053
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,640
something is verified

1054
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,640
so i mean um

1055
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,079
i think this

1056
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,880
in some ways this is the semantic you

1057
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,560
know question what what we consider to

1058
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,480
be verification or full verification or

1059
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,920
do we want to split it into an explicit

1060
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,119
stage one and stage two but you know i

1061
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,800
think where the difference is material

1062
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,440
is that question of are we recommending

1063
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,720
or at least are we considering these

1064
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,400
rules to be safe to render to a user a

1065
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,160
policy allows that

1066
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,560
and like that that may be a place to

1067
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,400
draw that distinction

1068
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,160
that i i at least understand what it's

1069
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,839
supposed to mean because i mean just

1070
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,280
kind of saying well we've got a couple

1071
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,160
different

1072
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,319
things that verification could mean and

1073
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,839
carriers without what you will or

1074
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:32,720
whatever

1075
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,720
um you know i i

1076
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,160
i'm not sure is appropriate for where

1077
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,040
we're going with rci

1078
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,119
yeah i i sort of yeah i think the crux

1079
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,000
of the issue for me which um or at least

1080
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,880
the part that i struggle with is

1081
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,760
um

1082
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,079
you know if i'm signing

1083
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,240
a call

1084
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,839
and i

1085
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,599
you know maybe

1086
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:00,880
my

1087
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,119
telephone number is correct but

1088
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,240
you know i send a logo that's obviously

1089
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,640
trying to scam people

1090
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,079
um is it right to look at that you know

1091
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,440
are you looking at the total picture

1092
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,280
there of

1093
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,800
verified or

1094
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,400
you know you know are you saying only

1095
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,359
um well the telephone number passes so

1096
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,240
so it's okay um that that's the part i

1097
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,160
struggle with i think if you're sending

1098
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,760
any information

1099
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,000
you have to look at it holistically but

1100
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,240
um

1101
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,480
go ahead

1102
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,200
i think ben was next

1103
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,319
so i think

1104
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,319
we're falling into semantic trap when we

1105
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,680
talk about

1106
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,960
partial verification or full

1107
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,200
verification or that sort of thing and i

1108
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,960
can understand your point about you know

1109
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,440
whether we should consider a passport to

1110
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,880
be verified

1111
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,160
if it's got obvious bad acting going on

1112
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,599
but i think those are two things that

1113
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,880
are separate i think a a evil passport

1114
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,359
that is properly signed and and hits all

1115
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,040
the jw

1116
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,839
t claim constraints isn't valid

1117
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,560
if a operator or whoever wants to make

1118
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,319
other policy decisions based on the

1119
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:13,280
contents

1120
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,200
they certainly can

1121
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,000
but

1122
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,839
and i don't think we're necessarily on

1123
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,440
different pages when it comes to we how

1124
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,680
we expect people to behave

1125
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,000
or what we expect to be allowed

1126
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,599
but i think we fall into a semantic trap

1127
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:28,880
that's that's going to really confuse

1128
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,640
people if we're not careful here and

1129
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,640
that's why i'm trying

1130
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,079
and proposing

1131
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,319
that

1132
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,319
integrity verification has is

1133
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,480
not part of passport verification at all

1134
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,040
they are two distinctly separate things

1135
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,800
what passport verification does is

1136
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,520
verify the contents of the passport

1137
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,960
and the signature

1138
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,520
etc the

1139
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,280
then what you do with the contents of

1140
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,520
the passport are up to your policy and

1141
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,200
here's this thing that you should be

1142
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,280
using if you're paying attention to this

1143
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,240
logo

1144
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,160
if you want to use this logo

1145
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,000
um

1146
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,560
but i get i guess

1147
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,240
can can i just quick comment my fear is

1148
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,800
that um

1149
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,560
people won't take the integrity stuff

1150
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,160
seriously

1151
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,359
um

1152
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:22,480
and

1153
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,520
um you'll have a mailbox that gives the

1154
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,760
shaken at a station a based on the phone

1155
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,880
number

1156
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,559
and people are going to pass risk rich

1157
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,079
call data and they're not going to check

1158
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,400
the integrity and therefore it's going

1159
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,520
to be a huge security hole because

1160
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,119
people are going to pass whatever logos

1161
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,400
they want and it's not going to get

1162
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,559
verified on the other side

1163
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,800
well

1164
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,599
if they do that then whoever is using

1165
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,440
that logo is doing it wrong

1166
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,400
and

1167
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,480
i'm already hearing use cases of people

1168
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,559
talking about this idea

1169
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,559
that

1170
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,800
the

1171
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,359
originating carrier gets the

1172
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,480
rcd passport signed by a delegate

1173
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,599
certificate

1174
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,480
and uses it only for education purposes

1175
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,839
because that's all they care about and

1176
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,319
then they pass that passport on to the

1177
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,720
terminating side and it's entirely up to

1178
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,880
the terminating side to

1179
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,680
to verify the rcd parts

1180
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,000
and that seems like a valid use case and

1181
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,960
that's

1182
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,319
the kind of thing we need to be careful

1183
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,960
not to preclude

1184
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,640
right but that's why i care about the

1185
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,559
text being

1186
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,599
more specific to verification really

1187
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,400
means both passport validation and

1188
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,760
integrity check

1189
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,240
so that i argue that i argue that does

1190
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,240
not

1191
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,119
but what what do you say to the case

1192
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,200
that i just mentioned that you ignored

1193
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,480
integrity and you know the passport

1194
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,480
gets validated fine

1195
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,160
chris if

1196
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,839
if the end entity is ignoring

1197
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,319
um integrity then you might as well give

1198
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,240
up because

1199
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,040
like the middle boxes cannot protect

1200
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,400
against a malicious actor in that

1201
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,559
position because all the malicious actor

1202
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,400
has to do is provide the right thing to

1203
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,160
those middle boxes and the malicious

1204
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,240
thing to the end entity

1205
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,720
that's easy to do so there is so

1206
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,720
essentially

1207
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,400
what i'm saying in this text that

1208
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,240
that the end entity should consider only

1209
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,040
verification if integrity and passport

1210
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,119
is uh verified

1211
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,200
but they're in there the cases that

1212
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,559
you're talking about the middle box

1213
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,240
scenarios the originating service

1214
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,359
provider

1215
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,040
you know if it all it cares about is

1216
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,720
doing shaken verification on the

1217
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,800
telephone number it could it doesn't

1218
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,160
have you know it doesn't have to check

1219
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,520
the logos it can give a attestation etc

1220
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,040
so i want to stay strong on the on the

1221
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,040
end point that needs to verify

1222
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,559
everything

1223
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,119
but recognize that there is some middle

1224
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:08,960
box scenarios where you don't have to do

1225
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,720
the full verification

1226
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,400
i think that's exactly what that text

1227
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,640
says

1228
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,400
uh

1229
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,880
yes i

1230
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,000
i think the thing is is that this doing

1231
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
the integrity verification is very

1232
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,200
important but doing it correctly is also

1233
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,040
you have to do it right

1234
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,200
and

1235
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,640
middle boxes can actively cause harm by

1236
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,319
doing integrity verification

1237
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,839
and

1238
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,000
the

1239
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,520
and

1240
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,280
i feel like frequently the verification

1241
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,960
service is not the thing that is

1242
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,960
actually rendering

1243
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,680
the things at the urls

1244
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,960
which means

1245
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,160
the

1246
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:56,880
like

1247
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,839
the integrity is quite separate and like

1248
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,480
the in my view the thing in the passport

1249
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,800
like the text of the urls is what the

1250
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,440
passport is verifying

1251
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,119
and like the contents of what you're of

1252
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,880
what's at those urls is so

1253
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,800
vague and indistinct that like the only

1254
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,240
thing that could realistically do that

1255
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,839
is the thing at the end and so it should

1256
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,040
be

1257
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,760
more explicit like that is the only

1258
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,599
thing that should be doing anything and

1259
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,119
everything else should ignore it because

1260
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,280
every like

1261
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,800
everything in the middle is going to

1262
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,000
break things

1263
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,119
if they do

1264
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,200
i'm happy to clarify that um

1265
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,960
that

1266
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,440
i mean i understand that there you know

1267
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,960
there are some cases where a terminating

1268
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,760
provider might um verify it and then

1269
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,599
convert it into something else and

1270
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,359
hopefully that is all over a secure

1271
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,920
channel there's some that were or it

1272
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,000
might just all get sent

1273
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,400
i recognize that but the verification

1274
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,520
service that

1275
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,760
like you said that's actually rendering

1276
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,079
retrieving the url

1277
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:03,680
and actually going to render it in a

1278
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,480
trusted space um

1279
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,720
because it did the entire verification

1280
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,920
that's the thing that we're talking

1281
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,839
about and maybe that's the thing i can

1282
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,079
clarify in the text so that that i don't

1283
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:15,520
disagree with

1284
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,160
so i'm trying to chair real quick uh

1285
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:18,960
since

1286
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,640
we've only got eight minutes left and

1287
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,480
another topic and we're likely to wrap

1288
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,920
on this some

1289
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,839
around the sum i'd suggest that those

1290
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:27,599
people who are caring which sounds like

1291
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,920
it's like chris and me and jack

1292
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,160
uh get together offline with some email

1293
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,119
and see if we can come up with some

1294
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,400
types we agree with and present it back

1295
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,599
to the list

1296
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,240
did anyone object to that

1297
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,919
don't we have an hour and eight minutes

1298
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,960
uh

1299
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,680
we we only have a total of an hour

1300
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,760
yeah we have a one hour slot

1301
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,359
i thought we had two okay

1302
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,920
eric

1303
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,440
uh if someone has something new to say

1304
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,440
about it

1305
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,559
eric if you have something new to say

1306
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,960
please go ahead

1307
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,319
so i was going to say that but i was

1308
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,558
wrong

1309
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,880
okay um

1310
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,359
let me check what's on my last slide i i

1311
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,760
think that's fine but we can

1312
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,760
meet offline and propose some text on

1313
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,079
the list

1314
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:40,440
okay yeah that was it anyways

1315
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,280
so hopefully we've gone through all the

1316
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,400
issues um you know um i think we've gone

1317
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,319
through it pretty exhaustively but uh if

1318
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,319
there's anything else uh we can also

1319
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,800
talk about that on the list as well

1320
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,319
but would like to start uh wrapping up

1321
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:01,280
and heading back into working group last

1322
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,680
call if possible

1323
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,839
it sounds like we should switch to

1324
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,319
messaging

1325
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,839
and chris thanks for putting up with us

1326
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,680
anytime it's a great discussion

1327
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,240
okay

1328
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,599
so

1329
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,119
uh stir messaging i'm gonna do this real

1330
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,880
quick

1331
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,920
um

1332
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,520
so there was an update to the storm

1333
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,760
messaging draft um for those of you that

1334
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,000
are just joining us on this one this is

1335
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,240
looking at providing store protection

1336
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,839
for a set of use cases for either um

1337
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:08,160
real time tech session negotiation which

1338
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,880
encompasses things like rcs as well as

1339
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,000
kind of sending individual messages why

1340
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,359
are we doing this

1341
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:16,880
because message spam is becoming a big

1342
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,599
problem and really um it seems to make

1343
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,119
little sense to develop like a separate

1344
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,240
pki um for messaging that is using

1345
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,599
telephone numbers when we've already

1346
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,680
built this stuff out for stir but this

1347
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,040
is just to be clear it's kind of

1348
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,040
speculative work in the sense that

1349
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,799
although there's some interest in

1350
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:35,440
exploring this it's not like um

1351
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,160
you know they're the the uh

1352
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,040
messaging ecosystem is incredibly

1353
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,359
um diverse and filled with lots of

1354
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,079
legacy craft that never touches sip and

1355
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,599
would be very difficult for us to

1356
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,319
arrogate to ourselves but we still think

1357
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,559
um especially given some of the fcc's

1358
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,119
recent comments about this problem that

1359
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,960
uh we should have a story for it for how

1360
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,079
it will work with stir

1361
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:01,920
um as i suggested there's kind of like

1362
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,480
two paths um you know

1363
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,720
you can obviously negotiate with sdp um

1364
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,559
any kind of media stream security that

1365
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,880
you would like using mechanisms that

1366
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,680
look a lot like our sip brandy stuff

1367
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,280
which was devised for voice but

1368
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,799
basically all the same principles would

1369
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:21,520
apply to negotiating an msrp session or

1370
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,720
something like that

1371
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,000
and then there's individual message

1372
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,720
security um brian will tell us that this

1373
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,559
is useful for some emergency services

1374
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,760
applications our proposal is basically

1375
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,000
to protect these messages at the mime

1376
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,960
level to have a message digest that will

1377
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,000
cover them

1378
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,960
and

1379
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,799
that will become part of a new message

1380
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:43,359
eye very similar to rcdi

1381
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,359
um

1382
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,520
element that will appear in passports

1383
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,599
that are of this new um message

1384
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,280
powerpoint type

1385
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,160
um

1386
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,839
we really put this as a pretty pat

1387
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:55,280
answer we're just like we're gonna do my

1388
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,960
mobile security for whatever's in the

1389
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,400
message like we're gonna protect it from

1390
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,400
my level um it's kind of kind of a bad

1391
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,040
answer but um at least thus far we

1392
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,280
haven't encountered too many roadblocks

1393
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,119
around that

1394
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,720
um

1395
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,240
so what else is new in this version we

1396
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,160
added some security and privacy

1397
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,920
considerations a lot of that just

1398
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,520
referencing the numerous other places

1399
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,440
that we have discussed this

1400
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,880
we added a little bit of text about

1401
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,119
message conferencing this is one of the

1402
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:22,559
longer polls in the tent when you look

1403
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,240
at something like msrp of course we've

1404
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,839
endlessly studied

1405
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:27,119
centralized and decentralized

1406
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,119
conferencing applications for sip

1407
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,200
we do know we'll need connected identity

1408
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,839
for that and my current proposal is

1409
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:36,000
basically to kick

1410
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,440
most of the work that would need to be

1411
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,119
done to make that

1412
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:41,200
into the connected identity draft itself

1413
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,280
as that goes forward and kind of leave

1414
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,040
this as a pretty

1415
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,160
um

1416
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,880
simple draft that just kind of provides

1417
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,640
the tools that implementers go kick

1418
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,720
around

1419
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,480
and see if it looks like it might be

1420
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,440
useful

1421
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,079
i did add some text on cpam ben you know

1422
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,839
pointed out in the list that you know

1423
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,359
there are some applications that you see

1424
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:03,520
pim in particular from metadata and that

1425
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,119
this is an area where we need to get

1426
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:07,920
some input from implementers i mean my

1427
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,920
high level intuition would be that um

1428
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,839
if we're protecting the entire mind body

1429
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:16,880
if that provided that cpim metadata

1430
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,480
is encoded as a mind body that will

1431
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,319
accompany a message

1432
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,960
then we get it for free and if it's

1433
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,839
metadata that is being protected in a

1434
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,319
message stream um we also should get it

1435
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,799
for free but i mean then is there

1436
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,520
some reason that that might not be true

1437
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,960
from what you understand of this and i

1438
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,559
know that we need to dig into this like

1439
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:37,760
before we

1440
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,960
um

1441
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,319
you know before we make a decision about

1442
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:42,400
it

1443
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,599
i don't know that i have an answer to

1444
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:46,880
that question

1445
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,200
um

1446
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,880
the only thing i comment i had is there

1447
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,040
is a discussion of this somewhat in the

1448
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,040
uh what 85 i can't remember the draft

1449
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,880
that russ and i did a while back rfc8

1450
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,640
wrestling i did a while back

1451
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,640
um yeah

1452
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,559
but

1453
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:04,480
and we do reference that in in the span

1454
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,240
right

1455
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,160
but the cpm discussion goes further than

1456
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,760
what is mentioned in in this um

1457
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,799
the big concern i have is

1458
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:16,799
that there were at least some cases

1459
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:19,760
where it appeared that uh intermediary

1460
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,440
intermediaries were adding things like

1461
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,040
time stamps and such

1462
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,520
into the cpim headers

1463
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,040
which could break integrity if we were

1464
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,359
doing the whole message

1465
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:30,720
no definitely so we have one minute left

1466
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,078
in the public agenda without echo

1467
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,480
hey john um

1468
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,079
i think this is like great to see you

1469
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,599
working on this um can you talk a little

1470
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:42,640
bit what do you think the relationship

1471
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,440
with mls is um you know obviously on you

1472
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,480
know these these are all in the same

1473
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,680
space and which might be nice if there

1474
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,040
was a way if like if you know there

1475
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,559
wasn't a break point between like you

1476
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,760
know sms or sms style stuff and um and

1477
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,000
others investing applications

1478
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,920
yeah i mean i think i hope we could

1479
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,760
largely get mls for free as well in the

1480
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,520
sense of this is just telling you use

1481
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,160
store credentials right like you used to

1482
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,640
search as your trust anchors for like

1483
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,839
mls right and like but i mean we we

1484
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,520
actually we had a few discussions about

1485
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,520
this earlier and there wasn't there were

1486
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,599
a lot of takers in this room on that but

1487
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,680
if you have some thoughts on that love

1488
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,160
to discuss happy to put some text in you

1489
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,760
know i i don't think that that expertise

1490
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,359
is in this room to ascertain like what

1491
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:25,200
the interaction is with mls

1492
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,720
um

1493
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,160
maybe you're like oh let me read the

1494
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,200
draft to me you know i can circle back

1495
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,640
later or bring richard in as a

1496
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,760
possibility because i think like you

1497
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,400
know

1498
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,680
because it will be good to like like

1499
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,440
future proof this a little bit for that

1500
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,280
thank you yeah

1501
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,799
ryan

1502
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:41,040
uh this clearly would be useful to us in

1503
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,240
emergencies we treat

1504
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,520
msrp is what we actually use

1505
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,599
and it's treated like a call and has all

1506
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:50,960
the same spam

1507
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,480
and

1508
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,280
swatting issues that we have with calls

1509
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,960
and if we lock down

1510
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,200
if we lock down calls and we don't lock

1511
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,280
down messages that's just a vector for

1512
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,440
people to exploit so we'd really like to

1513
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,480
have this

1514
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,000
we do use msrp and we gateway

1515
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,880
sms to msrp that's been done for quite a

1516
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,079
while now

1517
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:13,680
um

1518
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,880
so

1519
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,960
msrp would work for us as long as we can

1520
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,079
you know

1521
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:22,480
effectively get the right thing to

1522
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,000
happen on the other end at the gateway

1523
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,640
with sms and that's a that's a signaling

1524
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,559
problem right that's ss7 and all that

1525
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,680
mess but but with respect to sip

1526
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,960
uh if it's sip all the way we're we're

1527
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,960
okay with this this would be really

1528
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,680
useful to us

1529
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,640
cool

1530
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,160
chris

1531
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,040
i was just going to say

1532
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,680
gatewaying to msrp is what happens in

1533
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,839
the rcs world too so

1534
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:53,680
yeah it wouldn't be too different

1535
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,200
uh ben also raised on the list the

1536
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,319
question a question about store and

1537
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:58,160
forward especially for the message side

1538
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,240
of this um which raises a lot of

1539
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,680
familiar semantic questions about what

1540
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,920
means to be for a message be delivered

1541
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,000
in intermediate like texting system like

1542
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
this as opposed to red

1543
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,839
um certainly we can discuss that more

1544
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,440
we're now over time

1545
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,559
um

1546
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,000
but i mean one of the main things i

1547
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,559
wanted to get from people here is if

1548
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:18,559
people are cool with us punting largely

1549
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:20,400
unconferencing i think it's worth just

1550
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,680
having the basic tools out there from

1551
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,839
predators to play with and figuring out

1552
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:26,480
multi-party messaging later

1553
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,079
does anybody think that's unacceptable

1554
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:29,280
that we actually need to solve

1555
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,039
multi-party messaging like out of the

1556
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,760
gate for this to be useful

1557
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,039
well but if we were to do them all

1558
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:41,280
spread you could mostly for free

1559
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,280
um oh that'd be nice

1560
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,119
i mean not tired necessarily but like

1561
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,440
people someone for free um yeah like i

1562
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,880
said let's circle about this a little

1563
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,480
bit once once i tend to like really

1564
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,079
assimilate the draft and i think also

1565
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:53,440
this sort of like this overall

1566
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,960
communication model obviously as a

1567
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,240
question

1568
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,559
yeah it wouldn't be a problem for for

1569
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,200
emergency services that's done inside

1570
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,079
um and the the user although might be

1571
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,079
aware of multi-party

1572
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:07,680
from its point of view it's just it's a

1573
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,280
unicast

1574
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:14,319
line going out that has stuff done to it

1575
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:16,079
that's probably not stable for a very

1576
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:18,400
long time that is where we are now um

1577
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,319
because nobody implements multi-party

1578
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,640
msrp in any particularly great way right

1579
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:23,359
now

1580
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:25,280
um if that happened

1581
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,720
so that you know

1582
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,760
we started doing chat with msrp

1583
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,599
in in

1584
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,000
deployed systems then then our opinion

1585
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,240
would change but right now it's not a

1586
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,400
big deal and punting it is fine

1587
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,760
yeah i mean anything uses centralized

1588
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,440
conferencing that can actually proxy

1589
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,119
through a passport and the passport will

1590
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,880
still validate on the other side of it i

1591
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,799
think we'll be fine it's just a question

1592
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:48,799
of anything that has to munch

1593
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:50,559
that i'm worried about and like whether

1594
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:52,079
your desk needs to contain your total

1595
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,760
targets at the start or whether you know

1596
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,440
those are the things there's actually

1597
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,880
some considerations i did put in this

1598
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,039
draft about that point in particular

1599
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,520
um okay great

1600
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,839
yeah john and i talked about this but i

1601
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,319
think it's probably better i think it's

1602
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:08,720
something we can do and probably can do

1603
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,280
sooner rather than later but i think

1604
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,079
just from the industry swallowing things

1605
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,079
it might be good just for this document

1606
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:17,280
to keep it

1607
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,039
simple and then maybe have something

1608
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:21,520
separate that considers conferencing

1609
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,680
scenarios more generally

1610
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,839
and maybe mls is another case to

1611
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:27,280
consider

1612
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,200
um that could be part of that whole

1613
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,319
framework also

1614
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,559
cool we are out of time

1615
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:39,520
we are out of time um i think we're you

1616
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,119
know again if we're not going to do any

1617
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:43,280
major surgery and mls you know hopefully

1618
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,799
wouldn't be major surgery i think we're

1619
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,319
pretty close to working good last call

1620
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:48,079
here why don't i circle around with

1621
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:49,839
richard which i was seeing you in in the

1622
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:51,680
text there in the chat

1623
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,160
um and echo a bit on what we might want

1624
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,880
to do to just uh at least draw a line

1625
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,400
for this is this would be the basic

1626
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,839
principles you're going to use mls with

1627
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:02,078
this

1628
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:05,280
but you know to ben's point in the chat

1629
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,119
and what i said earlier this is getting

1630
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:08,319
some attention at the moment like the

1631
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:10,960
fcc is turning their baleful gaze to

1632
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,039
messaging because the problem is

1633
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:15,280
becoming um quite quite a bit worse in

1634
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,760
the u.s at the moment and again i i

1635
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,359
would just hate to see somebody try to

1636
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,200
completely reinvent the wheel around

1637
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,880
this for a telephone number based you

1638
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,280
know messaging when we have the star

1639
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,000
shaken pki like now not just you know

1640
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,960
widely deployed but like in constant use

1641
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,760
for telephone calls the moment so

1642
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,640
and with that i will be done

1643
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,760
thank you john and thank you everyone

1644
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,000
for your time and attendance today

1645
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,359
and uh

1646
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:47,359
we'll be getting back together soon i

1647
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:50,079
imagine

1648
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,400
you

1649
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,440
take care
