1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,759
so

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,759
it's time to start but

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,800
i don't see overall yet so i'm going to

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,480
wait another minute or so

5
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,000
or maybe not

6
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,840
i just got advice to just go ahead so

7
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,719
that's what we'll do

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,320
so uh

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,399
welcome to this

10
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,199
monday meeting in the very last

11
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,120
time slot of itf

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,120
112.

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,840
this is actually the second episode of

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,720
the

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,920
don and ron show

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,439
my co-chair don fedec

17
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,720
is

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,200
here to

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
help me

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,720
bring this to a

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,080
somewhat successful end

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,080
um

23
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,320
there's a high probability that you have

24
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,680
seen the model before this week

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,479
but

26
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,640
it's still important

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,920
so uh so pay attention to it

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,040
and

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,960
we've been asked and you probably also

30
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,360
heard this to uh

31
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,399
to

32
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,040
especially point out the code of context

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,680
and the anti-harassment

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,960
rules

35
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,960
don't do you want to say something about

36
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,399
those

37
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,960
no that was it i mean like

38
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,920
unless anybody has a question but

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,038
you should have seen this by now yeah

40
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,800
and uh i'm happy to say that uh

41
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,920
i haven't seen any uh real bad behavior

42
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,480
in the money working group for uh quite

43
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,480
a number of years so uh

44
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,440
keep it that way and we won't have any

45
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,160
of this trouble

46
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,400
okay this is uh some standard stuff

47
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,560
which you also should have experienced

48
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,720
by now

49
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,720
[Music]

50
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
we have a money working group

51
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,879
we have a general monet mailing list

52
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,879
we have

53
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,120
a list specifically for reaching the

54
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,599
tiers

55
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,040
overall ratana is our responsible id

56
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,840
and we have an agenda for this meeting

57
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,879
not all you've seen

58
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,920
we can

59
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,680
bash the agenda if somebody wants to

60
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,920
change anything

61
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,480
and we would like to

62
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,440
have some people use the headstock tool

63
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,720
to keep some notes

64
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,000
next up will be the

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,840
draft status for uh working group

66
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,239
documents

67
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,599
we have uh

68
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,959
um

69
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,959
the item that

70
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,480
we put on the agenda after some

71
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,319
hesitation because it's really something

72
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,360
that we

73
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,319
should resolve over the mailing list but

74
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,080
while we're here

75
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,879
we may spend a couple of minutes

76
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,280
on this

77
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,879
then we go to

78
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,200
one draft that's still in the working

79
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
group that should be

80
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,239
ready

81
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,720
for working group last call unless

82
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,439
somebody has

83
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,080
serious objections

84
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,120
there are

85
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,799
a couple of individual drafts by henning

86
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,160
henningrova who's probably not here

87
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,320
but

88
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,519
we have something to say about

89
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,360
those and

90
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,639
then there's

91
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,720
a very brief revisit of the

92
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,880
future work

93
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,560
agenda item

94
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,479
which we

95
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,039
went into

96
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,560
more extensively in the in itf 111

97
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,160
and then

98
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,759
i'm very glad

99
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,919
to be able to announce that

100
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,599
ed bering has agreed to

101
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,440
present

102
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,160
what's now known as the dti network

103
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,840
management

104
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,520
framework or

105
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,159
architecture

106
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,080
formerly known as asynchronous

107
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,919
management architecture

108
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,160
and now the new name suggests that this

109
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,360
this is purely for dtn

110
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,680
but i hope that in this presentation it

111
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,280
will become clear

112
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,960
why this might also be relevant

113
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,080
for

114
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,360
our working group and how it might

115
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,520
help us deal with one of our charter

116
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,840
items

117
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,919
there are these three internet drafts

118
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,120
which are

119
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,800
centered around

120
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,160
flow control and specifically

121
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,800
diff serverware credit based flow

122
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,479
control

123
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,400
they have been in the

124
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,160
working group for a very long time they

125
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,320
went through a very long uh working

126
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,479
group last call

127
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,560
not because there were so

128
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,479
many comments but because there were so

129
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,319
few

130
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,080
um

131
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,800
[Music]

132
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,440
they have now left the working group

133
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,720
and they are under a transporter area

134
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,880
they're on a review of the early review

135
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,360
of the transport area

136
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,919
a refuel team

137
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,199
specifically

138
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,199
the review will be done by david black

139
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,120
and

140
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,560
we requested

141
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,680
an end date of november 30th

142
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,000
but he has indicated that he may overrun

143
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,360
that with a couple of days but

144
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,400
um

145
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,319
i don't know whether this will lead to

146
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,160
extreme frustration

147
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,639
with the authors but

148
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,520
yeah given the long history

149
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,599
i would be inclined to think

150
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,479
what difference do a couple of days make

151
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,639
so hopefully

152
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,280
somewhere in early december we have the

153
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,759
feedback from david

154
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,840
we

155
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,479
will that

156
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,039
swiftly i hope

157
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,919
then i am

158
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,400
the idea is that

159
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,840
i would become a document

160
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,000
shepard only s they're somebody who's

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,160
very keen on

162
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,560
all taking that role

163
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,160
i've never done it before but

164
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,919
i'm

165
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,199
prepared to do it unless

166
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,000
as

167
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,639
it has always been somebody's dream to

168
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,039
do this

169
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,639
let's see if there's anything in the

170
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,639


171
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,879
then um there's there's one uh remaining

172
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,639
uh

173
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,240
draft in the working group which is

174
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,960
really uh belongs to the same

175
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,720
group of

176
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,479
credit based flow control

177
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,800
extensions but one that uses the 82.1 q

178
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,599
header as a

179
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,680
as a distinguishing factor for for flows

180
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,879
instead of dhcp like in a da credit

181
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,599
for some unclear reason this one has

182
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,878
gotten behind the other ones

183
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,680
it's also dependent on on the traffic

184
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,680
classification and the

185
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,919
general credit flow control

186
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,000
documents

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,880
so um

188
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,360
the idea is to have a

189
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,839
let's say

190
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,800
two weeks

191
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,200
yeah maybe three weeks

192
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,360
working group last call

193
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,680
um

194
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,680
and then

195
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,760
send it running behind

196
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
the other documents that we have sent to

197
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,839
the

198
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,440
transport area refuel team

199
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,959
and then um

200
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,279
now i have already covered uh agenda

201
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,600
item four uh practically

202
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,920
and on agenda item five is a discussion

203
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,399
of these uh uh currently individual

204
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,760
drafts by ending

205
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,360
on a fiscal layer

206
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,320
developer extensions

207
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,480
so to this

208
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,880
rada resolution there was a

209
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,959
rather filed by rick taylor at the

210
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,880
beginning of this year

211
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,839
because

212
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,080
there was something in the in

213
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,600
rc 81

214
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,360
75

215
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,000
the main d-lab specification

216
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
where

217
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,040
it said that

218
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,279
when a discovery signal

219
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,640
was answered

220
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,360
by a modem

221
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,040
vip

222
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,120
addresses source and destination should

223
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,040
be swapped

224
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,680
um unfortunately

225
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,720
for sending back the uh

226
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
the reply the acceptance

227
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,959
uh unfortunately this destination

228
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,920
address was a multicast address

229
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,720
so it wouldn't quite work

230
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,800
um

231
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,279
we have been trying to come up with a

232
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,120
better wording

233
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,800
um

234
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,720
at some point uh

235
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,959
that kept stalled

236
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,320
our id

237
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,480
marked uh

238
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,160
recognized the problem

239
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,360
but marked the uh

240
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
the rather before uh

241
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,880
as held for document update

242
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,560
but now it's apparently been reopened

243
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,959
and um

244
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,680
recently uh brian citrus

245
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,680
said yeah wait a minute but there's also

246
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,640
something

247
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,920
about the

248
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,760
udp port numbers um

249
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,519
they should also be a visual

250
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,040
but we were already trying to

251
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,480
take care of that

252
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,959
while we were trying to address

253
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,920
ratham 6472

254
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,000
so

255
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,160
rick came up with some words

256
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,360
overall came with up with some words and

257
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,480
so did i

258
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,440
but we never completely resolved it

259
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,839
but i think we should we should just try

260
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:30,959
harder

261
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,720
because

262
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,440
it should be possible to

263
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,480
have some

264
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,120
ambiguous effects there really

265
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,320
if somebody wants to help uh welcome

266
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,399
if not then i'm going to propose

267
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,800
something on the mailing list

268
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,120
uh i had hoped to do that before this

269
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,880
meeting but i did not get around to it

270
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,040
so

271
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,959
that's uh

272
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,399
one of

273
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,079
a number of apologies that i have to

274
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,399
make

275
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,839
this is basically what i just said

276
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,360
um

277
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,880
oh

278
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,360
go ahead

279
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,600
um thanks ronald so i was going to put

280
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,440
my name forward i have some time in the

281
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,480
next two weeks to work on that errata

282
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,120
just in a very quick summary

283
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,320
the text as it currently stands is

284
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,880
half wrong and half misleading when

285
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,120
talking about replying to a dis to the

286
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,519
multicast discovery packet

287
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,240
the

288
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,800
not only is the response ip address

289
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
incorrect but also there's no mention of

290
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,040
what to do with the udp port the fix

291
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,120
should be very simple it's just a matter

292
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,720
of wordsmithing and we should be able to

293
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,040
close off all three of those errata one

294
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,200
of them i think might be a duplicate but

295
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,800
we should be able to fix it

296
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,639
i'll put my name forwards i've got some

297
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,680
time uh starting from tuesday next week

298
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,560
uh to certainly work on that so i'll

299
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,518
i'll make that commitment

300
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,560
and with

301
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,600
with words that are also

302
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
that are misleading

303
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,240
comprehensible to

304
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,279
us english speakers

305
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,279
okay i might even include a diagram

306
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,000
yeah but you uh you said uh sometime

307
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,360
back that we couldn't use the

308
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,040
construction neither nor or neither nor

309
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,880
that was to do with the dtn charter but

310
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,079
yeah okay

311
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,800
now that was to do with this

312
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,440
oh okay fine i i like my double my

313
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,800
double negatives

314
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,399
yeah okay

315
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,519
okay

316
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,160
uh yeah glad to help by the way and

317
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,480
thank you

318
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,720
um

319
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,800
overall

320
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,920
uh thanks ronald so so really quick um

321
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,160
yeah i

322
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,800
marked those two routers from brian as

323
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,760
duplicates and uh he uh explained to me

324
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,959
what i missed

325
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,600
uh so i already asked the rc editor to

326
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,480
reopen 64

327
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,120
yeah i know what we're going to do is

328
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,800
i'm going to add there the extra detail

329
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,320
about the udp port

330
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,000
um so just so you guys know health for

331
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,760
document update means this is a valid

332
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,519
errata you know we just didn't agree on

333
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,639
the exact text right

334
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,600
for me to market verified

335
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,680
we need something that will actually

336
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,279
show up

337
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,240
as the actual text so now in the tools

338
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,279
you can go look at the

339
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,560
the router which will actually show up

340
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,880
uh in the document when you see it right

341
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,760
so if

342
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,120
we want that you know that's perfect

343
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,600
i'll just keep this open until we agree

344
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,279
on on text

345
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,279
that again when you go see it it'll show

346
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,720
the new text

347
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,480
instead of of the old one so so that

348
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,639
would be great if if you ever agrees on

349
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,920
on the specific board that rick is going

350
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,800
to work on so again 6472 is the one

351
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,240
we're going to work on

352
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,040
and

353
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,880
he'll have all the details from what

354
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,079
brian added and the original stuff from

355
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:14,880
rick

356
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,199
thanks

357
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,560
thank you

358
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,760
yes that

359
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,560
clarifies it

360
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,920
and indeed my aim is to come up with

361
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,600
some some good

362
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,120
replacement text

363
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,440
so that people that are consulting 8175

364
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,519
have a possibility to

365
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,880
to see how

366
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,600
how this actually should be implemented

367
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,399
and i think that should be possible

368
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,600
that's a goal that we should set

369
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,000
ourselves

370
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,880
oh rick's back in the queue

371
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,079
oh

372
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,120
just a very quick comment from me um

373
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,959
interestingly all the implementations

374
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,079
i've seen actually do it right so

375
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,519
the intention is obviously fairly

376
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,600
obvious to a developer who reads it who

377
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,519
who says oh well you know obviously you

378
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,920
mean me to reply here but uh obviously

379
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,360
the wording has to be right but the good

380
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,720
news is i don't think this is going to

381
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,040
break loads of implementations from the

382
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,800
ones i've seen anyway

383
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,519
no no but

384
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,279
anything we can do to avoid the

385
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,439
confusion is worth it i think

386
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,440
uh okay i'm going to skip this because i

387
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,839
just said that

388
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:34,959
unless

389
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,560
somebody now

390
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,480
jumps up

391
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,480
to this virtual floor microphone

392
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,600
and say yeah no no no

393
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,279
so then i'll take it

394
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,199
i'll start a regular group last call

395
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,720
on the mailing list and then you have an

396
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,240
opportunity to still raise any

397
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,160
issues that you see with this

398
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,159
document

399
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,679
then there are the

400
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,720
physical layer related

401
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,959
delay extensions written by enemy rohan

402
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,799
that's my second apology

403
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,799
to running out henning rojo although

404
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,880
he's not here i should have followed

405
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,280
followed up

406
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,200
more

407
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,840
after a previous itf

408
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,039
he has

409
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,799
updated two of the

410
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,360
three drafts

411
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,160
and he has

412
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,600
responded to my review comments

413
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,400
i made just before itf

414
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,039
111

415
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,880
and somehow i managed to uh to miss

416
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,320
his comments to the melodies uh

417
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,799
and this was mainly about the rationale

418
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,919
for

419
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,480
providing

420
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,919
role parameters like

421
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,080
busy time rx time dx time

422
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,160
to the router and

423
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,480
this is about the general utilization

424
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,280
draft by the way

425
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,080
instead of

426
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,280
having the

427
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,200
modem provide a single

428
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,000
value for general utilization

429
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and

430
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,480
he has argued that there is benefit

431
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,679
of having the raw parameters provided

432
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,520
to the router

433
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
i'm not fully convinced but this is a

434
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,880
discussion that we really should

435
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,880
continue on the mailing list then i i

436
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,559
should have done that but

437
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,280
having said that

438
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,520
it shouldn't be only my opinion so if

439
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,440
other people can contribute there that

440
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,320
would be

441
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,280
would be

442
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,760
highly appreciated

443
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,200
the radio band the

444
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,919
d-web extension

445
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,220
is currently expired but can easily be

446
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,840
[Music]

447
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,799
revived i think

448
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,639
it's it's very short and simple

449
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,799
i'm going to ask kenny to do that and i

450
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,039
am inclined to put that dollar warning

451
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,080
for working group adoption

452
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,000
because

453
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,840
i do see some benefits

454
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
to having this information about

455
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,399
frequency and bandwidth myself

456
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,200
[Music]

457
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,440
so

458
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,000
i will issue an adoption call

459
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,799
and

460
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,960
if people like objections they can

461
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,840
respond to that

462
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,640
and then there's the radio quality one

463
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,799
and i think even

464
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,520
henning himself has some

465
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,280
doubts about the way that the

466
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,559
information is is

467
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,879
is to be presented to the router

468
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,799
so

469
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,559
yeah

470
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,400
i

471
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,000
i will probably

472
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,080
also start a discussion on that one on

473
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,600
the mailing list and then hopefully uh

474
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
those interests

475
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,159
can uh can contribute i know that uh for

476
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,400
instance rick taylor has uh has already

477
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,080
gone have provided some coins

478
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,240
back when they were first published

479
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,080
their first version

480
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,879
early in the year

481
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,520
but

482
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,480
i think we should uh

483
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,360
or i should follow up on this

484
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,200
then

485
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,120
i come to the last of my

486
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,000
chair slides

487
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,840
so we're a bit ahead on the agenda

488
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,400
possibly

489
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,520
which is good because that would mean

490
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,679
that after

491
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,200
ed's presentation

492
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,199
will be some time for discussion

493
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,400
so

494
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,320
future work

495
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,000
um

496
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,320
there was uh some

497
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,799
we have lou in the quick queue oh

498
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,840
go ahead who i i'm happy to wait to the

499
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,480
end of the slide

500
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,799
oh i didn't mean to interrupt you i was

501
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,159
just getting queued for the end of the

502
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,280
slide

503
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
so it was for this this slide but not

504
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,039
for the previous one

505
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,480
that's right okay good

506
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,840
um

507
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,679
during an inter-ability uh event

508
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,520
in june

509
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,720
where i was part and heading as well

510
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,440
some problem was discovered

511
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,240
with

512
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,000
olizar v2

513
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,360
routers restarting and then

514
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,918
making a

515
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,039
an lucky pick of some uh

516
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,720
random

517
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,760
some sequence number values that were uh

518
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,000
supposed to be uh

519
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,120
random

520
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,840
uh not the same every time that the

521
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,600
starts

522
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,240
and leading to a problem that

523
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,480
that

524
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,960
topology control information from that

525
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,600
router was no longer accepted by uh by

526
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,919
its neighbors

527
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,799
there was some discussion um

528
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,159
on the list

529
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,280
back in july which brought in uh

530
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,880
christopher dierloff one of the main

531
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,440
authors of philosophy too

532
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,640
he is retired but

533
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,600
was interested in helping out

534
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,000
if we

535
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,840
were to

536
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,679
write an informational

537
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,000
rfc because the idea is that this can be

538
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,039
fixed

539
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,280
without making any actual changes to the

540
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,200
protocol but just

541
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,679
by some

542
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,720
smarter configuration

543
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,570
so

544
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,559
[Music]

545
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,440
this

546
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,400
would probably have to be altered by

547
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,840
chris of

548
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,600
henning and whoever else feels confident

549
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,000
to help

550
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,480
so i will bring that up on the mailing

551
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,240
list

552
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,120
then there was a presentation at the idf

553
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,080
110

554
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,400
about

555
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,200
the necessity or the

556
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,919
the benefits of having a d-lab

557
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,200
clarifications and lessons learned id

558
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,840
and there was some discussion after that

559
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,600
in which we were actually determining

560
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,360
that this should be standard strike

561
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,279
this presentation in itf 1010 was made

562
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,880
by lou and rick

563
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,960
and

564
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
they are both very busy

565
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,200
they simply don't have the cycles to

566
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,880
start this off

567
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,440
so um

568
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,960
again the question to uh other working

569
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,400
group participants

570
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,760
if anybody

571
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,919
would be interested in working on this

572
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,279
don't have to

573
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,480
step up right now

574
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,760
express your interest

575
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,559
on the mailing list

576
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,639
last time we

577
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,600
talked about the fact that there was no

578
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,880
ongoing work on some other uh charter

579
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,799
items not related to dlab

580
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,480
one of those is multicast and

581
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,559
the

582
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,120
the plan to produce a multicast

583
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,000
forwarding information base

584
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,360
um

585
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,880
and

586
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,360
rick taylor

587
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,039
came to the microphone

588
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,520
i said yes well

589
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,880
there are

590
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,120
a lot of uh vendor-specific proprietary

591
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,360
multi-cut solutions in manage out there

592
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,960
and

593
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,279
maybe

594
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,240
there's really nothing to do anymore for

595
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,279
the money working group

596
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,919
i've since come

597
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,360
across one of

598
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,919
one example of such a a vendor solution

599
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,760
or as a step

600
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,600
a different uh

601
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,919
i would say yeah it is

602
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,159
it is a standard of sorts

603
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,120
but not an idf standard

604
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,600
where this is

605
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,679
dealt with below

606
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,400
the ip layer below the network layer

607
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,039
using some cooperative broadcasting

608
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,559
technique

609
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,240
and there may be others out there

610
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,200
um however i'm returning to this

611
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,200
in the next

612
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,520
major bullet

613
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,600
on non-character items

614
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,760
the other character item is his

615
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,440
management and

616
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,320
there

617
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,440
i hope we can draw inspiration from the

618
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,799
presentation that it's

619
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,720
about to

620
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,200
to give

621
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,480
uh my personal uh uh

622
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,640
uh

623
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,159
pet subject and also something i uh i

624
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,640
work on in uh in my day job is a

625
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,279
federation of heterogeneous methods

626
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,559
manage

627
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,360
what if you have

628
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,760
monets

629
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,120
which have

630
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,600
possibly also proprietary routing

631
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,760
protocols

632
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,600
all different

633
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,879
and they have to work together

634
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,279
imagine some disaster relief operation

635
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,760
where different agencies are coming

636
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,760
together each with their own equipment

637
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,480
and

638
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,080
their own uh

639
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,279
uh

640
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,679
metal routing protocols and you want to

641
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,120
connect them together

642
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,600
one way to do that would be to

643
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,640
to have some routing overlay protocol

644
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,320
that they could all speak and then they

645
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,279
could connect with each other and

646
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,279
that

647
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,760
could cover a unicost as well as

648
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,360
multi-cost and then we are back to

649
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,720
multicast

650
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,600
um even though the individual adult

651
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,919
networks may have their proprietary

652
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,559
multicast solutions

653
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,600
they would fail to communicate if

654
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,200
if there is no

655
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,399
no way to

656
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,640
make this talk to each other

657
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,640
or exchange multi-constructing

658
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,760
information in some form

659
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,679
so maybe there is something there after

660
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,840
all

661
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,360
and that's it lou

662
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,120
go ahead hi yeah sorry about jumping in

663
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,159
earlier i thought you weren't going to

664
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,440
go through the detail i thought you're

665
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,440
just going to flip to the next slide so

666
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,760
um on the routing overlay i think there

667
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,360
might be some interesting overlap with

668
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,200
the raw working group

669
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,000
because if you have uh i mean they're

670
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,480
they're focused on the deterministic

671
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,640
service but they have to solve the same

672
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,159
routing overlay where if you have

673
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,200
multiple

674
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,080
uh

675
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,600
radio networks

676
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,520
and you want to provide deterministic

677
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,039
service across them i think you have to

678
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,640
start first solve this routing overlay

679
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,960
problem

680
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,080
ah interesting

681
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,230
and um

682
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,760
[Music]

683
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,640
is the raw working group

684
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,200
uh writing up something about that or

685
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,000
yeah

686
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,320
there's an architecture document on it

687
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,919
um the

688
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,080
i think the architecture document has a

689
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,159
lot of room for improvements there's

690
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,720
some discussion about starting up

691
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,200
weekly or semi-weekly calls on the

692
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,279
architecture so

693
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,000
if i stay tuned to the list for that

694
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
list the raw working group list

695
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,760
probably good to join in there into that

696
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,360
discussion

697
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,840
okay

698
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,679
thank you

699
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:44,480
yeah

700
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,840
thank you

701
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,559
i am subscribed to that list by the way

702
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,919
but

703
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,320
maybe also a suggestion for others who

704
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,880
are interested

705
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,919
in this

706
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,840
uh rick

707
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,840
i i'm just gonna add my plus one to lose

708
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,760
comment i'm i'm one of the co-chairs of

709
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,480
raw and uh there is a bit of overlap

710
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,399
with manet i mean we're looking at

711
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,399
reusing d-let within raw

712
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,880
so yeah the federation of heterogeneous

713
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,360
radio networks is very much

714
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,600
part of what we're trying to handle in

715
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,480
raw

716
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,320
looking at the from a deterministic

717
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,559
perspective but

718
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,320
i think there's applicability to man a

719
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,200
and we are really trying to increase the

720
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,120
um

721
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,880
the round trip time in terms of

722
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,960
generating the documents uh for the for

723
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,559
the core frameworks and architectures so

724
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,919
we're trying to hold some some

725
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,600
semi-formal interims to really try and

726
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,919
make progress so i suggest people add

727
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,000
comments to the raw list as well there's

728
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,840
some crossover i'm just kind of

729
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,200
publicizing raw now so uh i'll

730
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,919
i

731
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,679
i guess you mean decrease it around

732
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,039
return instead of increase

733
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,240
yes yes of course

734
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,000
okay

735
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,880
i'll do this alone

736
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,840
go ahead please

737
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,320
uh regarding the over uh

738
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,679
the throating of relieving role usually

739
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,720
they have uh different uh

740
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,480
use case than uh many so uh it's it's

741
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,440
interesting to check to see if it's

742
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,519
applicable this uh

743
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,360
their solution to our

744
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,440
our scenario is the same

745
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,000
so it will be because uh actually as you

746
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,880
said in heterogeneous uh

747
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,519
networking or in the disaster we have

748
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,120
the the royal

749
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,440
nodes and also the many

750
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,320
moving around so both of them

751
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,120
are uh are important to have this let's

752
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,240
say

753
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,440
rooting for

754
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,480
overlay

755
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,679
using both uh networks is important as a

756
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,519
heterogeneous sensors but

757
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,760
still that there are some things to be

758
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,120
added many is different than lln

759
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,200
uh this is my opinion thank you

760
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,440
yes

761
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,840
my my thinking is that if there's a

762
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,600
solution that works for

763
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,279
for a role

764
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,440
with

765
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,360
with the required determinism then it

766
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,200
will also work for

767
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,320
manaes

768
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,159
probably

769
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,200
but not the other way around

770
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,480
anyway

771
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,600
it's

772
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,760
it's good for

773
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,240
at least a number of people in the money

774
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,840
working group to be aware but what's

775
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,559
what's developing in enroll in this

776
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,120
extent so uh

777
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,840
i encourage people to uh to follow that

778
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,799
and with that

779
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,600
i think

780
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,480
i

781
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,840
it's

782
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,399
hey how are you can you hear me

783
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,080
i can hear you

784
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,039
uh

785
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,279
i can see you although you seem to be

786
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,120
very far away

787
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,679
yes yes the signal propagation is a bit

788
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,399
longer because i'm representing dtn

789
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,559
okay

790
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,240
um

791
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,960
the virtual floor is yours

792
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,559
thank you and and thank you for

793
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,440
presenting uh the slides uh for me so

794
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,039
the um

795
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,000
i i wanted to take just uh 20 minutes or

796
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,919
so and thank you so much for for giving

797
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,880
me this opportunity uh to talk about how

798
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,440
we are uh trying to deal with the

799
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,960
problem and the question of network

800
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,440
management in in dtn's

801
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,600
there are an awful lot of slides in this

802
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,720
particular slide deck this was a larger

803
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,640
presentation what i what i would like to

804
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,440
do is try and go over roughly the first

805
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,600
10 to 12 of those to talk about the

806
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
problem at large and then for those who

807
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,320
are interested the material is posted in

808
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,239
in terms of a backup material and

809
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,159
additional information and i of course

810
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,918
would be more than happy to talk at

811
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,480
length about this with anyone who is is

812
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,520
interested

813
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,960
uh if we go to the next slide

814
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,879
we started looking at this problem

815
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,199
really uh quite a long time ago uh we

816
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,599
did some early publication uh and and

817
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,760
research associated with what makes

818
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,719
managing dtn's different

819
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,079
we looked at

820
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,000
just generally what are the components

821
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,079
of a management architecture we looked

822
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,320
at whether delays versus disruptions

823
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,960
were the driving uh features we tried to

824
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,000
understand

825
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,960
what sort of

826
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,679
infrastructure infrastructure

827
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,440
information was helpful

828
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,399
and what we drove to was the the concept

829
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,839
of end-to-end closed-loop

830
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,800
uh control over systems in a delayed and

831
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,640
disrupted environment is not going to

832
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,560
get us what we need and and that maybe

833
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,200
seems like an obvious observation uh to

834
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,400
make now

835
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,640
but at the time there was a lot of

836
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,119
energy going into trying to make

837
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,200
networks not be disrupted in the first

838
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,720
place so that you didn't have to deal

839
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,440
with that problem if we accept that we

840
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,520
needed more open loop control and if we

841
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,680
accepted that we had to have local

842
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,240
autonomy and sort of a local management

843
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,320
function separate from a remote

844
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,440
management function then it changed the

845
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,800
tech transfer

846
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,320
opportunities and it changed where we

847
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,480
looked for solutions so then we started

848
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,320
looking at autonomous fault protection

849
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,520
schemes mobile code scripting we looked

850
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,599
a lot at spacecraft because they were

851
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,440
dealing with this problem sooner than

852
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,720
others

853
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,480
and we originally put this together as

854
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,760
something called the delay tolerant

855
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,640
network management protocol uh it was a

856
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,040
product of the research group uh it was

857
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,960
a utility also being looked at and

858
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,280
implemented by nasa uh when it moved

859
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,960
into the dtm working group it was

860
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,839
returned asynchronous management to

861
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,480
refer to the asynchronous nature

862
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,520
of um of the transport not necessarily

863
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,720
the asynchronous nature of the um the

864
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,760
management applications themselves

865
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,960
if we go to the next slide

866
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,880
uh when we started looking at this in

867
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,520
terms of synchronous versus asynchronous

868
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,280
particularly from a transport

869
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,200
perspective we looked at some of the

870
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,720
obvious things at the time simple

871
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,520
network management protocol netconf

872
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,960
there was an armand mib at the time and

873
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,720
those are things that we know are pull

874
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,680
based and session based and don't work

875
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,000
in the kinds of transport environments

876
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,480
uh where we would otherwise uh you know

877
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,960
see bundle protocol uh you know bundle

878
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,480
protocol version six at the time in

879
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,440
version seven now being deployed but the

880
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,520
observation here is that and this is the

881
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,680
work being undertaken in the dtn working

882
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,599
group um is that there are new

883
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,680
capabilities coming out of the ops area

884
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,160
rest comp uh updates to yang yang push

885
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,280
and and and more uh and these have added

886
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,400
a kind of a synchronous operation where

887
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,320
applications can

888
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,720
agents can choose to more intelligently

889
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,599
push data but it still doesn't solve for

890
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,000
us the fundamental asynchronousness of

891
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,560
the underlying transport protocol and

892
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,040
how that drives us to more autonomy on

893
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,680
the local node other than only filtering

894
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,119
autonomy

895
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,240
so if we go to the next slide

896
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,000
so if we if we zoom all the way back and

897
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,599
say what does this look like in a very

898
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,760
very scaled environment

899
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,160
this is perhaps an extreme manet

900
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,920
where we would say that we could have

901
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,400
ground entry points separate from space

902
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,800
based relay separate from landers we

903
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,560
really like talking about these

904
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,720
particular problems using these kinds of

905
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,200
examples partly because these are real

906
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,599
world problems or perhaps real off-world

907
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,160
problems that we're dealing with now but

908
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,040
additionally it helps us reason about

909
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,440
the problems in ways where we are not

910
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,320
going to fall into a local minima of a

911
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,480
solution that is not scalable

912
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,599
if a solution can can work with these

913
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,680
levels of propagation delay and if they

914
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,320
can work with these levels of disruption

915
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,040
then they will work for many cases of

916
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,359
propagation delay and many many frequent

917
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,599
disruptions so this is the management

918
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,440
model that we have

919
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,400
tagged as our hard problem to solve and

920
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,240
in that we see a couple of things

921
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,320
certainly a node a versus a node c but

922
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,720
intermediate nodes where you could have

923
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,280
an intermediate machine to machine

924
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,640
manager and agent relationship separate

925
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,520
from an end to end node a to node c

926
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,240
manager and agent relationship and the

927
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,680
idea that we would be able to have

928
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,560
either in regions or enclaves or spheres

929
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,720
of influence a machine-to-machine

930
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,480
management area a place where data

931
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,560
fusion could happen or a place where you

932
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,560
could have regional management that was

933
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,000
a very powerful

934
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,359
concept for us uh next slide please

935
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,920
so with that and using spacecraft as the

936
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,880
uh as the sort of driving example and

937
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,640
understanding that we wanted to look

938
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,000
more into autonomy and what was

939
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,640
typically a fault protection autonomy we

940
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,160
we did exactly that we looked at

941
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,320
spacecraft fault management systems they

942
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,880
tend to be stimulus response systems uh

943
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,040
focused on heritage implementations and

944
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,920
of course because of the

945
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,280
resource-constrained nature of the

946
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,040
compute environment they had very

947
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,359
deterministic processing and this was a

948
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,200
little different than what we see coming

949
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,200
out of ietf for for example the

950
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,960
management and data centers where

951
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,560
there's a lot of standards and open

952
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,640
source tools and much higher investments

953
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,200
into common solutions to common problems

954
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,960
as opposed to one spacecraft where you

955
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,839
have bespoke solutions to very unique

956
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,119
problems

957
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,960
at the time

958
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,240
and i understand that this slide is a

959
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,160
little bit data but at the time

960
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,079
there was a little more immaturity in

961
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,680
the asynchronousness and even in the

962
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,119
push models

963
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,359
but even today the overall autonomy that

964
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,839
we need for example in data centers is

965
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,680
not quite the same as the autonomy we

966
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,760
would like in these more challenged

967
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,200
environments

968
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,040
when i say inefficient implementations

969
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,880
and protocol layering i solely mean

970
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,359
there that as a as a function of

971
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,240
financial efficiency to reuse vendor

972
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,079
products and to layer things in ways

973
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,800
that that fit in and allow for

974
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,240
more agile

975
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,640
mixing and matching of capabilities we

976
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,720
can tolerate very very large protocol

977
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,280
stacks and separate responsibilities uh

978
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,000
in ways where we could see five ten uh

979
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,240
different protocol stacks together on a

980
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,640
typical spacecraft they compress that

981
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,720
because even the processing capability

982
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,640
is not always there so spacecraft are

983
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,359
not looking at processing you know xml

984
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,520
or large amounts of xml data as an

985
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,560
example far closer to iot than in a very

986
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,440
resourced data center and ultimately we

987
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,280
tried to answer the question if we put

988
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,680
these two worlds together what does that

989
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,680
overlap look like and is that a new

990
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,160
management capability for us

991
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,720
so if we then go to the next slide our

992
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,640
initial answer to that

993
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,720
was uh we felt that we needed something

994
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,480
different and we wanted to describe it

995
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,640
in a couple of different ways

996
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,880
the first was to take that original

997
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,560
delay tolerant network management

998
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,400
protocol dtnmp

999
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,480
and break it as renamed asynchronous

1000
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,599
management

1001
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,000
and soon to be renamed again in the dtn

1002
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,200
working group

1003
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
and we wanted to break it into three

1004
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,119
different statements the first at the

1005
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,680
time was uh aspirational what we would

1006
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,880
call sort of a manifesto of the needs of

1007
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,920
a very challenged environment that was

1008
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
written down and adopted by the dtn

1009
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,599
working group as the asynchronous

1010
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,599
management architecture and there is a

1011
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,560
reference to that the ama-03

1012
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,640
that is a working group item it is being

1013
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,480
refreshed it is being renamed

1014
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,079
i believe the delay tolerant network

1015
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,480
management architecture to really focus

1016
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,560
on the fact that we can't just call this

1017
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,800
asynchronous because asynchronous

1018
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,359
doesn't capture the full richness of

1019
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,640
needed autonomy and functioning in these

1020
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,920
allocronic

1021
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,800
um situat environments where things just

1022
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,640
don't exist in the network all at once

1023
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,960
and we have a very challenged experience

1024
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,359
but aspirationally there needs to be

1025
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,839
that problem statement and that overall

1026
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,040
architecture

1027
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,280
separate from that the data model

1028
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,359
becomes very very important because the

1029
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,240
data model between a local agent and a

1030
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,119
local management function separate from

1031
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,800
the relationship between a local

1032
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,280
management function and a remote manager

1033
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,119
perhaps in a more resourced part of the

1034
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,160
network

1035
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,760
we need to have a better and more

1036
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,000
reliable way of talking about the

1037
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,040
autonomy and the expression of behavior

1038
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,599
on the far side of the delay and the far

1039
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,280
side of the disruption

1040
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,319
and so we we term that the asynchronous

1041
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,560
management architecture management model

1042
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,000
as expressed in the asynchronous

1043
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,319
management architecture application data

1044
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:55,839
model or adm

1045
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,960
and and this sort of advisory uh model

1046
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,839
allows us to build uh managed objects

1047
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,240
and and the graphic to the right shows

1048
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,839
what a few of those are externally

1049
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,720
defined data literals operators controls

1050
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,040
like remote procedure calls almost and

1051
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,280
table data and custom reports and

1052
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,599
variables and so on to us this is an

1053
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,800
ecosystem in some ways uh the

1054
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,880
information here

1055
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
includes some things that we don't see

1056
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,119
in traditional management models and it

1057
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,800
explicitly

1058
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,880
prevents or excludes other things that

1059
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,480
we sometimes see in traditional

1060
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,400
management models and this was sort of

1061
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,920
the output of our system engineering

1062
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,760
around what we think is important in

1063
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,880
this space

1064
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,119
and then finally and perhaps even most

1065
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,599
simply there was the

1066
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,319
to be able to encode these models very

1067
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,119
very very compactly uh using seaboard

1068
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,599
but also structuring the messages and

1069
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,480
the model to entice a more compact

1070
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,240
encoding so in the amp the asynchronous

1071
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,920
management protocol

1072
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,119
we could using the dtn ion reference

1073
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,319
implementation say please add a contact

1074
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,560
into a contact graph

1075
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,400
and this is the nature of the contact

1076
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,920
and it is strongly typed and this is

1077
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,839
when it starts and tops and data rates

1078
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,760
and the node that it um starts from in

1079
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,000
the node that it goes to the entire

1080
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,200
command to accomplish that is about 26

1081
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,400
bytes

1082
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
and so being able to get those very very

1083
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,200
very compressed encodings uh is is

1084
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,440
important to us for a variety of reasons

1085
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,240
uh and and one of those of course is uh

1086
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,319
from an atomic transaction nature you

1087
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,640
want as many uh management commands and

1088
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,560
controls to be together in a payload at

1089
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,400
once but the other isn't a challenge

1090
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,880
network bandwidth can sometimes be at a

1091
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,079
premium

1092
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,920
and you don't want to take a thousand

1093
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,920
bytes to take to to communicate

1094
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,680
something that otherwise you could send

1095
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,800
in 26 bytes we have also had people uh

1096
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,720
look at at this set of ama adm and amp

1097
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,720
and and the data model associated with

1098
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,560
it and want to run it between micro

1099
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,960
controllers uh between systems because

1100
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,920
even their the efficiency uh and the the

1101
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,440
smallness of the data sizes are

1102
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,839
motivating as well so very very compact

1103
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,720
is important to us as well

1104
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,400
so then

1105
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,640
if we go uh just one more

1106
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,760
uh at currently there are some internet

1107
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,839
drafts there are personal drafts and

1108
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,680
then there are working group adopted

1109
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,160
drafts associated with some of this

1110
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,640
for the protocols that are of interest

1111
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,240
right now to the delay tolerant

1112
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,400
networking working group

1113
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,560
such as the application data models

1114
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,480
think uh the moral equivalent of yang

1115
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,920
models or uh mibs and snmp we have those

1116
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,480
for an ama agent itself we have it for

1117
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,240
the bundle protocol the bona protocol

1118
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,000
security protocol uh ltp uh for ion

1119
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,760
nasa's reference implementation of some

1120
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,000
of the dtn technologies

1121
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,720
and then we are also working to to

1122
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,839
define

1123
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,760
additionally other encodings and to

1124
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,599
bring in and understand how we interact

1125
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,119
better with yang

1126
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,480
we looked at building our adms our

1127
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,400
application data models using and

1128
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,800
specifying them in yang but at the time

1129
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,280
we were not able to specify

1130
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,280
quite everything we needed to and now

1131
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,200
that we have yang 1.1 we think we're a

1132
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,359
little bit closer to being able to just

1133
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,160
represent our autonomy model in the yang

1134
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,000
models but that is an ongoing bit of

1135
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,480
work between the d10 working group and

1136
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,319
then obviously some working groups in

1137
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,119
the ops area

1138
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,599
uh the next slide just has a couple of

1139
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,160
uh forward link references

1140
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,800
and then i was going to stop here there

1141
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,040
are a couple of additional uh slides in

1142
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,800
terms of what we think are important as

1143
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,599
part of that overall network management

1144
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,599
architecture but in the interest of time

1145
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,200
i just wanted to pause and see if there

1146
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,200
were any questions about what we've

1147
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,000
covered so far

1148
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,560
okay

1149
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,799
um ron how how are we doing one time

1150
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,200
you have uh a good ten minutes

1151
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,440
excellent so if if we could then go uh

1152
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,839
forward again

1153
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,599
if if we poke a little more into what we

1154
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,280
think are important architectural

1155
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,720
components

1156
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,720
the we have laid things out in our

1157
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,720
initial architecture document in terms

1158
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,800
of service definitions and

1159
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,440
desirable properties of the system

1160
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,079
from a service definition standpoint we

1161
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,599
have to define

1162
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,040
management for us as more than the

1163
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,960
generation and communication of

1164
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,920
performance monitoring data the and this

1165
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,000
goes back to the observation that closed

1166
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,839
loop control end to end is just not

1167
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,440
going to work in the kind of

1168
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,599
environments that we operate in

1169
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,720
we need

1170
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,640
local agents to be able to change their

1171
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,319
own configuration

1172
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,280
as as we respond to local events without

1173
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,680
a remote manager in the loop

1174
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,440
we obviously need to be able to generate

1175
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,760
reports but we want to be able to

1176
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,760
generate reports uh either as a function

1177
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,480
of time or a function of local state and

1178
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,400
we may generate reports even if we're

1179
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,640
not sure that someone is listening

1180
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,480
that's a very typical thing to do for

1181
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,960
example in a spacecraft system where you

1182
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,720
may only check in with your spacecraft

1183
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,400
once a week and when you do check in

1184
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,839
with the spacecraft as a function of

1185
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,599
when you can get dish time or deep space

1186
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,920
network time in general then you want

1187
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,680
all of the data that was produced

1188
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,839
appropriately over time to come down

1189
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,440
with the appropriate timestamps so that

1190
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,440
you could forensically you know

1191
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,800
reconstruct what happened on the

1192
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,119
spacecraft while you weren't checking in

1193
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,720
and we think that any sort of network

1194
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,640
management system needs to be able to

1195
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,200
operate in that way the difference of

1196
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,200
course is that if you put that together

1197
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,480
with autonomous parameterized control

1198
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,880
you don't want to simply generate

1199
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,000
performance report data and cache it on

1200
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,319
the managed node until it could be sent

1201
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,800
back to someone at a future time you

1202
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,760
want to generate that data and then

1203
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,880
have a local management function operate

1204
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,599
off of that cache of data so that you

1205
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,319
can get local autonomous parameterized

1206
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,440
control while the remote manager is not

1207
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,079
connected to the system or is too far

1208
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,200
away from a propagation perspective

1209
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,640
and then lastly to make this

1210
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,079
to to be able to to use this system not

1211
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,480
just within standard authentication

1212
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,960
between nodes in a network you also need

1213
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,640
more fine-grained administration as to

1214
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,200
who is allowed to see what data and who

1215
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,960
is allowed to you know issue what

1216
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,079
controls

1217
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,760
typically is a function of access

1218
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,040
control and role access control

1219
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,960
so if those are the fundamental services

1220
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,599
larger than performance monitoring the

1221
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,200
properties of how we would want to

1222
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,440
create that are also important as we

1223
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,640
said before the design of the system can

1224
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,800
either inhibit or entice

1225
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,280
more effective and efficient encodings

1226
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,000
and the design of the autonomy model and

1227
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,079
the local autonomy engines that go off

1228
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,520
of those models

1229
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,440
either can lend themselves to more or

1230
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,760
less efficient or hardware accelerated

1231
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,160
implementation easier or harder to

1232
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,520
secure

1233
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,240
by role execution and then just more

1234
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,319
palatability in terms of what you would

1235
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,880
implement in a in a secure or

1236
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,160
operational or otherwise um you know far

1237
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,599
away system

1238
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,119
the first obviously is that the

1239
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:26,800
intelligent push of information is

1240
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,079
required here we cannot simply ask we

1241
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,319
cannot respond to pull requests from

1242
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,720
information we need to determine what we

1243
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,800
need on the platform itself we know that

1244
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,920
now

1245
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,000
minimizing message size is very very big

1246
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,680
for us and i mentioned this on the prior

1247
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,400
slide if i can get a message out in 26

1248
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,559
bytes instead of a thousand bytes

1249
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,720
i think we should be tuning our models

1250
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,400
to that reality

1251
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,800
because very very tiny message sizes are

1252
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,880
enabling in many of the areas where we

1253
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,280
need this local autonomy as a function

1254
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,880
of the challenge of the network or the

1255
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,720
challenge of the environment

1256
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,480
when we talk about absolute data

1257
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,559
identification is part of a network

1258
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,400
management system that we can

1259
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,200
unambiguously reference data and of

1260
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,480
course we can do that in all of our

1261
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,880
network management systems however if

1262
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,440
you combine absolute data identification

1263
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,240
with minimized message size then the

1264
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,160
construction of that naming scheme the

1265
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,200
uris the hierarchical nature of the

1266
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,400
naming trees the ability to truncate and

1267
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,559
assign nicknames or encodings or

1268
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,440
enumerations of of portions and nodes

1269
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,119
within a naming tree

1270
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,960
all of that needs to be thought out very

1271
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,400
very carefully

1272
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,000
if we were to look for example at other

1273
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,240
things like i believe yang sids which is

1274
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,720
a terrific idea

1275
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,480
it is good if we can support say 63-bit

1276
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,960
identifiers as hashes over some part of

1277
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,800
a naming tree but if you want to run

1278
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,240
regular expressions against it and

1279
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,079
there's not a hierarchy behind it to

1280
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:56,079
compare different sids then it becomes

1281
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,599
hard to do that

1282
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,839
that kind of globular naming and

1283
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,920
reasoning about things

1284
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,000
custom data identification was also

1285
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
important to us and the idea that you

1286
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,680
need it in the context of a mission or

1287
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,680
an operational deployment to be able to

1288
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,160
build custom reports custom variables

1289
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,200
custom

1290
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,599
other bits of reporting rules time-based

1291
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,599
rule state-based rules and you need to

1292
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,440
be able to name those as well and those

1293
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,040
don't necessarily have to be globally

1294
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,720
unique if they exist within like a

1295
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,599
particular operator's name space

1296
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,119
and then lastly of course is the

1297
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,520
autonomous operation

1298
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,880
if we go to the next slide

1299
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,200
the the general architecture is not

1300
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,040
dramatically different to accomplish

1301
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,760
this we have agents and we have managers

1302
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,760
we rely again based on minimizing

1303
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,040
message size on pre-shared schemas the

1304
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,400
ability to communicate that during

1305
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,800
periods of configuration and our model

1306
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,800
does except for the fact that there are

1307
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,200
times when you can share

1308
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,280
and you do have end to end connectivity

1309
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,040
even if it's in a dtn and it's not

1310
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,880
contiguous that eventually you can get a

1311
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,559
message from one side of the network to

1312
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:01,440
the other

1313
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,000
that you can use that for configuration

1314
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,920
as long as that configuration can then

1315
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,960
include the the behaviors that need to

1316
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:09,920
be

1317
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,559
autonomously managed until the next time

1318
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,400
you get an opportunity for more

1319
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,760
configuration coming back

1320
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,000
next slide

1321
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,680
and then sort of lastly in some of the

1322
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,520
initial prototyping work that we had

1323
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,559
done the application data model to this

1324
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:29,280
autonomy model is something that we

1325
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,000
model in json we have also modeled to

1326
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,240
the extent that yang at the time could

1327
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,240
support some of the expressions that we

1328
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,040
needed we also managed or modeled these

1329
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,240
in json

1330
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,200
and then

1331
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,480
if we go one more slide

1332
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,319
this becomes the autonomy model again

1333
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,800
that that we model uh in json and in

1334
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,599
cbor on the wire

1335
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:52,319
and

1336
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,319
or past that is just sort of an example

1337
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,400
of what that encoding might look like uh

1338
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,319
in in json for the bundle protocol

1339
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:02,480
and it it sort of speaks to if we go one

1340
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,040
more slide

1341
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,280
yes if

1342
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,960
the the reason i like to bring this kind

1343
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,480
of encoding up and then i will pause

1344
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,000
here

1345
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,839
is that

1346
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,960
we also uh try to build our model

1347
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,359
around things that would prevent us from

1348
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:22,000
having to do back and forth exchanges

1349
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,280
between

1350
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,760
really a local agent and a remote

1351
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,599
manager but also even a local agent and

1352
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,240
a local manager and the idea behind this

1353
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,440
uh is is in the the second uh named item

1354
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,839
here bundles by priority where we have a

1355
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,359
piece of externally defined data an

1356
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,440
unsigned integer that stands for bundles

1357
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,839
by priority but this unsigned integer

1358
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:44,559
data value can take a parameter

1359
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:47,200
and the parameter is a mask of the kind

1360
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,720
of information that you would like and

1361
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,200
so this idea there's some syntactic

1362
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,440
sugar built into our model to allow us

1363
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,760
to do associative lookups almost like

1364
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,240
function calls with the with generation

1365
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,480
of even simple data types to avoid

1366
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,480
having to say things like what kind of

1367
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,160
information do you have or how would you

1368
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,760
map that information and then once we

1369
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,160
get it back then making a second call to

1370
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,760
down select within that set of

1371
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,520
information

1372
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,520
so just in general that's a little bit

1373
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,520
of a history of the ama it's being

1374
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,119
picked up and rebranded as delay

1375
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,359
tolerant network management it does

1376
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,119
still have an aspirational piece which

1377
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,440
is the problem we're trying to solve it

1378
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,839
has a data modeling piece it has a set

1379
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,240
of encodings content encoding separate

1380
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,240
from will will eventually also be

1381
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,240
transport encodings

1382
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,960
and the model has focused on trying to

1383
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,599
enable very deterministic autonomy

1384
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,760
without requiring building scripting

1385
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,359
languages and mobile code because

1386
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,359
sometimes there are obviously security

1387
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,799
issues around deploying that

1388
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,799
particularly in resource constraint

1389
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:48,799
systems that you don't check up on quite

1390
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:49,920
so often

1391
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,760
so if anyone is more interested in the

1392
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,359
details of this work i would be happy to

1393
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:55,760
answer questions here or talk to people

1394
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,359
offline as we go

1395
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,880
thank you very much

1396
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,960
people need to know that uh

1397
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,440
i only asked to do this a couple of days

1398
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,079
ago and he stepped up and agreed to do

1399
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,280
it so

1400
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,680
a big thank you

1401
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,200
and i think that

1402
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:19,280
this is this could be relevant uh to uh

1403
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,760
to manage also because with our

1404
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,480
protocols we try to keep the network

1405
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,119
connected but some somehow

1406
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,119
the laws of physics get in the way

1407
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,200
sometimes and if the distance is too

1408
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,200
great for your radio range or or there

1409
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,599
are obstacles or

1410
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,839
or there's jamming or whatever

1411
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:39,040
then

1412
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,599
yeah you were your mayonnaise may easily

1413
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,559
break into two or more pieces

1414
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:47,280
and i think that then

1415
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,920
this asynchronous management

1416
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,160
approach

1417
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,920
can help

1418
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,799
to

1419
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:57,280
have these

1420
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,839
these uh fragments of the uh of the

1421
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:02,400
network uh sort of manage themselves uh

1422
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,079
with some uh some uh

1423
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,720
guidance that has been uh preloaded into

1424
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,079
them

1425
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:11,280
and they can

1426
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,200
phone home so to speak as soon as they

1427
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,119
can

1428
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,079
um

1429
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,480
but i would like to hear from from

1430
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,119
other uh participants in this session if

1431
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,440
they have any comments or ideas we have

1432
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,400
just a couple of minutes left

1433
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,680
not all at once please

1434
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,079
well i i was thinking that

1435
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,319
do you think this uh this applies back

1436
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:49,200
to non-delay networks too like is there

1437
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,359
benefits that you know looking at

1438
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,200
something in the extreme but then say

1439
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,680
taking it back to regular networks is

1440
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,079
there something you see that

1441
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,040
you could also use

1442
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,799
absolutely so the the

1443
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,720
and a lot of some of the additional

1444
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,240
asynchronous behavior that we're seeing

1445
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,440
coming out of

1446
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,280
ops area is the observation that just

1447
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,960
sending everything back to a common

1448
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,720
central management place

1449
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,559
is is difficult and generates way too

1450
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,280
much traffic um in well-resourced

1451
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,960
networks because of course the data is

1452
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,000
scaling

1453
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
the next part of that is if you're able

1454
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,559
to filter what you choose to push

1455
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,720
then you can also start tolerating

1456
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,160
operating in different transport

1457
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,240
environments and so

1458
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,079
all the way down to microscale we have

1459
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,760
microprocessors that would say instead

1460
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,240
of using something like our map uh there

1461
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,599
are times when our processor is just

1462
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,240
literally turned off uh and another say

1463
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,760
a managing processor is turned off and

1464
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,280
then turns back on again and wouldn't it

1465
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,040
be nice to be able to have these

1466
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,119
communications and you know that's all

1467
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:51,200
on a single embedded platform so we're

1468
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,880
not quite talking about delays and

1469
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,440
disruptions in that particular way but

1470
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,000
the other is if you want a synchronous

1471
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,640
behavior without requiring tls sessions

1472
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,960
for example this is a good way of saying

1473
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,760
that if my if my two nodes are otherwise

1474
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,520
resourced but they are they are turned

1475
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,720
off and they

1476
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,400
when they when they come up they do have

1477
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,680
good um

1478
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,839
ability to communicate with one another

1479
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:16,559
the real uh benefit here is to be able

1480
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,160
to quickly synchronize on what

1481
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,319
autonomous actions did you take when i

1482
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:22,319
disconnected from you or when i didn't

1483
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:24,400
have a session with you and if you were

1484
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,000
able to have that behavior you can then

1485
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,359
start building in the fact that you

1486
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,599
don't need the infrastructure and the

1487
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,839
cost and the expense to always maintain

1488
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:33,599
those sessions or re-establish those

1489
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:34,480
sessions

1490
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,480
and and so the amount of time that your

1491
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,240
remote partner actually have to be

1492
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,440
online

1493
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,119
can be reduced

1494
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,280
even if otherwise you could choose the

1495
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,520
expense to always have it online and we

1496
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,280
think that there are cost savings there

1497
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,440
without sacrificing the responsiveness

1498
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,480
of the managed device

1499
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,558
thank you

1500
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,799
and

1501
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:03,280
with that i think we're out of time

1502
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,760
um there's one other thing that i forgot

1503
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,599
to mention uh at the beginning of the

1504
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:08,559
meeting

1505
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,119
is that uh overall made me aware of a

1506
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,720
presentation yesterday that i missed on

1507
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,799
uh

1508
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:20,079
low earth orbiting satellites

1509
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:21,599
and the

1510
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:22,720
potential

1511
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,799
routing problems erotic problems that

1512
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:27,359
they may have in those networks

1513
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,040
and

1514
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,200
unfortunately i did not have the time to

1515
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,960
work through the uh

1516
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,839
the draft that was produced there

1517
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:37,280
and presented

1518
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,079
but

1519
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:38,880
i

1520
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,640
i'm going to be in contact i see that

1521
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,119
at least someone from the group was

1522
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:47,839
was attending

1523
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,559
linhan

1524
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,359
so

1525
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,119
i hope to

1526
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,880
to be able to uh

1527
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,520
to have a chat uh

1528
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,599
in the near future and in fact i i'm

1529
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,480
going to go into uh gather

1530
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,040
after this meeting and if anybody wants

1531
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,160
to uh

1532
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,799

they were talking about uh low orbit

1558
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,039
routing

1559
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:10,640
i'm not sure but if

1560
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,720

1570
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,880
the irtf because

1571
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,960
it is a

1572
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,520
a popular topic i guess

1595
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:55,079
stare blankly until uh

1596
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:07,839
well people are either

1597
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:09,839
just waking up and logging out or the

1598
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:13,160
just timeout

1599
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,039
yeah i think

1600
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,680
so i had a suggestion we should find a

1601
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,200
sexy logo

1602
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,960
for the group

1603
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,079
yes

1604
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:31,200
uh sorry i didn't respond to that

1605
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,839
no that's fine

1606
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,079
now with this

1607
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:38,480
this all the satellite stuff

1608
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,960
maybe you should uh change your airplane

1609
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,200
to a satellite

1610
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,240
yeah yeah i was thinking about that but

1611
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,039
it was actually very simple to do i saw

1612
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:51,839
i saw an example of that

1613
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:54,400
it only it only took about 15 minutes to

1614
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,520
do that

1615
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,160
ah good

1616
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:01,039
all right

1617
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:03,280
i'll see you next time

1618
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,039
on the list

1619
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:06,960
yeah certainly i have a number of

1620
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,839
actions

1621
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:12,400
okay

1622
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,200
so there are some notes uh that should

1623
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,280
be available too so

1624
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,079
i will download those yes

1625
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:23,079
okay

1626
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:50,920
