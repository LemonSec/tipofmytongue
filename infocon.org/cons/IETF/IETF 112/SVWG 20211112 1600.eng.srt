78
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,440
and we will discuss support for starting

79
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,480
an adoption

80
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,400
call of this ah

81
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,120
we've already done this um

82
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,680
this is an old slide that got

83
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,480
needs to be updated

84
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,439
and rst 496 or this is on the tele chat

85
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,760
nuts up um past working group last call

86
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,959
then received some external review as we

87
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,360
invited an external reviewer to look at

88
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,239
it it received review comments

89
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,399
there was these were late they were

90
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,320
substantial in that they were talking

91
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,959
about possible other use cases

92
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,960
it was discussed at the interim and it's

93
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,040
currently back with the working group

94
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,680
for a new revision so we'll talk about

95
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
that document here

96
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,960
hopefully we'll turn it around the

97
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,520
working group for a short period of time

98
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,919
and then we'll resubmit that to the iesg

99
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,240
for publication that would be our plan

100
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,800
next slide

101
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,759
um

102
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,680
we'll be done here so let's see if we

103
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,199
can get a

104
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,120
this is this is michael tuxen's slide um

105
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,320
on this little head michael

106
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,600
yeah this is about our rfc 4960 biz our

107
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,160
next slide

108
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,080
uh these are the

109
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,599
earlier versions next slide

110
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,080
this is what happened between the last

111
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,280
itf and this one we had two revision or

112
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,680
three revisions basically cleaning up

113
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,639
things and revision 15 went into last

114
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,680
call

115
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,320
and we got

116
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,000
we have the director directorate reviews

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,720
and we have ad reviews and

118
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,840
some of them

119
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,039
where the form uh the protocol

120
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,280
could change in a substantial way which

121
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,520
were rejected and some other changes

122
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,840
which were incorporated next slide

123
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,560
so the changes which have been

124
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,600
incorporated is it has been clarified

125
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,919
how to handle the case when an

126
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,440
advertised receiver window is smaller

127
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,400
than 1500 which is required

128
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,520
um

129
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,319
there was a discussion

130
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,039
with the security people

131
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,360
on the cookie so it's

132
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,240
made explicit that the content of the

133
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,199
state

134
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,680
cookie is implementation dependent that

135
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,400
the cookie is not encrypted or at least

136
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,240
that's the specification does not

137
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,280
require it to be encrypted

138
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,400
and that the key used to sign this stuff

139
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,560
should be changed frequently and

140
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,360
frequently is specified as hourly for

141
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,840
example

142
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,960
the limits for outstanding tsns and ssns

143
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,280
well we're using

144
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,080
should not and that is chain has been

145
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,919
changed to must not

146
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,319
um and one

147
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,360
other change was that um

148
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,520
during slow start the condition was only

149
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,639
increased

150
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,600
if the comb egg point has been moved

151
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,639
forward

152
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,240
um this has been this was changed

153
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,039
in

154
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,720
earlier versions of the specification

155
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,000
this applied to slow start and

156
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,680
congestion avoidance this was changed

157
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,000
for congestion's avoidance but not for

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,759
slow start this is now also changed for

159
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,039
slow start

160
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,080
and

161
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,360
the ayanna

162
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,560
section has been updated and

163
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,360
it was missing a policy for the ppids

164
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,280
all the other changes are improving

165
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,560
birding

166
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,400

167
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,960
from mid-december and i'm expecting some

168
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,479

169
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,159

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,720
um any people who want to look at that

174
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,599
draft and spot something that needs to

175
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,680
be addressed or tweaked within those

176
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,840
changes then please let us know it's

177
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,360
still changeable

178
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,280
but um we we believe it's finished and

179
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,720
therefore it will be on the telechat

180
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,280
agenda in december

181
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,199
other than that on to michael to talk

182
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,319
about the nuts support document

183
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,319
yeah this document

184
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,360
came back to the working group and i

185
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,960
submitted version

186
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,800
23 just because

187
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,440
to keep it alive there are no changes

188
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,680
made right now we got um two reviews

189
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,800
from

190
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
ads

191
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,319
magnus and martin

192
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,440
and

193
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,599
there is an alternative

194
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,240
suggestion from claudio

195
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,520
so

196
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,919
next slide

197
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,159
basically the the major issues except

198
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,519
for wording

199
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,039
clarification

200
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,240
whatever is uh are listed here handing

201
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,360
off ip fragmentation at the net um i

202
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,080
don't know how to address that so

203
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,560
controlling net friendly behavior of an

204
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,560
endpoint so how does an endpoint know

205
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,399
that he's behind an ad and should

206
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,920
behave like this

207
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,000
this is addressable by looking for

208
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,279
example at the local addresses

209
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,360
multi-homing support of internal hosts

210
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
can be improved support of multiple

211
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,399
external addresses should be improved

212
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,080
um

213
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,560
remote addresses are not in the nut

214
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,080
binding table they were removed there to

215
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,920
make things simpler this was

216
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,279
it was

217
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,519
requested that this should be put back

218
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,760
at least in the case where restarts are

219
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,440
not disabled

220
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,560
um

221
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
it was the point about

222
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,360
the pack the the complexity of packet

223
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,160
processing at the middle box so does the

224
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,080
middle box need to understand chunks or

225
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,959
not

226
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,760
and basically the most uh

227
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,320
substantial in my view comment is that

228
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,399
the stock the current document changes

229
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,920
the definition of an association that

230
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,839
takes the verification tag into account

231
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,200
and has to deal with

232
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,279
the case that this is not supported by

233
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,360
the endpoints so basically these are the

234
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,440
major issues and if you go to the next

235
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,200
slide

236
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,959
then um

237
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,480
these are

238
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,399
potential ways forward

239
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,560
one is to improve the current method

240
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,600
which addresses issue two to five

241
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,279
um

242
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,480
that will make things more complex

243
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,640
and one of the issues also was that the

244
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,320
document is already

245
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,480
complex so another way to move forward

246
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,519
would be

247
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,320
just to use the fallback algorithm so

248
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,560
basically it's like

249
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,600
the endpoints have this understanding of

250
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,480
this

251
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,279
verification tag but it's important for

252
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,839
the association and if this is not

253
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,000
uh possible then they

254
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,600
the document already has a fallback

255
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,000
mechanism and we could just use that for

256
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,680
that mechanism that would address issue

257
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,120
two to seven

258
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,600
um which is basically never disable

259
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,680
restarts don't use verification tags

260
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,200
anymore just do

261
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,040
net as you would do it if you come from

262
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,839
udp or tcp land

263
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:58,839
and

264
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,399
um it reduces complexity it increases

265
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,240
the change of

266
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,920
chance of collisions

267
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,800
um

268
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,880
the third way would be switch to uh

269
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
claudia's draft and drop the current

270
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
working document or the fourth solution

271
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,360
would be just drop the work or not at

272
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,240
all

273
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,040
uh basically saying if we go for two

274
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,240
this is

275
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,480
very similar to udp or

276
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,880
udp or tcp so we don't need to specify

277
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,200
it the only way would be how do the

278
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,040
endpoints

279
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,800
behave that wouldn't be specified so

280
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,399
these are the four options

281
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,959
how to move forward and

282
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,000
that's what i need input on before

283
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,480
changing the document

284
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,079
so does anybody

285
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,399
currently um on this call wish to

286
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,920
make contributions

287
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,360
do you want to

288
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,320
comment on any of these methods or

289
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,839
or offer to review them

290
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,040
so i guess the reviews are out magnus

291
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,079
and martin did a very good job in

292
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,480
describing the issues so the issues are

293
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,800
clear

294
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,279
the question is how to address them

295
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,839
marcus

296
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,880
yes i i do think uh i have to think a

297
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,639
bit more about what's the implications

298
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,760
of these examples and but

299
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,079
i think we should be able to

300
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,920
i i am clouded probably work together

301
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,560
and try to see what we think jointly on

302
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,720
these issues from our perspective um but

303
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,839
we see that

304
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,480
but i will i will promise to think about

305
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,720
it and and come back i would say in

306
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,279
within a few weeks

307
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,200
i think that sounds an excellent title

308
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,440
and

309
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,200
get the three groups of people to talk

310
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,800
about it oh claudio do you want to say

311
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,120
something

312
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,680
can you hear me

313
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,560
okay go ahead speaker go ahead i don't

314
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
know i i really would like to help in

315
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,959
this area and

316
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,680
this option number three

317
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,560
is

318
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,440
we talked about is more or less a subset

319
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,880
of the the current draft it's not really

320
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,200
a revolution so if

321
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,160
we

322
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,800
could avoid dropping all the work done

323
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,600
i'm not and find a solution i am really

324
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,399
willing to help

325
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,360
yeah this has been the longest work item

326
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,800
we've had

327
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,079
and

328
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,120
that's not been through lack of interest

329
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,880
but maybe because we took on higher

330
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,959
priority things in between so it'd be

331
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,920
nice to see this finish

332
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,240
and i don't want to go for option four

333
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,720
but inevitably that will be the option

334
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,360
we arrive at if we don't get conclusion

335
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,519
quite soon

336
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,519
christian

337
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,560
christine you're in queue

338
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,480
yeah

339
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,440
this reminds me of something we did in a

340
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,519
quick format

341
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,320
and

342
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,040
one of the problem of not traversal is

343
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,240
that

344
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,199
once you start managing not also

345
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,399
actively

346
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,519
you expose yourself to a set of attacks

347
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,600
by forge ip addresses

348
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,720
that is it becomes easy to mount

349
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,639
the man on the side attack or something

350
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,920
like that

351
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,360
in which someone takes an otherwise

352
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,800
packet

353
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,680
changes the source ip address

354
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,480
and sends that to the other point

355
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,680
and that creates all kinds of

356
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,000
stat explosion issues or denial of

357
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,920
service issues etc and i don't see that

358
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,600
in the security consideration of your

359
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,279
draft

360
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,040
so i i think that you should at least

361
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,399
consider what's happening there

362
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,959
could you describe one

363
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,720
attack scenario in particular in an

364
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,120
email

365
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,959
uh you want me to send you an email with

366
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,040
the attack scenario

367
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,760
with one so who's the attacker who how

368
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,440
does he behave and what does he um

369
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,680
yeah i mean yeah okay

370
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
i can send you an email but the short

371
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,000
summary is that the attacker

372
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,360
the purpose of the attacker is to

373
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,440
disrupt your communication

374
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,839
so the attacker affects the not

375
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,240
rebinding

376
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,279
and by faking the not rebinding

377
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,079
they

378
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,160
convince the other point

379
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,519
that your ip address has changed

380
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,160
the the way the net binding changes is

381
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,680
done in a specific way here

382
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,839
well basically the change in that

383
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,759
binding to point to something where the

384
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,519
source is something that comes how can

385
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,680
you change it

386
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,759
by because

387
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,279
not rebinding

388
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,199
is something that you

389
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,759
that the other point detect by looking

390
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,000
at incoming packets

391
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,759
if you change incoming packets you

392
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,199
should you can

393
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,040
you can basically drive that detection

394
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,720
so the net

395
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,959
the net binding is not changed

396
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,959
dynamically that binding has not changed

397
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,480
i do not

398
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,199
but

399
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,759
spoof's packet has arrived at the other

400
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,079
points

401
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,519
can you please send an email

402
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,199
and i'll help you

403
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,399
i will send you email because

404
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,720
basically if you if you want to do that

405
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,600
that's the reason why something quick

406
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,920
in when you have a natural binding

407
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
you get a set of probes sends to the

408
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,240
previous and the old address

409
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,160
and all the kind of mechanism like that

410
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,199
so we we we

411
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,240
um verify path before we start using

412
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,919
them and this kind of stuff is an scp

413
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,000
i think probably we should take this as

414
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,799
an email uh thread on the list it sounds

415
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,480
like anything that probes into the

416
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,720
security aspects is likely to

417
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,799
help shed a little bit of light whether

418
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,720
we need new text or not i guess we'll

419
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,280
become quite clear as we discuss it

420
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,319
okay

421
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,679
thanks christian

422
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,400
really appreciate it

423
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,039
okay so the next person to talk will be

424
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,320
magnus

425
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,760
i'm talking about the dtls over sctp

426
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,760
document

427
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,200
and here's magnus

428
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,720
there

429
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,160
so

430
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,960
yes um so i i'm

431
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,440
here to talk about the details of stp

432
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,840
this work

433
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,480
uh

434
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,919
so um

435
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,400
yes we have done ericsson has done two

436
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,480
ipr disclosures related to this draft

437
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,000
so i want to remind you about the goal

438
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,760
here that the main goal here was really

439
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,840
to ensure that the dealers can protect

440
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,240
larger than 16

441
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,360
384 bytes large sctp messages

442
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,679
and that this work is done on s on 30

443
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,400
people's request

444
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,600
in this work we kind of

445
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,960
concluded on some of the right

446
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
requirements especially in relation to

447
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,520
the 3d vp use case about long linked

448
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,559
fctp associations where we have

449
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,400
association that could potentially for

450
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,520
weeks and months the need for and that

451
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,440
leads to periodic uh mutual

452
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,480
re-authentication is needed it requires

453
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,160
re-keying with

454
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,760
probably if you have monkey exchange to

455
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,679
ensure forward secrecy

456
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,919
to reduce the impact of any key reveal

457
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,760
and we also need to re-key stb auth

458
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,360
even if that algorithm is strong with

459
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,880
shock 256 and has a long

460
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,520
lifetime it's it's not that long so

461
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,440
probably um

462
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
and we also want to support both dtls

463
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,200
1.2 and 1.3 for having a upgrade path

464
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,440
ensuring that we actually

465
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,160
can move forward with details versions

466
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,960
so next slide

467
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,200
so uh

468
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,360
in those issues we hadn't discussed slot

469
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,440
meeting emeralds in the new draft we are

470
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,720
proposing

471
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,080
uh parallel dtls connections uh

472
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,520
and there were several issues that led

473
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,880
us here i mean detail is 1.3 lacs mutual

474
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,720
real authentication and has no forward

475
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,080
secrets

476
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,160
providing re-keying

477
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,080
and dts 1.2 renegotiation is unsecured

478
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,000
without neutral authentication and

479
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,160
therefore it's often disabled even if in

480
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,080
this use case it would be with mutual

481
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
authentication

482
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,320
and we also struggle with determining

483
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,039
when keys for detailers and ssv oauth

484
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,200
could be retired

485
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,159
so

486
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,480
preferably without requiring draining at

487
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,840
key updates

488
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,880
so

489
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,799
and that be draining i mean getting all

490
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,799
messages flushed out

491
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,679
basic footed connection to idle and then

492
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,120
re-key

493
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,880
so uh solution we propose here is to use

494
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,600
the dls connection spiral so when you

495
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,280
need to re-key or reauthenticate the

496
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,559
pair

497
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,000
you initiate a full detail as handshake

498
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,080
to enable this we use details connection

499
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,039
ids in all details records to multiplex

500
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:35,840
on

501
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,919
and because we're also saying we don't

502
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,440
need me to have more interview live at

503
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,559
any point a single byte connection id is

504
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,280
fully sufficient for this use case

505
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,080
and they can wrap and that will be many

506
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,240
many hours between

507
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,720
reducing the same connection id

508
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,320
representation

509
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,840
so uh

510
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,880
and

511
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,240
when you're gonna switch

512
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,799
you have to

513
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,720
when all else details record records

514
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,880
protected by the old key has been sent

515
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,200
and acknowledged in a non-renegable way

516
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,640
so you know that you've emptied out the

517
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,559
pipeway you know that all

518
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,760
all

519
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,840
stp packets related to these

520
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,960
sap messages are on on the receiver side

521
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,720
then you go forward and close the

522
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,200
details connection that has these keys

523
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,600
related to

524
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,720
and it becomes the sender's

525
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,200
responsibility for this

526
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,520
[Music]

527
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,360
and you do it in each direction

528
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,840
individually to this indication so when

529
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,640
both has closed you can remove the whole

530
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,600
details connection latest state

531
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,919
so that's basically how it works uh next

532
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,000
slide

533
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,960
so um the benefits you see it's they

534
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,640
have no dependency on detailers for

535
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,679
keying or re-authentication features

536
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,240
there's no functionality changes between

537
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,760
support and detail is 1.2 or 1.3

538
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,679
we think this is a good

539
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,919
property here

540
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,720
we currently see no limitations of the

541
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,440
number of reakings you can perform

542
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
which we've before had

543
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,440
we have neutral video authentications

544
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,720
and

545
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
and full different helm in exchange for

546
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,400
each

547
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,919
time you rekey

548
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,720
with forward secrecy and the key reveal

549
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,480
basically comes limit to a single key

550
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,960
period so if you're working every hour

551
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,159
the most data leak is one hour basically

552
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,080
and it becomes very hard to attack this

553
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,200
because

554
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,120
then you basically need to be able to

555
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,840
authenticate as the pair

556
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,799
so

557
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,440
yeah

558
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,320
and

559
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,600
yes

560
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,799
so this needs feedback

561
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,559
if there is one that finds any you

562
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,480
should really post to solutions so we

563
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,720
need more eyes reviewing to secure

564
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,640
description etc

565
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,799
uh the target here would be to go

566
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,280
towards working blast call after review

567
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,919
and draft updates and we are sleeping a

568
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,480
bit on the timelines here that we really

569
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,559
thought we could hold but that's with

570
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,080
from the struggle of finding a solution

571
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,000
i think

572
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,159
uh

573
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,320
so

574
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,280
i think that was all the slides

575
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,080
yes martin

576
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,080
martin

577
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,280
uh

578
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,960
maybe i'm confused but

579
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,799
if this is in fact where their ipr

580
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,480
issues can you clarify what those issues

581
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,640
are

582
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,360
i mean we are declared ipr

583
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,520
on that we

584
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,720
we have some

585
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,360
uh ipr that we think relates to this

586
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
draft

587
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,200
we have made licensing uh statements

588
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,080
about that we will license it

589
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,320
it

590
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,320
yes i understand from i mean parker's

591
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
comments is that certain open source

592
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,400
implementations but

593
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,559
perhaps struggle with

594
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,360
implementing this but yeah

595
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,159
um

596
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,159
and and the comment that i i mean one

597
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,840
thing i can see here if the problem is

598
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,320
that we replace 683 i mean we don't need

599
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,559
to obsolete we need a spec that is a

600
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,640
solution that we can give to provide to

601
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,120
3dpp so if if the problem is that the

602
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,720
obsolete the

603
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,880
so far non-claimed

604
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,279
is where there's no ipr claims

605
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,440
i mean that's fine for us it's from our

606
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,520
perspective yes we need a specification

607
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,720
that solves this

608
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,039
thanks

609
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,159
thank you um i think we will have to

610
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,200
revisit the ipr status

611
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,360
as we progress the work

612
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,880
but

613
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,200
let's take michael tucson's comment as

614
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,240
well michael

615
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,320
yeah it's a bit in the direction of what

616
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,679
martin said so

617
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,240
if you want to seek your http traffic

618
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,680
and

619
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,640
[Music]

620
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,080
limit yourself on what's been

621
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,000
standardized by the ietf then you have

622
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,400
three solutions one is ipsec based one

623
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,240
is tls base which was which is very old

624
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,880
i'm not aware of any deployment and

625
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,120
it was only done because it was needed

626
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,799
and there was no dtls and we couldn't

627
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,200
change http we couldn't change tls and

628
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,559
there's the dtls solution

629
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,279
http wise dtls wise it's implemented in

630
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,039
open source implementation so you can

631
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:30,400
use open source stacks for http for

632
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,960
dtls and networks

633
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,320
um and i'm concerned about replacing

634
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,840
this with something which is iprs

635
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,480
which we don't know yet and i mean

636
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,559
well we don't know yet what what the

637
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,159
iprs cover

638
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,320
and so right now this can't be

639
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,400
implemented in any open source

640
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,520
um

641
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,679
implementation that's what i'm concerned

642
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,640
about and what i'm not sure if if that's

643
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,240
the direction the working group wants to

644
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,760
go or

645
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,039
i mean

646
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,240
the goals are fine um and i think

647
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,480
the original spec needs an update but

648
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,799
i'm not sure if the working group wants

649
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,639
a version which is ipr protected

650
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,679
i think i would rather take that as a

651
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,080
real question to a future meeting when

652
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,480
we had time to reflect on what we have

653
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
and what people feel is the important

654
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,240
way to go forward

655
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,279
we don't have to obsolete the current

656
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,720
spec

657
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,960
and we could progress with this work as

658
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,200
an adopted item it already is adopted or

659
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
we could do something and

660
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,360
slightly different but we should tackle

661
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,120
this at a future date and finish this

662
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,039
spec i would encourage magnus to

663
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,200
continue working on it so we can see

664
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,440
what the final spec looks like

665
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,000
would that be okay likeness

666
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,559
yeah yes from my perspective it's it's

667
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,640
fine to let's continue review it etc and

668
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,120
see that it works but and as i said we

669
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,360
have no problem removing the obsolete

670
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,200
683 if if

671
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
if that makes the working group more

672
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,679
happy from

673
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,279
because i think there's there's a

674
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,520
significant difference in capabilities

675
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,080
here which

676
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,480
yeah that is certainly one of the things

677
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,840
that we should consider at the next

678
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,679
meeting uh whether we should remove the

679
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,279
obsolete line

680
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,120
uh whether people are happy with this

681
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,080
progress

682
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,039
and i'd also like you to try and talk

683
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,360
about um who might implement this specs

684
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,440
so we can have some experience but who

685
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,600
will review it and implement it as we

686
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,120
get the document finished

687
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,799
is that okay like this

688
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,640
yeah yes

689
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,720
cool i thought you would say that that's

690
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,679
good um at that case any other questions

691
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,720
or we'll move on to the next draft

692
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,840
thank you magnus

693
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,000
so the next topic i think on my list is

694
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,440
udp options

695
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,240
so the udp options what we talked about

696
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,919
to the previous interim

697
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,480
um joel need to go chase slides wait a

698
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,600
minute here

699
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,840
yeah that's fine

700
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,440
joe attended that and he has a slide

701
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,840
deck that reviews some of the key

702
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,520
outcomes of that meeting

703
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,760
and talks about the work that remains

704
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,080
for udp options so

705
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,158
i shall present on behalf of geotouch

706
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,120
that's great

707
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,360
so this is the view from joel tuch's

708
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,120
window the view from my window is

709
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,720
complete darkness

710
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,679
and

711
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,120
yeah we're in different places um

712
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,880
i'm going to present on behalf of joe so

713
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,000
next slide if we can

714
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,080
on here

715
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,360
there we go

716
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,880
so the first

717
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,600
the first slide um here is about an

718
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,200
update from the interim in september

719
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,640
um at which we discussed the ocs option

720
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,840
and

721
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,279
important changes that emerged were

722
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,840
discussed as options on this mailing

723
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,520
list previously

724
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,080
and finally appeared in the text of the

725
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,120
id

726
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,840
one of those is a fixed position for the

727
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,000
ocs option and it's allocated in a place

728
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,600
which is now

729
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,039
visible and easily passable

730
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,559
and the unsafe option was changed

731
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,879
and

732
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,919
really is an option that only exists

733
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,039
behind the frag options so um

734
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,360
this note is quite clear in the

735
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,600
text and please check if that was one of

736
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,760
the concerns that you raised and the

737
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,960
frag option

738
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,120
has been rewritten

739
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,200
re-scoped

740
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,320
and really given a major overhaul which

741
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,919
started at the interim in september

742
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,320
and more about the frag option changes

743
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,559
in the next slides next slide

744
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,799
so the frag option

745
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,520
is the first option after the ocs is

746
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,799
given a

747
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,960
fixed position after the fixed position

748
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,039
of the rcs

749
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,279
um this was largely in response to

750
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,200
comments originally coming from tom

751
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,240
herbert

752
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,039
um which was trying to look at how easy

753
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,799
this would be to offload in the future

754
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,760
so placing it in a fixed position

755
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,240
would likely make that an easier job to

756
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,279
solve

757
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,600
for offload

758
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,000
each fragment includes per fragment

759
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,840
options that are placed before the data

760
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,000
and these options relate to every

761
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,720
datagram in

762
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,600
every ip packet carrying a part of the

763
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,559
datagram that's an ip fragment

764
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,720
and they're things like the ocs which

765
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,440
are always present

766
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,840
there's also the possibility of having

767
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,679
per

768
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,840
reassembled datagram

769
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,720
options and they appear at the end of

770
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,960
the

771
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,919
reassembled datagram in other words in

772
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,559
the same place as any other udp options

773
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,640
data

774
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,880
so it reassembles into the legacy format

775
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,080
next slide

776
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,120
the

777
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,000
idea of an mrss was brought up at the

778
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,760
interim um

779
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,799
and talked about there the i this is a

780
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,559
maximum value

781
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,919
of

782
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,720
payload that can be present in a udp

783
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,480
datagram

784
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,200
it's a number that's just chosen it's

785
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
chosen to reflect something larger than

786
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,120
the typical mtu

787
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,480
and

788
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,720
various numbers were speculated about in

789
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,440
the interim a mailing list afterwards

790
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,559
and joe finally chose the value 3000 as

791
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,000
the default expectation that a receiver

792
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,679
could reassemble

793
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,640
a datagram which had a payload of 3 000

794
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,720
bytes

795
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,320
it's designed to be

796
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,519
big enough

797
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,000
so that um you can get a sizeable

798
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,240
benefit but not too large that it claims

799
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,960
lots of memory in the stack

800
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,360
when it's implemented

801
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,279
the

802
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,720
requirement for receivers was discussed

803
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,080
and the current id has a requirement for

804
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,679
all receivers to support reassembly of

805
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,480
two fragments the udp datagram

806
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,919
so a receiver that complies with the

807
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,960
internet draft will be able to take a

808
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,399
datagram

809
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,320
that has been fragmented into two parts

810
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,640
reassemble those into a hall

811
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,320
and this will give you

812
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,399
effectively the ability to traverse a

813
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,440
tunnel or to send um larger than 1500

814
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,679
bytes

815
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,159
the limit of two was added for

816
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,600
simplicity of implementation if you only

817
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,480
had two fragments it was argued that

818
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,120
maybe the receiver could be less

819
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,840
vulnerable to attacks the code would be

820
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,600
simpler and probably more efficient

821
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,640
the actual fragment size that will be

822
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,600
supported is a function of both the size

823
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,840
of

824
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,159
the underlying udp packets you can send

825
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,519
across the path

826
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,720
that's the

827
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,559
that's the ip packet size and the mrss

828
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,360
so if we go to the next slide

829
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,600
you'll see the various calculations

830
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,840
which

831
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,040
basically give mass to say that the

832
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,760
amount you can expect a receiver to

833
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,599
reassemble

834
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,879
without any information extra than the

835
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,520
spec would be for two fragments and the

836
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,879
two fragments

837
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,839
together must be less than 3 000 bytes

838
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,359
of reassembled payload

839
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,879
and of course all of this could be

840
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,000
changed if you negotiate the mrss option

841
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,560
so there's an mrss option as well which

842
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,119
lets you reassemble more fragments and

843
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,839
larger size and

844
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,918
these slides have really gone through

845
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:44,800
the

846
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,960
expectation of the default behavior of a

847
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,800
receiver that complies with the spec

848
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,399
so next slide i think just says what i

849
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,560
said

850
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,119
this is a a check on whether those

851
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,640
people who were involved in this

852
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,960
discussion or anyone else who wants to

853
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,520
know past comment has opinions about

854
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,560
this design choice of two fragments

855
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,480
and the three thousand bytes total

856
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,160
and otherwise apart from this joe

857
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,920
believes he's answered

858
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,079
all the issues which were previously

859
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,920
haunting the spec as we went through the

860
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,359
various revisions

861
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,400
um wanting lots of different um

862
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,560
topics to be addressed joe believes he's

863
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,359
now

864
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,839
only got consistency to address and is

865
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,400
now willing to take more comments um

866
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,720
from the list so

867
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,560
um

868
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,480
that's the last slide comments please

869
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,839
mike you should go first

870
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,200
um um i would say that there are at

871
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,240
least two more issues that uh

872
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,640
need to be resolved uh

873
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,800
one of them is that we don't have

874
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,000
um

875
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,200
a mechanism uh spelled out in the

876
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,720
specification for uh sending pad

877
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,920
padding packets that are uh

878
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,040
required for a

879
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,720
datagram

880
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,839
p

881
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,880
plm tud

882
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,040
uh it's not something that would require

883
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,800
another option it's uh merely

884
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,839
a means for the uh upper layer protocol

885
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,960
to uh be able to specify that uh

886
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,400
uh a uh packet is inflated

887
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,599
uh up to a certain length with uh zeros

888
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:38,800
on the end

889
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,320
a second uh major concern that i have is

890
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,839
per fragment options having them at all

891
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,240
i think that is a very significant and

892
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,839
unnecessary and undesirable

893
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,560
uh complication on the spec and i will

894
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,280
take

895
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,240
uh the details about this uh complaint

896
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,920
uh to the list

897
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,880
uh and leave my comments there thank you

898
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,160
yeah please do i i'm not joe um

899
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,400
but i would like to apply a one per

900
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,520
fragment option which is the ocs which

901
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,440
is probably needed for traversal of a

902
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,400
nut

903
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,640
all right

904
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,440
yeah right thanks

905
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,280
so so we should we should take that to

906
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,960
the list i've made enough of those two

907
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,680
issues and on to david please

908
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,839
i'm simply uh want to speak up to

909
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,160
support um the uh conclusion on udp mrss

910
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,000
i think two fragments is a good is a

911
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,119
good design choice because uh it cleanly

912
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,640
addresses the tunnel forces from uh uh

913
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,400
fragmentation case which is one of the

914
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,839
things that this draft's about to solve

915
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,400
okay thanks david

916
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,960
i'm wait um one of the things i was

917
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,200
encouraging with my chair cut on

918
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,359
was really for anybody who expects to

919
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,079
use this please come along and tell us

920
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,400
either tell the chairs or speak up on

921
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,320
the list and say what it is you're

922
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,800
expecting from this draft

923
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,160
and

924
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,160
use cases are really good for testing

925
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,599
whether we've got all the features we

926
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,720
have in the right places

927
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,880
so the next set of slides will be

928
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,240
presented by

929
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,720
tom who's responsible for this little

930
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,400
bit of work go ahead tom

931
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,320
nice try gary you're you're involved too

932
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,920
uh hi i'm i'm tom jones um this is our

933
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,880
document that describes uh dplp m2d for

934
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,800
udp options or i think udpodplpmtud

935
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,400
as we were talking about in transport

936
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,359
earlier

937
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,640
um it's a small document that

938
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,160
adds the necessary features for udp

939
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,920
options um

940
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,240
intended to be an example for how to

941
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,119
write small documents like this

942
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,560
if you have more questions you can ask

943
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
magnus he asked for the document

944
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,480
it does a couple of very simple things

945
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,359
it adds cdp options the ability to do

946
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,599
the required features for you for dplp

947
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,320
m2d so you can do confirmation of

948
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,000
connectivity

949
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,079
um we can send probes we can validate

950
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,760
the path and we can do um ptp handling

951
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,920
and it's nice and short it's seven pages

952
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,200
um

953
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,520
since the the last revision the document

954
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,320
was um adopted there are some temporal

955
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,160
ordering issues between the adoption and

956
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,960
the

957
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,599
zero zero because i was on holiday

958
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,359
um and so if i have the next slide

959
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,280
um and so that gives us the the next

960
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,160
steps so we missed one which was text on

961
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,839
generating padding so i think we still

962
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,160
have text saying you can use knocks

963
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,200
and this is

964
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,280
um forbidden by udp options this is fine

965
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,000
because you can create padding by adding

966
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,520
zero bytes to the end of the packet and

967
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,359
we're actually happy with this method

968
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,920
uh we need to do an editorial pass gory

969
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,400
claims there's lots of typos um so i'm

970
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,160
waiting for a pull request but we need

971
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,599
to go through and be very thorough on

972
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,480
this

973
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,280
um we need text now to explain how dplp

974
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,040
m2d works with fragments now that

975
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,319
fragments are starting to settle down

976
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,680
and

977
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,119
because we're getting happier with the

978
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,359
design and then we'd really like to get

979
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,440
more comments from the working group

980
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,800
because it's the way to move the

981
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,400
document we expect this to complete

982
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,960
alongside udp options um and i think

983
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,400
once we've done the the first couple of

984
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,319
things listed here the document will

985
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,960
mostly be a maintenance mode until

986
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,839
um udp options is is is ready in the

987
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,280
working group and we'll just have to

988
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,880
track what joe changes as joe changes

989
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,640
things so that we stay in sync

990
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,118
and that's all

991
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,599
so i'm

992
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,000
willing to give up time for questions on

993
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,640
this because it's been adopted

994
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,319
um relatively recently and we'd like to

995
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,960
ensure that it can also be working group

996
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,160
last cold soon so that it and coincides

997
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,960
with the publication of udp options does

998
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,599
anybody have any

999
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:05,319
questions about the presentation by tom

1000
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,040
i would simply comment that the

1001
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,200
underlying mechanism here received quite

1002
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,359
a bit of review when it was part of the

1003
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,839
original uh dplp mtud so this is not new

1004
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,480
material and the algorithm is understood

1005
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,040
and stable

1006
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,240
yeah and this draft although it's kind

1007
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,480
of only just become a working group item

1008
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,079
has been around the working group and

1009
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,640
presented a number of times in the past

1010
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,520
so there have not been major changes in

1011
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,760
between these two it's just that we've

1012
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,520
now reached the stage of this document

1013
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,960
needing review from people

1014
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,119
well um when do you think we can make a

1015
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,160
new copy tom

1016
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
in this next week

1017
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,160
yeah yeah

1018
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,200
in the next month we can have another

1019
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,960
copy it's not it's not a problem there's

1020
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,160
a small amount of things to do so it

1021
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,560
should be quite straightforward

1022
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,119
okay

1023
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,440
does anybody wish to add

1024
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,400
any comment or questions on this before

1025
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,640
we close

1026
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,520
then i'll say thank you ever so much for

1027
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,720
tom coming to speak on our joint draft

1028
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,800
right um

1029
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,640
sorry for the speed at which we're going

1030
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,040
through this meeting but um it's good

1031
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,599
that we're keeping to time and the next

1032
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,880
talk will be by mike but no

1033
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,440
marcus on mpdccp so um without any more

1034
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,440
introduction would you like to update us

1035
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,880
on version two of your

1036
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,280
document

1037
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,079
yeah hello everyone for sure i'm happy

1038
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,839
to update you on the progress we made on

1039
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,359
mpdcp maybe starting with some general

1040
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,040
updates so we received a working group

1041
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,240
adoption in august this year

1042
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,800
so quite recently we are focusing now on

1043
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,319
maturity towards working group last call

1044
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,240
ideally this is alive with the timeline

1045
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,800
in 3gp release 18 because there it is

1046
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,119
already discussed as an eight as part of

1047
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,520
an anticlockwise and enhancement and the

1048
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,920
discussion is currently in the

1049
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,520
phase uh

1050
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,480
that

1051
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,319
they have i think a december to conclude

1052
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,960
if this goes for study item

1053
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,560
approval

1054
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,520
um

1055
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,920
we also interfaced uh where we now start

1056
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,839
discussions with with industry with

1057
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,880
vendors um to go for drawing testbed and

1058
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,960
implementation activities

1059
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,960
that's going on and we have some quite

1060
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,040
interesting discussions around that so i

1061
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,000
will you keep posted on that

1062
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,560
and we also in the face of

1063
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,520
next open source version we still plan

1064
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,800
to publish

1065
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,560
end of this year

1066
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,520
aligned with the latest draft updates

1067
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,760
and also provide a much better

1068
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,000
performance

1069
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,520
the draft development is ongoing at

1070
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,760
github with currently eight contributors

1071
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,920
we have an established process uh with

1072
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,640
issue tracker and pull request uh used

1073
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,960
for reviews and and updates next slide

1074
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,680
please marcus what what's the timing you

1075
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,440
need on this uh to align with 3gpp

1076
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,079
release 18.

1077
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,640
i think it would be good to

1078
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,079
have maybe you're working through plus

1079
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,200
call then end of next year maybe that

1080
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,920
fits ideally

1081
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,920
but that requires that it becomes a

1082
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,079
study item approval for sure so that is

1083
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,839
the decision which will be made end of

1084
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,240
this year

1085
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,839
in 3gbp

1086
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,839
um

1087
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,560
yeah two weeks ago we published

1088
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,400
the first version of the

1089
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,040
working group adoption in that

1090
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,839
we

1091
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,640
updated multiple things

1092
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,520
though

1093
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,680
we defined a reliable exchange of

1094
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,760
multi-path options for those options

1095
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,760
where it is needed

1096
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,599
we have a consistent description of

1097
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,040
multi-part reordering so we used uh or

1098
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,960
we described multi-parts we were

1099
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,359
reordering issues as part of the trough

1100
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,560
we use diff we use different terms for

1101
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,240
describing reordering reordering

1102
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,319
reassembly and so on so they made all of

1103
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,240
this consistent

1104
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,040
then

1105
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,280
we added a very important

1106
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,240
section from our review on fallback

1107
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,160
strategies so what is going to happen if

1108
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,160
a multi-path

1109
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,560
cannot be established

1110
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,640
so for example then we it could be

1111
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,720
trigger to fall back to single path dccp

1112
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,480
we introduced the number of authors to

1113
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,720
be compliant with the rfc editor style

1114
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,839
guide

1115
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:56,560
and we made some minor editorial things

1116
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,359
if you're interested you can look into

1117
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:00,800
in the

1118
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,359
latest version we published this week uh

1119
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,480
we made

1120
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,720
a lot of progress on describing a new

1121
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,319
hand checking procedure

1122
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,839
along with authentication capabilities

1123
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,440
um to

1124
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,400
guarantee a safe establishment of

1125
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,160
subsequent flows i will come to this in

1126
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,760
the next slide

1127
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,560
also some major work we did on defining

1128
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,680
or enhancing the multi-path prior option

1129
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,280
for fine granular steering of past

1130
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,839
priorities backup and disable part that

1131
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,480
goes far beyond the mp prior definition

1132
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,480
from mptcp

1133
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,960
last but not least we improved

1134
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,480
the operational section of the draft

1135
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,520
next slide please

1136
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,720
yeah now coming to an um interesting

1137
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,359
topic which we which i also started to

1138
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,240
discuss on the mailing list i shared the

1139
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,200
link in the chat now

1140
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,200
let me explain how

1141
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,599
we defined so far the hand checking

1142
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,920
procedure and how we improved it

1143
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,319
uh so on the left you see the initial

1144
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,640
approach we had in the draft

1145
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,280
it's a three-way approach we call it

1146
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,040
because first of all we establish

1147
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,760
the multipath connection over one link

1148
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,960
that you see

1149
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,240
from a1 to b1 it's a three by hand track

1150
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,559
as i indicated already

1151
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,280
in that one we negotiate the multi-pass

1152
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,800
capabilities we negotiate key material

1153
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,920
for later

1154
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,040
uh a subsequent flow establishment

1155
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,480
and so on

1156
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,599
um

1157
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,480
so after the multi-part connection

1158
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,160
is established so the three-way

1159
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,640
handshake was successful it is safe to

1160
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,599
join subsequent flows the issues what

1161
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,880
you can see here is the mp join

1162
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,839
which is sent from a2 to b1

1163
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,839
arrives too early

1164
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,880
at the host b and overtakes the final

1165
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,520
bccp

1166
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,440
acknowledgement from the initial flow

1167
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,040
then there's some confusion because the

1168
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,720
multi-pass connection

1169
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,960
has not been successfully established

1170
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,040
the mp joint tries to

1171
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,119
join something which is not available

1172
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,000
and

1173
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,880
in our open source implementation we

1174
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,079
then react with the dccp reset on that

1175
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,400
flow which means the subsequent flow

1176
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,079
cannot be established

1177
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,000
that is not what we want

1178
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,040
that's why we drive to improve this

1179
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,960
in the draft as well as in the open

1180
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,640
source implementation we are currently

1181
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,400
working now on implementing what we

1182
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,400
propose on the right side and what is

1183
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,720
already part of the draft so

1184
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,920
we extended the three-way handshake by

1185
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,119
an additional acknowledgement we

1186
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,400
sent from the host b to the host a

1187
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,400
with that we know

1188
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,119
that the multipath connection has been

1189
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,160
initiated successfully and it's safe

1190
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,599
then to start the joint procedure

1191
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,079
from a2 to b1

1192
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,240
uh it's a it's a simple solution it

1193
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,480
works we could be happy with that

1194
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,640
however we wonder if this can be

1195
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,720
optimized because it adds additional

1196
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,800
delay and also it has a high dependency

1197
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,559
that all the four messages of the

1198
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,359
initial flow will arrive

1199
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,040
that's why

1200
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,119
we come to some proposals on the next

1201
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,440
slide

1202
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,760
starting again on the left

1203
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,200
and what we could do to optimize this we

1204
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,800
could again go to a three-way approach

1205
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,880
as it was before

1206
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,160
however

1207
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,400
we do not check

1208
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,559
when we send the mp join and the amp

1209
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:45,040
transfer arrives at host b

1210
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,440
if the multipath connection is already

1211
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,240
established we do it at a later point

1212
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,880
with the final dccp economic

1213
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,599
acknowledgement of the join process that

1214
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,160
gives us more time

1215
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,720
or that gives the whole establishment

1216
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,839
process more time that the initial flow

1217
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,960
is successfully established however

1218
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,720
that only works

1219
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,880
if there is

1220
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,920
not a too big latency difference between

1221
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,839
both paths

1222
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,040
otherwise we run into the same issue

1223
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,119
as i introduced

1224
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,920
um in the previous slide

1225
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,680
that's why we also do not prefer this

1226
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,280
however it's a valid solution and we are

1227
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,280
happy to discover this with you

1228
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,839
uh the preferred solution or the optimal

1229
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,240
solution bc is on the right

1230
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,520
uh because that reduce the latency of

1231
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,720
the establishment process or the whole

1232
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,920
time of the establishment process and it

1233
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,240
uses the dependency on the initial flow

1234
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,800
so what we propose is more or less to go

1235
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,640
for a

1236
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,400
two-way a reliable two-way handshake

1237
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,960
and what we also do in implementation is

1238
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,359
we already create all the necessary

1239
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,160
multi-parts structures in the network

1240
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,160
stack after the first dccp request

1241
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,680
arrives at host b

1242
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,559
um

1243
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:15,440
then we reply to this

1244
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,400
from host b2 to host a

1245
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,680
we have ensured that with this

1246
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,000
these two messages all the key material

1247
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,240
is exchanged which is required

1248
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,079
um to derive the tokens and hmax

1249
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,880
for a subsequent flow establishment

1250
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,280
that means we are not reliant

1251
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,440
anymore on the final dccp

1252
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,520
acknowledgement of the initial flow so

1253
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,559
this one can even fail and it has no

1254
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,079
impact because

1255
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,680
the mp joint process

1256
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,680
can

1257
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,920
a subsequent flow and can even establish

1258
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,280
the whole multi-part connection

1259
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,720
so that is a

1260
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,160
big change

1261
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,040
in the

1262
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,119
design principle of the of the hand

1263
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,880
checking procedure

1264
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,800
and

1265
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,000
we want to put the question here if this

1266
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,920
is a good proposal does it make sense

1267
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,440
or do we raise raise issues

1268
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,280
like

1269
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,480
providing a tech surface for daniel of

1270
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,559
service attacks because we create

1271
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,480
multi-pass structures already in the

1272
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,800
beginning

1273
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,160
or

1274
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,359
or do we raise security

1275
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,440
issues with that

1276
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,480
um

1277
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,079
yeah that is the point i would like to

1278
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:38,319
discuss today with you uh coming with

1279
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,480
that to the last slide

1280
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,280
so your review is very very much

1281
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,680
appreciated and it would really help us

1282
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,119
to move forward

1283
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:47,920
so

1284
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,839
yeah with that

1285
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,319
i am finished for today and happy now to

1286
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:55,040
get your feedback

1287
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,000
thank you for the

1288
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,520
update that was very helpful

1289
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,599
when do you think

1290
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,200
you would have

1291
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,839
more information about the options and

1292
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:10,319
the design considerations that you just

1293
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:13,520
spoke about i'm wondering whether a

1294
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,839
another meeting focused on

1295
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,920
specific points would actually be a

1296
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,839
better focus for bringing in other

1297
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:22,160
people into discussing this do you think

1298
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,760
that you might have

1299
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,079
information about that in the near term

1300
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,040
so it depends on on what you expect so

1301
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,079
if it is just a presentation to make a

1302
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,319
deep dive into the issues then i think

1303
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,480
we can go quickly for that

1304
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,880
if you expect to have those different

1305
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,599
designs implemented somewhere and then

1306
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,839
it maybe takes a longer time

1307
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,599
or it will not be possible at all

1308
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,160
because we do not plan to to implement

1309
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,079
them before we have the discussion with

1310
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,240
with the itf community

1311
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,440
i mean i

1312
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,400
i i don't expect you to implement all

1313
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,839
the options and then come back and tell

1314
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,240
us which one was the most painful

1315
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,800
and that's clearly not the right way and

1316
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,880
so you might need to take a little bit

1317
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,040
of decision yourself about which way you

1318
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,440
think might work and see if that is

1319
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,599
actually feasible to implement

1320
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,839
and then at that point it might be great

1321
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,480
to bring in more people and go slowly

1322
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,079
through what you think might be the

1323
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:21,920
security questions and the protocol

1324
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,119
questions

1325
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,359
and we could do that in a interim

1326
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:28,079
meeting perhaps dedicated to this

1327
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,640
yeah um but i would prefer and fully

1328
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,960
support to go for interim

1329
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,359
maybe we can combine it with one of the

1330
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:37,680
other topics like http but up to you

1331
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,280
what you think is best or having a

1332
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,440
separate interim uh yeah happy to

1333
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,960
support this and i think we can go

1334
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,480
quickly for that

1335
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,640
in the meantime we have a question from

1336
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,839
chang

1337
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:49,760
kanji

1338
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,640
uh yes checking here um i don't have

1339
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,440
solution uh comments for your

1340
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,799
your uh strategy here but what i know is

1341
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:01,920
currently in essay 2 3gpp working group

1342
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,400
it's talking about atss

1343
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,040
for phase 3 for release 18.

1344
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,839
so it discussed the

1345
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:11,200
possibility to provide more than two

1346
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,799
passes actually like uh two three gtp

1347
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,599
passes or two non-switch differences

1348
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,000
so here you are talking about only two

1349
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,480
passes here so have you ever thought

1350
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,599
about like three or more okay that that

1351
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,760
is a yeah uh thank you for this question

1352
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,520
i'm fully aware of this discussion in

1353
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,920
3gpp and i think it's a misunderstanding

1354
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,280
when i

1355
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,640
presented today the figures of the

1356
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,160
handshaking process that are very

1357
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,160
generic figures that does not mean that

1358
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,559
we are limited to two flows um

1359
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,400
it's the opposite uh so we support an

1360
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,280
unlimited number of

1361
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,680
okay thank flows

1362
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,480
thank you right okay um we will talk

1363
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,880
more about this on the mailing list

1364
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,359
and if a meeting is what's required to

1365
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,200
facilitate something we will arrange an

1366
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,119
interim meeting for this

1367
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,200
and the next one will be greg who um

1368
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,119
has already tried once to be on the

1369
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,119
agenda and now gets the chance for the

1370
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,599
last five minutes of this particular

1371
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,920
meeting so greg you have only five

1372
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,599
minutes and

1373
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,280
do something useful please to tell us

1374
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,880
about enqueue

1375
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,880
all right um

1376
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,720
i'll skip past the first few slides

1377
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,960
which are just status um

1378
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,040
in fact that one i um is a list of

1379
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,720
changes in draft 08 that i sent to the

1380
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,079
mailing list so that's already been

1381
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,040
shared

1382
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,240
i'd like to spend a little bit of time

1383
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,760
on this one

1384
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,000
so this is a current discussion on the

1385
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,799
mailing list about

1386
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:41,359
nqb sender requirements and guidance on

1387
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,520
sender rates

1388
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,040
the top paragraph in yellow um describes

1389
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,319
in informative language what an nqb flow

1390
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,400
is and it describes it as sending at

1391
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,280
most a few well-spaced packets per rtt

1392
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,960
i'm going to give some examples of in

1393
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,880
today's network

1394
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,359
no more than one relatively large packet

1395
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:04,319
every 10 milliseconds

1396
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,160
roughly a megabit per second

1397
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,119
the next paragraph then in green

1398
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,040
points out that

1399
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,079
um just marking your packets as nqb

1400
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,559
doesn't get you off the hook in terms of

1401
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,160
implementing

1402
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,200
all of the

1403
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,880
expected features to make your

1404
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,480
application safe on the internet

1405
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,319
including

1406
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:25,760
some sort of congestion control or

1407
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,280
congestion response

1408
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,280
um and uh

1409
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,240
or circuit breaker um functionalities

1410
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,680
that sort of thing

1411
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,720
um and then the last paragraph is where

1412
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,240
um it provides a specific recommendation

1413
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,160
around not marking traffic as nqb

1414
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,599
based on

1415
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:46,720
the uh

1416
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,640
the sending rate and and the current

1417
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:53,680
text in that kind of blue green uh color

1418
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,680
if the traffic exceeds more than a few

1419
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,720
packets per rtt or exceeds approximately

1420
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,319
one megabit per second on an

1421
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,640
instantaneous inner packet basis

1422
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,240
um the application should not mark its

1423
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,920
traffic

1424
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,400
and the next slide then we can go to

1425
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,000
that

1426
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,240
uh

1427
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,319
there's was some discussion on the

1428
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:17,040
mailing list around um that one megabit

1429
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,200
per second number in the requirement

1430
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,640
statement

1431
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,920
and will that stand the test of time um

1432
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,880
maybe it would be better to base that on

1433
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,680
something that um that evolves over time

1434
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,680
and suggestion was

1435
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,920
something like 10

1436
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,960
of the global average access link

1437
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,640
capacity at the time

1438
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,000
and then

1439
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,160
and then adding an example

1440
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,760
at the time of writing

1441
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,319
what that might be and a link to

1442
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,880
where those numbers came from

1443
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,040
and then at the end it does the math for

1444
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,319
you uh and it says a very typical server

1445
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:55,920
application

1446
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,799
that implies no more than 6.3 megabits

1447
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:01,680
per second at an instantaneous rate

1448
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,400
and for a typical client application no

1449
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,640
more than 1.3 megabits

1450
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,880
and here the

1451
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,720
um

1452
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,319
because interpretation of a typical

1453
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:13,680
server is

1454
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,680
effectively a server or an application

1455
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,280
that is

1456
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,880
it's not aware whether it's sending

1457
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,359
traffic over a mobile access network or

1458
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,359
a fixed access network

1459
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:26,160
um and so it's the lower of the two um

1460
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,079
but it's pretty certain it's not sending

1461
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,079
traffic in the upstream direction on an

1462
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:31,920
access network it's almost really

1463
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,680
sending in the downstream direction and

1464
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,319
then for the client it takes the uh

1465
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,720
the view that it's um almost certainly

1466
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,839
sending traffic in the upstream

1467
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:41,839
direction on an access network

1468
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:44,160
and uh but again may not know whether

1469
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,440
it's mobile or effect so it takes the

1470
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,960
lower of the two

1471
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,480
questions working group on that um

1472
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:54,160
are we happy with this with scaling the

1473
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,440
recommendation over time based on

1474
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,160
statistics that are available um at the

1475
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,280
time

1476
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,440
um we'll need to take that to the list

1477
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,559
um i'm concerned that you're using

1478
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:08,799
average across a distribution that's

1479
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:10,960
non-uniform but this is not the place to

1480
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,359
split uh to go to dive into the the

1481
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,880
statistics

1482
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,280
yeah okay um

1483
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,599
uh and then moving on to the next slide

1484
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:22,480
then just quickly um

1485
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,760
i think that's been discussed on the

1486
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,520
mailing list actually just maybe the

1487
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,280
following slide

1488
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,359
um

1489
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,760
a question from my anna um

1490
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,000
what should these nq these dsps be

1491
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,400
labeled in the iana registry um should

1492
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,559
they both be called non-cue building i

1493
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,400
mean we should label them separately

1494
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,760
again we can discuss that on the mailing

1495
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,160
list and the last slide

1496
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,400
yeah we need to fix this

1497
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,960
last i once once these edits have been

1498
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,520
made and we've settled on those um i'm

1499
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,960
hoping we can go to working group last

1500
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,480
call and i want to get a sense from the

1501
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,400
chairs as to

1502
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,760
if that would be

1503
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,000
advisable to try to start a working

1504
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,480
group last call

1505
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,400
in the interim before the next idea

1506
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,839
i think it's worth drink trying to work

1507
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:11,599
in robust course shortly after the first

1508
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,520
the year the other card i'd make on this

1509
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,960
is that your your light blue should text

1510
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,760
about should not use for high bandwidth

1511
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,599
um

1512
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:24,000
i need to redirect in detail um there's

1513
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,920
going to need to be some teeth behind

1514
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,920
that something that if the sender does

1515
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,480
that um the network that the network is

1516
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,280
entitled to uh to to evict the track

1517
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,599
evict that flow of mqb

1518
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:36,720
yeah

1519
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,839
okay fair enough

1520
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:47,000
i can add that to the list

1521
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:58,920
i see a poll has been started

1522
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,200
so my fault i started the poll then i

1523
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,200
realized you can't press the mic button

1524
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,880
where you press the pull

1525
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,799
but at least um

1526
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:26,799
i'd be interested in getting people to

1527
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:28,400
read this

1528
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,480
recent version of the spec or the

1529
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,799
current version of the spec and see how

1530
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:35,839
near we are um i can't really answer

1531
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,119
whether we need

1532
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,839
more time or not um

1533
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:43,039
please look at it on the list and tell

1534
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:45,839

1535
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:48,640
thank you greg and david

1536
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,480
wears do we have anything else that we

1537
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,839
should say

1538
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:52,559
i

1539
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,880
i have one more presentation cued from

1540
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,760
anna castura and i think anna's going to

1541
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,160
have been caught by the time

1542
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,440
so um we'll take that next meeting

1543
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,599
and anything else from my co-chairs as

1544
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:08,160
we finish

1545
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:14,799
a good move here as that

1546
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:17,440
that that that needs some that needs

1547
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,400
some discussion about content and

1548
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,319
i mean we we know something in the space

1549
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:23,520
is useful how we're going to figure out

1550
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,240
exactly what

1551
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:30,960
that's fine and i i pled to place um a

1552
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,960
standing offer to anna to present more

1553
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,119
data if she has any to the next meeting

1554
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:36,160
and

1555
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,839
we will try and clarify what goes in

1556
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:40,000
that document

1557
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,839
any of the final comments perhaps from

1558
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:43,920
where's on session one if you're still

1559
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,400
there with

1560
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,720
uh i don't have anything myself

1561
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,079
excellent

1562
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,559
martin you should take note of the

1563
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:57,119
multi-path dccp

1564
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,000
relationship to 3gpp that will

1565
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,599
eventually surface in liaison

1566
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:04,160
discussions

1567
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,480
yeah roger that like i mean i think if

1568
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,799
if um

1569
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:10,720
if it's not picked up a study i might i

1570
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,640
think we need to reevaluate

1571
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,720
what we're doing

1572
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,400
for sure

1573
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,839
sure

1574
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:19,440
and

1575
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,599
my final thing is i expect there to be

1576
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,160
an interim before the next meeting

1577
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,720
so please keep a note out for that if

1578
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,319
you have things that you think should

1579
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:30,079
appear on the agenda of that interim

1580
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:33,119
please contact the chairs

1581
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,440
otherwise we will hope to see you at the

1582
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,440
interim or in person perhaps at the next

1583
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,000
ietf meeting

1584
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,200
that's all for today

1585
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,760

1586
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,319
