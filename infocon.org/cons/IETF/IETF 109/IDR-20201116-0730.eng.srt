1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,040
for your last presentation was perfect

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,200
yeah so you know what i did i at the

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,838
very end when i

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,640
all i did was i i took off my headphones

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,880
and i just

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,240
sat close to the laptop trying to get my

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,880
head as close to the laptop as possible

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,198
so you're like eating the laptop it

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,198
worked

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,119
yeah but it would have been nice if i

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,599
could get my headphones to work but it

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,519
but

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,960
so when i did that it sounded fairly

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,440
clear like right now how does it sound

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,000
it's better than it was when you started

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,599
okay

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,520
i think i was talking a little lower

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,120
like i gotta talk a little bit higher

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,680
i guess that's the ball and then i just

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,680
feel better

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:58,000
all right well i guess i'll build it

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:01:01,039
glad we got that debugged ish anyway

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,239
right well it's uh it's the half hour

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,360
so uh let's get this thing on the road

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:13,040
um yeah live live from michigan it's

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:15,520
late night with idr

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,119
so we got we we have two sessions this

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,119
week we've got this one

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,320
uh which is just an hour and then we've

30
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,400
got a longer one

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,520
on friday and because this one is short

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,439
we are not going to spend a lot of time

33
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,880
um sue and i are not going to spend a

34
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,119
lot of time listening to ourselves talk

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,280
uh you get to see the note well because

36
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,720
you get to see it every time

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,159
and as usual

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,920
it's uh up to you to know that when you

39
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,759
uh

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,240
when you join one of these meetings at

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,399
some point um

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,880
whether you remember it or not you did

43
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,159
sign a piece of click wrap that said

44
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,880
that you

45
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,680
will abide by you know all these various

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,600
rules so

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,280
if you don't know what they are maybe

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,559
you should go check

49
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,640
uh in particular they pertain to

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,039
disclosing any ipr that you know of but

51
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,799
there's other stuff in there too

52
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:18,079
um and there's all the references and

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,120
uh if you need legal counsel

54
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,280
i'm not it um

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,640
so uh you know where to find the

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,000
materials

57
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,399
uh you definitely know where to find the

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,800
meat echo because you're here

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,360
um if you want to help with the notes

60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,360
that's where

61
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,239
and here's our agenda for today and like

62

i said i'm not going to spend

63
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,040
a lot of time talking we're just going

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,440

65
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,959

questions we will do a longer

68
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,920
chairs thing on on friday because we

69
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,920

seeing no one in the queue um

71
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,519
[Music]

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,399
who who's our presenter for for the

73
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,840
first one is it

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,840

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,519
okay uh hello idr

79
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,399
uh and we won from china telecom i'm

80
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,360
going to

81
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,000
introduce our revision of the draft

82
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,840
after

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,840
a last meeting next page please

84
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,400
based on the previous discussion

85
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,360
we made the following changes we

86
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,080
add the description of the limitations

87
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,360
of

88
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,560
existing solutions we clarify

89
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,080
some previous unclear aspects of

90
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,920
rdrf mechanism and modify the

91
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:08,000
visceral mechanism of rdo rf

92
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:11,200
and we add the solution of rdrf

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
mechanism in the scenario of several

94
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,518
vrfs

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,720
in a pe import vpn routes

96
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,680
which carry the same rt

97
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,680
next page please

98
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:30,000
in this scenario pes

99
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,120
establish ibgp sessions with rr

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,960
to ensure the roots can be

101
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,160
transmitted within as100

102
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,280
where p124 maintain

103
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,639
weaken routine information and

104
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,919
r don't maintain any vrf's uh

105
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:54,479
the rdrf mechanism in

106
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:57,599
different devices is independent

107
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:01,599
once week of weapon one in

108
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,479
p1 overflows p1 will find out the main

109
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,560
source of

110
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:09,680
vpn routes in this prf

111
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,880
we assume it is p3 and

112
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,880
the overflow vpn routes rd is

113
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:20,080
rd1 and then p1 will

114
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,360
extracted p3s host address

115
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:27,520
and source rd from bgp

116
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:31,840
update message and generate a bgp

117
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:34,960
refresh message contains a rdrf entry

118
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:39,840
and send it to rr

119
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:43,120
next page please

120
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,159
but sometimes several vrf's in

121
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,759
a pe may import vpn rules

122
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,960
carry the same rt

123
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:56,160
in this scenario where f1 2

124
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,599
and 3 import vpn

125
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,800
rules contain rt3

126
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,160
these three vrfs have different maximum

127
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,240
prefix

128
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:11,840
once the vpn routes carry rd3

129
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:16,400
cause the overflow of the rf3

130
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:20,560
p will send a bgp root refresh message

131
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:24,239
contains a rdrf entry to r

132
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,080
then r will stop sending associated vpn

133
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,240
routes to p

134
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:33,599
however this will cause where f1 and 2

135
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,840
failing to receive vpn rules content are

136
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,600
distributed

137
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,719
the local determination of the pe

138
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,639
can be used to inhibit the

139
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:50,000
pe from sending rdrf entries

140
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:54,479
when the resources of the device

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,319
are not exhausted it only prevents the

142
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,840
overflowed vrf

143
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:03,680
from importing related vpn routes

144
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,719
without sending rdrf

145
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,720
next page please

146
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,680
when rr receives the root refresh

147
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,198
message

148
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,560
it texts the entry and adds it into

149
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:24,319
its adj rebound so that

150
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:28,000
r will stop sending vpn routes

151
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,440
contains rd1 to p1

152
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,120
if the processing capacity of r reaches

153
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,080
the limit

154
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,479
it will find out the appear that since

155
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,840
the

156
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:43,039
most routine entries to it

157
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:47,520
we assume it is p3 and the

158
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:51,360
overflow vpn boots rd is rd1

159
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,240
then rr will generate a bgp root refresh

160
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,400
message

161
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:59,759
containing a rdrf entry based on the

162
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:04,960
result of calculation and send it

163
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,960
to p3 next page please

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,759
when ps3 receives the root refresh

165
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,120
message

166
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:18,160
it checks the entry and adds it

167
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,759
into its edg rebound so that

168
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,639
p3 will stop sending associated vpn

169
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:28,080
routes to

170
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,080
rr and next next page

171
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,719
once the rdrf mechanism is triggered

172
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:42,800
the alarm information will be

173
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:46,880
generated and sent to the network

174
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:50,560
operators the operators should manually

175
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:54,560
configure the network to resume normal

176
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:58,000
operation after returning to normal

177
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,319
the device sends withdrawal rf entries

178
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,519
to

179
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,120
its peers who have previously

180
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:08,080
received rf entries then

181
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,360
the network operation will return to

182
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,040
normal

183
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,040
and next page please

184
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,719
okay the above is our revision

185
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:37,839
to this draft and any comments

186
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:37,839
to our work are welcome thank you

187
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,720
so if you're if there you know no

188
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,719
comment on the problem

189
00:09:48,839 --> 00:10:05,839
again others uncle after his media

190
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,600
all right talking to a to a closed mic

191
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,839
um i i wasn't able to understand what

192
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:39,040
you said earlier i john i'm sorry

193
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,040
um what i was going to say though is

194
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,640
you have a question adopt as a working

195
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,518
group document on your

196
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,360
um on your slide and i think that it

197
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,640
would be

198
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,040
at this point reasonable for us to to do

199
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,399
that

200
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:57,040
adoption call i will say that

201
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,760
you know sort of that the traffic on the

202
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,640
list

203
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,920
previously did provide quite a bit of

204
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,519
feedback that looked

205
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,680
mostly sort of

206
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:12,720
yeah we have discussed

207
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,839
this question on the list

208
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,959
for a long time and

209
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,959
the afterthought has

210
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:32,880
given answers to all the comments

211
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,880
okay uh ac please go ahead

212
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,560
yeah this is lacy lyndon francisco

213
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,920
i was going to say that yeah the

214
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,119
previous discussion

215
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:46,319
there was a lot of objection to using rd

216
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,680
for policy and i don't

217
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:53,519
see that that's changed so maybe that'll

218
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,519
come through in the adoption call

219
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,760
yeah we we have we have compared the

220
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:05,040
other solution with the rd policy

221
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:09,519
and then our solution is not suitable

222
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:13,360
for the current scenario so we still

223
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,360
selected the kind of protocol

224
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,320
here please go ahead

225
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,519
hi good morning can you hear me yeah i'm

226
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,040
clear

227
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,440
super so um i think i've been tracking

228
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,480
all the comments uh

229
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,519
i i still don't i still believe

230
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,200
rd based mechanisms are not useful

231
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,200
um i think i don't see

232
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,959
anything that has been drastically

233
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,560
changed that being said

234
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,959
maybe we can take this on the mailing

235
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,000
list and and hopefully can provide

236
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,000
another round of feedback

237
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:09,040
on the main list

238
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,399
any other questions comments uh you can

239
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:15,439
take yourself out of the queue now care

240
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,440
maybe i can take you out

241
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:25,200
okay uh thank you very much we will

242
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,839
take this up on the list and

243
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,839
next please

244
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:35,839
oh wait we have someone in the queue uh

245
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,839
giuseppe did you want to say something

246
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,079

247
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,079
in to present

248
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,839
you can just click on the mic to uh

249
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,839
start speaking

250
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,600
huh

251
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,680
giuseppe i see you um putting yourself

252
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,399
in the queue there you go

253
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,519
hello please go ahead yes we hear you

254
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,000
okay okay

255
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,800
uh sorry i put me in the queue but i i

256
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,399
had to

257
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,959
mute okay yeah good morning i'm going to

258
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,480
present

259
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,199
the update of the vgpsr quality

260
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:30,160
extension

261
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:33,199
to enable a heat so next

262
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:36,000
uh yeah just recap about background and

263
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,040
motivation for this graph so

264
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,560
uh density flow information telemetry

265
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:45,680
refers to data plane on path techniques

266
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:49,040
uh in particular uh we can mention all

267
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,279
inventory and alternate marking so

268
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,560
with the i feed terms we want to refer

269
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,279
to the

270
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,119
visual telemetry techniques with just a

271
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,920
single word

272
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,880
on the other hand the we have the sr

273
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,160
policy

274
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:07,760
that uh are identified

275
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,439
to the well-known tuple and an add-on

276
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,120
may be informed about the candidate

277
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:16,320
thought in different ways in particular

278
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,480
by pgp for example and

279
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,040
this document aims to define an

280
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,839
extension to bgp to distribute dsr

281
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,279
policies

282
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:28,079
carrying ip2 information and

283
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,079
i feed the information and in particular

284
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,638
in this way we want to enable

285
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,880
the inventory and alternate marking when

286
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,920
the sr policy is applied so this is the

287
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,959
scope

288
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,839
of of this graph

289
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,839
next

290
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,320
yeah in this slide we just recapped the

291
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,040
the changes

292
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,720
from the last version that was presented

293
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,839
that during the last

294
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,839
online meeting

295
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,560
now we are at 0-4 version we got some

296
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,839
comments during

297
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:07,040
the last ietf session from joel

298
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,480
and in this regard we clarified the use

299
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,199
of the ip terms

300
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,600
because there is something confusing

301
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,599
with

302
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,600
another document that is i think

303
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,880
framework so in this case

304
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,440
the ic terms is used just to

305
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,320
indicate the inventory and ultimate

306
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,360
marking

307
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,800
method so all the in c2 flow information

308
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,000
telemetry techniques that

309
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,399
also the acronyms say um

310
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,440
the other comment from catan was about

311
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,839
the

312
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,639
routing and control playing

313
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,120
considerations

314
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,079
we are also having an exchange image

315
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,759
just

316
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:45,359
uh in in the last days with katan to

317
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,079
clarify by the way

318
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,079
we try to address this comment but there

319
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,439
is something pending

320
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:56,560
that need to be clarified

321
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,480
we got also other inputs on the list

322
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:03,518
from quanan about how to handle

323
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,640
multiple multiple ip subtleties for

324
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,720
example

325
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,760
in this case we clarify that in

326
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:13,120
bandwagon and alternate marking cancels

327
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,119
or can also

328
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:21,520
be separated can be enabled on the

329
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:25,039
alternate marking on only uh in bandung

330
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:28,480
and vice versa the definition

331
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:31,600
of also jim give

332
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,160
a good comment here to define one

333
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,439
general

334
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,400
subtle v for ip and

335
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,760
we define the differentiate function as

336
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,880
sub sub plus

337
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,760
in this case it can be managed and

338
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,360
handled

339
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:50,720
in in an easy way

340
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,199
and also we improved on the section

341
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,240
about

342
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,480
dsr policy operation so

343
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,480
we

344
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,159
added more details about this operation

345
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,080
also based on the other compound

346
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,679
we can say the other document about the

347
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,000
tea policy

348
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,000
drafting idea so next

349
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,320
yeah uh yeah in this slide we just uh

350
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,440
explained that the feet attributes

351
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,918
can be attached at the candidate path

352
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,039
level

353
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,039
as a subtleties

354
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,719
yeah we also got a comment from you that

355
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,039
this figure

356
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,120
needs to be updated considering the

357
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,600
latest version of the

358
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,959
p policy draft we will do that in the

359
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,918
next version

360
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,919
so next live

361
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,520
yeah this is the detail of the ifit

362
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,520
attributes subtle v

363
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,360
and uh you can see the list of the

364
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,960
subtle wheels that are

365
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,120
currently defined so the inventory

366
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,000
allocators option the incremental

367
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,280
transoption the direct export option

368
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,280
the h2h option for immanuel

369
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:07,600
and the latest one is about the enhanced

370
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,120
alternate marking subject

371
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:15,678
so in the next slide we can see

372
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,678
the the details of all the

373
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,840
options subtle v in this case we are

374
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,520
talking about

375
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:27,120
sub sub lds of course and the

376
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:31,840
type of these and also the

377
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:35,600
details of the metadata that are needed

378
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:39,360
are taken from the relevant or iom draft

379
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,918
for uh in for example the iron draft in

380
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,918
ippm

381
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,679
so there is something that is not new

382
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,479
now but

383
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,840
it's just taken from the relevant iom

384
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,840
document

385
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
next

386
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,480
uh yeah this is the the attending

387
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,320
matching subfield resource in this case

388
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,840
this is taken from the relevant

389
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,320
alternate marking

390
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,280
document and particularly the

391
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,960
application

392
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,840
the document about the application of

393
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,840
the alternate mark

394
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,799
okay next

395
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:22,720
yeah in this slide we just clarify some

396
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,280
information about the sr policy

397
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,000
operation with active attributes

398
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,000
uh this document complement and we want

399
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,640
to clarify that this document complement

400
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,720
the

401
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,200
segment routing key policy draft by

402
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,080
adding the ip touch bit so

403
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,600
for all the operation we have referred

404
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,799
to this graph

405
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,000
in particular we can consider that these

406
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:50,080
ifit subtleties are optional so

407
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:54,280
an implementation may consider to

408
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:57,520
ignore the unsupported or unrecognized

409
00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:01,520
hypothetily so we don't want that

410
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:04,240
this dld will influence in some way the

411
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,240
the right functioning so it can be

412
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,880
considered as optional

413
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,720
uh on the other hand the sr policy and

414
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,240
lris

415
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,559
that have been considered acceptable

416
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,919
can be evaluated for propagation and can

417
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,799
include also the ifit information

418
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,520
uh regarding the error rendering actions

419
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,960
for now

420
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:30,320
we considered it as

421
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:33,120
for the segment routing key policy

422
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,080
but during a comment we got a comment

423
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,280
from drew

424
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,158
that we have to include some specific

425
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,600
error handling actions also in our draft

426
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,840
i also think

427
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,639
we need so maybe in the next revision we

428
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,720
have to

429
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:52,320
include some information also

430
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:56,320
regarding the error rendering actions uh

431
00:21:52,320 --> 00:22:00,799
for the validation of the fit attributes

432
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:04,879
this is left to the sr policy module

433
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:09,200
as it is also detailed in other case for

434
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,200
by the segment routing t policy graph

435
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,559
next

436
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,039
yeah the for this draft the working

437
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:20,399
group adoption is ongoing

438
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:23,440
i have wrapped up the inputs from

439
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,760
just a summary of the inputs from drew

440
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,480
that will be addressed in the next

441
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,480
revision

442
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:34,080
so we can in particular we have to add

443
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:37,280
more text about the error rambling the

444
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:40,639
procedure for the start stop and update

445
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:44,240
and backward compatibility so we will

446
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,280
complete this part i i didn't

447
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,080
i could not put the

448
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,760
last minute comment from kaiten but we

449
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,039
are having some

450
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:59,200
exchange about we can say the

451
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:02,400
inclusion of the srtm operation

452
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,400
so we may address

453
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,919
you know we are we are building the

454
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,720
building blocks

455
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,400
of the world architecture so of course

456
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,840
we need to

457
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,240
include more details about the srtm we

458
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,520
need to understand if the real place is

459
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,120
this draft or

460
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:24,000
maybe another general draft let's see

461
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,799
so anyway welcome questions and comments

462
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,400
and

463
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,400
thank you for the time

464
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,760
so click on i think you're first

465
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:42,400
uh so thanks deceptive for uh

466
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,600
for your you know responses and update

467
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,400
i wanted to clarify that uh i'm not

468
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,039
asking for more information to be added

469
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,400
into

470
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:55,520
this bgp draft because

471
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:59,120
for most of uh the sr policy

472
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:02,559
uh what bgp is doing is only like a

473
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,120
opaque or an almost opaque uh

474
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,559
kind of a transport functionality and

475
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,439
all of the

476
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,720
actual processing and uh interpretation

477
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,480
and you know provisioning in the

478
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,039
forwarding and all of that

479
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,520
is left to you know what you're calling

480
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,760
also as an srpm module

481
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,360
so my suggestion would be like you said

482
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,240
these are building blocks

483
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,639
my suggestion would be for the authors

484
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,799
to

485
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,960
write that in a separate perhaps in a

486
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,520
spring document

487
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,799
and you know work that through the

488
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,520
spring working group

489
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,039
so i just want to clarify i'm not asking

490
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,120
those things to be

491
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,760
brought into the idr document or the

492
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,239
psap document or the igp documents for

493
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,240
that matter

494
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:51,679
okay okay now i see yeah uh

495
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,320
maybe yeah we need to put this in and

496
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,520
this

497
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,760
general document maybe some exist is

498
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,200
already existing document or a new one

499
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,200
maybe

500
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,279
i would suggest i would suggest a new

501
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,559
one if you don't mind

502
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,039
and uh yeah because without that piece

503
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,000
uh

504
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,279
it's difficult for uh many of us perhaps

505
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,600
or at least me

506
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:17,200
to understand how all of these protocol

507
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:20,719
stuff are kind of fitting together

508
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,039
thank you and i see i see your problem

509
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,039
thank you

510
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,840
thanks okay uh zafar please go ahead

511
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:45,200
so i see you in the queue um you're

512
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,200
unmute yourself and uh speak if you like

513
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:58,559
no yep oh great thanks

514
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,760
so uh my question is that there is

515
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:04,799
a draft uh which is uh

516
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:08,320
uh draft song uh ops a

517
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:10,879
w working group on ifit

518
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,480
framework and that is an individual

519
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,240
document

520
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,799
so i thought it may be better to work on

521
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,679
the

522
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,440
overall framework before defining the

523
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,080
protocol extension

524
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,960
um there are certain elements that are

525
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,879
in the frameworks

526
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,240
that are not covered by the track but it

527
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,360
would be better to

528
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,840
to cover the holistic framework first uh

529
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,719
and the second comment is that i did

530
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,080
notice

531
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:41,120
there's a typo in the adoption poll uh

532
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,559
the the adoption poll points to a

533
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,639
different draft

534
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:48,720
um which is path mtu uh draft

535
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,400
so that may have led to some confusion

536
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,000
during adoption

537
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,840
but anyway there there was a secondary

538
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,640
post to that

539
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,559
to undo it but perhaps it did lead to

540
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,400
some confusion

541
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:08,080
but i did send out a correcting uh

542
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,080
mail to that thank you

543
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,880
but coming back to the first that uh

544
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,320
description before the protocol

545
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,840
extension would be

546
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,678
nice to have and being defined there's

547
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,520
some work also in six men

548
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,559
that is going on this area and other

549
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,559
working groups as well

550
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:35,279
yeah if i can now your first point

551
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,640
so far yeah regarding i know that

552
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:42,320
there is the ip framework draft in upsa

553
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,640
fuji and but uh you can consider that

554
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,879
the first one the observation draft is

555
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,240
the framework so it's a general

556
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,120
draft now we are just building uh one of

557
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,159
the blocks

558
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,840
of the so this is i think is independent

559
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,039
from the word framework

560
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,918
because this this can also be adopted

561
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,200
without

562
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:06,720
the framework because i fit

563
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,120
in this in this case is just used to as

564
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,120
acronym up in c2 flow information

565
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,840
telemetry that stands for

566
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,639
all the on path telemetry in particular

567
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,600
in band ram

568
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,440
and alternate mapping so it is not so

569
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,480
related with the word framework so the

570
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,520
word framework can

571
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:27,200
use this building block but

572
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:30,158
it does not imply that if we

573
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,720
the framework is not accepted this graph

574
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,279
can

575
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,880
can always be used by other

576
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,080
implementation by other

577
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:41,919
architects so i want to make

578
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,918
this different that because i think

579
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:49,679
it's just the athlete acronym is is in

580
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,679
both draft but are two separate things

581
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,840
different in

582
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,200
like postcard telemetry and all that i'm

583
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,840
not too sure how they will

584
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,840
get modified later on once this drafted

585
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,840
adopted

586
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,399
all right let's let's move the rest of

587
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,719
this discussion

588
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,719
um to the list i think that you know

589
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,559
sort of there's

590
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,559
i think i understand your your two

591
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,158
different um perspectives and we

592
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,799
probably won't

593
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,200
make a lot of further headway right now

594
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,039
on it

595
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,960
um in any case i'd like to let the other

596
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,559
two people in the other three people in

597
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,440
the queue speak first and then if we

598
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,240
have

599
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,880
extra time we could continue um so yeah

600
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,880
please go ahead

601
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:54,399
can you hear me yes amazingly well

602
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,240
all right finally all right

603
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,678
that was a good breakthrough here all

604
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,240
right so

605
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,320
um so i had a question regarding i

606
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,120
noticed in the draft it's referencing

607
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,120
the uh

608
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,360
i think it was in section two the bgp

609
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,039
tunnel encapsulation attribute

610
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,039
and i guess in the latest version i

611
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,720
guess there's a lot of updates with the

612
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:17,120
pgp title encapsulation of draft

613
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,520
um that actually in section 37 it

614
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,080
references the prefixes of tlb

615
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,279
so i was wondering like how is uh like

616
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,039
it doesn't have

617
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,399
there's some details that's in the draft

618
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,799
but i was wondering how is the

619
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,760
segment routing key policy leveraging

620
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,080
the prefixes

621
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:37,840
of tlb that's referenced you know with

622
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,840
using the bgp encapsulation

623
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,080
so that was it was in section 2.2 like

624
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:53,120
in this sr policy internal encapsulation

625
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,678
attribute so that the update is there's

626
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,479
a draft for the bgp tunnel encapsulation

627
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,600
attribute

628
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:04,080
like in that draft there's a section 3.7

629
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:06,799
that references the prefixes of tlb

630
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,120
yes we also got a similar comment yeah

631
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:12,480
from you i will i will update of course

632
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,479
i will update it in the next

633
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,320
yeah i was just wondering could you

634
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,720
again describe how is it referenced how

635
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,879
is it

636
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,279
uh you know i guess because it's

637
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,039
leveraging the bgp tunnel encapsulation

638
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,640
attribute but how is it leveraging that

639
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,480
i guess using the prefix sid like when

640
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,559
it's building the candidate path

641
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,559
i guess how is how is it was i guess in

642
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,240
the draft it doesn't have much

643
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,080
detail but i guess that is that what

644
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,360
you're saying you'll update it quick to

645
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:40,240
provide some more detail yes um

646
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,080
because yeah i will write more details

647
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:47,840
about that

648
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,840
okay okay all right thanks

649
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,720
all right thanks and uh zafar i see you

650
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,360

651
00:31:52,720 --> 00:32:01,840
another

652
00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:04,959
point you want to bring

present this uh

673
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,880
draft um bgp extended community for

674
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,919
identifying the target notes

675
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,399
this is a zero three version and here

676
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,880
are the

677
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:58,639
closers of this draft okay next page

678
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,480
please okay first of all a little recap

679
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,760
of this motivation

680
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,240
we know that in some cases

681
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,840
for the pdp route distribution the

682
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,719
target of some of the

683
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,040
bgp routing policy information maybe

684
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,839
just

685
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,359
one or a small group of the b2b speakers

686
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,159
in the network

687
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,960
some examples are the bgp flows back and

688
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,240
the bgp

689
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,079
sr policy and we can see maybe there are

690
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:27,359
also other use cases

691
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:31,040
to which require such kind of behavior

692
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,598
and for bgpsr policy uh the route target

693
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,480
is used to determine the target node of

694
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,000
this uh

695
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,520
as a policy route well for some other

696
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,679
address families

697
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,719
uh the retargeting misdeal needs to be

698
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,159
used for the

699
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:48,399
vrf matching in such cases uh

700
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,960
using rt for both the target node

701
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:53,598
identification and the vrf matching

702
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,320
could be uh problematic we will show an

703
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:59,440
example

704
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:03,599
in the next page okay next slide please

705
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:07,040
okay this picture shows example

706
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,200
when node a want to advertise a vpn

707
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:13,200
flows background

708
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:16,319
to node b at where i have read on node b

709
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,879
and if we use rt to designate the target

710
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,920
node b

711
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,560
we will include both an rt4

712
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,359
identifying the node b and rt identify

713
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,560
the vrf

714
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:29,520
rat in the bgp update message and

715
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,520
this message is sent from a to r and

716
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,880
reflected by r to other nodes in the

717
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,480
network

718
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,599
but this route will be imported by

719
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,560
both node b and node d because i know d

720
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,000
will use the rt red to match with its

721
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,119
local variables

722
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,839
and if it is matched it will import the

723
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,760
route to various red regardless whether

724
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:56,160
this route contains an

725
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,400
rt which identifies node d or not

726
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,920
so we can see there's a problem in such

727
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,720
cases so

728
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,960
the purpose of this document is to

729
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,040
define a generic mechanism to

730
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,520
designate the target nodes for

731
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,520
information advertised using bgp

732
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,560
this can be independent from the use of

733
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,839
rt so

734
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:20,720
you can avoid this kind of problems

735
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,720
shown in this picture next page please

736
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,000
okay this is a proposed solution we

737
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,480
introduced a new

738
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,400
bgp extended community to carry the

739
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,720
target node information

740
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,760
it is called a node target extended

741
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,000
community

742
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,599
and the figure the format is shown in

743
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,960
this picture

744
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:45,119
uh it basically will need to include a

745
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:48,079
four octane target bgp identifier

746
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,480
to identify the target node of this bgp

747
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,119
update message

748
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,920
in one bgp update message it can carry

749
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:59,440
one or more no target extended community

750
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,240
to identify the target nodes a group of

751
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,520
target nodes

752
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,520
in the network let's play next slide

753
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,839
please

754
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,520
okay here we uh summarize the procedures

755
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:16,000
of this mechanism

756
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,280
uh first of all the sending b2b speaker

757
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,079
will need to add

758
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,359
uh one or more no targets to the b2b

759
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,320
update

760
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:26,078
and on the receiver side if one of the

761
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,240
no targets match

762
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,320
in the message matched with a local bgp

763
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,879
identifier the information is out in the

764
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,079
updated message is eligible to be

765
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,560
kept and installed on the receiving node

766
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,920
if the receiving node is a rod reflector

767
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,400
the route is

768
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,359
eligible to be further reflected if

769
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,720
there is other no targets in the update

770
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:50,000
and here the arm may also choose to

771
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,598
reflect the routes only

772
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,079
to the bgp peers whose bgp id

773
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,760
match with the onenote are no targets in

774
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:01,599
the message

775
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,920
and if the receiver is a espr

776
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,599
this route is eligible to be advertised

777
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,320
to its abgb peers

778
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,160
which push bgp id match with one of the

779
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,960
known targets in the update

780
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:16,319
well for this ar sbr case this drought

781
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,599
is just limited to the

782
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:23,520
multiple ass which are administered by

783
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:25,760
uh the same operator for other cases uh

784
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,400
uh for other internal us cases it will

785
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,640
need some further study

786
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,480
and if none of the node targets match

787
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,480
with the local bgp identifier the

788
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,320
information in the bgp update

789
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,160
is not eligible to be installed on the

790
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,079
receiving between node

791
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,200
and if this receiving node is a rotary

792
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,720
reflector

793
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,240
the router is still eligible to be

794
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,279
reflected to its

795
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:51,040
clients or peers the same uh

796
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,040
procedure as above the r may choose to

797
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,560
reflect the roads only to the peers

798
00:38:53,040 --> 00:39:01,839
whose php id match with no target

799
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,839
okay next page please

800
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,319
uh here we show the updates in this uh

801
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,040
latest version

802
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,680
uh first of all we describe the problem

803
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,960
case

804
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,560
in detail uh when the rt based mechanism

805
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,000
is used

806
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:21,040
and we choose to use php identifier

807
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,920
instead of the ipv4 or ipv6 addresses in

808
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,960
the node

809
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,240
extend community this was discussed in

810
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,839
the previous meetings

811
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,359
and also think uh reasonable point to

812
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:35,040
usb identifier

813
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:38,000
in this case and for the procedure

814
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,119
section we also re i reorganized the

815
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,960
content

816
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,280
and include the procedures for both the

817
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,280
rod reflector and the asbr

818
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,560
for the we call it intra domain

819
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,680
scenarios which is

820
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,520
one single operator case

821
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,879
finally we add a compatibility

822
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,400
consideration section

823
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:59,359
in this draft and we will continue to

824
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,800
maybe revise it based on comments about

825
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:05,680
this compatibility

826
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,680
part okay next page

827
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:12,800
for next steps uh here we would like to

828
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,598
collect the

829
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,560
comments and feedbacks from the team

830
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,560
working group

831
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,560
then we can revise the draft accordingly

832
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,680
yeah that's all

833
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,279
uh looks like we have people in the

834
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,279
queue uh jeff you're first

835
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,279
hey this is jeff microphone check you're

836
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:39,040
alive

837
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:42,079
thank you so uh i do find

838
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,480
the idea of a extended community

839
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,920
being used for filtering purposes uh

840
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,440
that's tied to

841
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,440
node semantics to be useful i'm a little

842
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,000
concerned about this being used as part

843
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,960
of reflection

844
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,960
procedures is

845
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:59,598
i would be supportive of seeing

846
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,160
something like this for something like

847
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,440
artik and strain but i don't think i

848
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,598
would want to see this as a

849
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,960
general mechanism applied as a magic

850
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,960
filter around reflection level

851
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,399
okay i think yeah it's reasonable that

852
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:19,280
the rt filtering mechanism can be

853
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,000
optional and we can maybe next version

854
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,119
to say that it's uh

855
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,319
whether to use uh filtering on rt is

856
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,560
determined by

857
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:30,079
the operator's policy and it's also the

858
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:33,200
position of the rt

859
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,760
is something like that

860
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,040
uh sure so the the two things i would

861
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,160
comment on

862
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:43,200
is that if rt constrain is okay

863
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,040
uh there was prior ietf discussion

864
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,640
about allowing rt constraint to be

865
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,520
applied to things that are not route

866
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,480
targets

867
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,960
so this is work that idr has already

868
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,920
decided it's willing to do

869
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,200
my second comment is that if you do want

870
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,240
that

871
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,000
your procedure still may not help you in

872
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,118
your original slides

873
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,160
uh rt constrain says that if any of the

874
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,079
targets match

875
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,200
then it would be received so in your

876
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,800
example where you had

877
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,240
a red and a blue vrf therefore red and

878
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,119
blue route target

879
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,319
if you're trying to do a restriction to

880
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,160
a subset

881
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,759
you still may not get the semantics

882
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,520
you're looking for and i think that

883
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,480
may still be a problem even if you

884
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:29,599
weren't using rt constraint

885
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:32,720
yes yes that's my comments thank you

886
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:35,520
okay i'll just remark that

887
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:38,959
the uh jeff tensura says uh plus one

888
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,960
jeff over in the chat window

889
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:50,399
uh and randy you're up hear me

890
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:53,439
yep uh my

891
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,119
notoriously bad memory is

892
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,280
that the bgp identifier

893
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,520
is unique only within a single

894
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,119
autonomous system

895
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:08,960
therefore i wonder the semantics

896
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,960
of when you cross ebgp

897
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,680
yeah i got your point yeah uh in the

898
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:19,279
beginning we

899
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:22,720
uh firstly consider the use case in the

900
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:26,319
intro as scenario like the using

901
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:29,118
route reflector okay uh for the

902
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:30,319
interiors case as i just mentioned we

903
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,240
firstly want to

904
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:37,680
limit it to the uh multiple ess

905
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:40,479
uh administered by the same operator

906
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,680
in that case maybe the bgp identifier

907
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,880
can be

908
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:48,000
management by the a single uh

909
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:52,839
team and the conflict can be

910
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,839
avoided but i again i know

911
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:59,040
must

912
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:03,599
story can

913
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:06,560
is not identical to must

914
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,599
yeah yeah i agree we need to consider

915
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,759
that

916
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,680
the entire case further and any

917
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:16,400
contribution or suggestion would be

918
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,399
welcome thank you

919
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,839
rudiger please go ahead

920
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:37,839
we see you in the queue but i don't hear

921
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:37,839
you speaking have you unmuted

922
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:46,960
ah okay that's a mechanism um

923
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,839
uh so uh are you essentially at this

924
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,440
point in time

925
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:54,799
saying you will not will

926
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:58,400
slash the inter as

927
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:02,400
case if you do not

928
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:06,800
if you uh want to extend there

929
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:09,839
you have to figure out whether a control

930
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:13,839
of uh

931
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:18,000
propagation of the extended community

932
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:21,759
on ebgp can be done

933
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,760
uh if

934
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:28,480
well okay as far as i remember there are

935
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:33,119
very few bgp implementations

936
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:36,079
out that allow policy to

937
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,200
in fact match certain extended

938
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:41,119
communities

939
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,118
and say please drop these

940
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:49,759
if you if you if you start to propagate

941
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:53,359
such a community and you have to assume

942
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:55,280
that neighbors may not be able to clean

943
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:58,799
up this

944
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:01,839
uh you are you are opening a leak

945
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,400
where uncontrolled control messages may

946
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:06,880
be spread globally that's a really bad

947
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,880
idea

948
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,000
yeah i understand for the intro yes case

949
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,280
uh

950
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,680
many more considerations about this like

951
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,040
external community propagation and the

952
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,759
security

953
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,960
considerations yeah so we we want to

954
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,000
limit the

955
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:29,280
use case to first as a first step to

956
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,480
inquiry as editor maybe multiple years

957
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,839
under the same operators control that

958
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,040
may be more

959
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:40,240
maybe easier uh you could

960
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:43,680
resolve this by just using

961
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:46,399
large communities instead of an extended

962
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,399
community

963
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,520
yeah that may be another way to carry

964
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,759
this information

965
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,800
well me i'm not sure whether why the

966
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,440
community

967
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,240
will not have the similar issue as the

968
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,440
extreme

969
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:06,959
extended community the propagation

970
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:08,960
at the interiors boundary

971
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,400
maybe it can be this can be discussed

972
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,400
further on the main list

973
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,520
okay thanks and uh guillaume let's take

974
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:24,480
this as the last comment because then

975
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:28,160
we'll need to move on to our next one

976
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:30,319
please go ahead so um

977
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,680
the use case that i think that you have

978
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,720
you're addressing is um

979
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,160
is it primarily for for bgp explosive

980
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,759
distribution or

981
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,759
are there like in the draft are there

982
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,119
any other use cases or is it just really

983
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,400
primarily for

984
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,400
for vgp specs

985
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,119
one of the use cases is pgp flows back

986
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,880
well we

987
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:55,760
think it can be generic for other

988
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,760
address families

989
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,400
so you know that like the concept i

990
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,480
think that you're thinking of using

991
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,559
extended community attributes

992
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,079
i guess that's you know with it like an

993
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,480
overlay vpn

994
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,359
you know but if it's really generic it

995
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,920
does sound like

996
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:13,520
you know using large communities or even

997
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,960
maybe standard communities

998
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,680
that it doesn't necessarily have to be

999
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,280
an extended community that could work

1000
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,040
and it could be just just regular

1001
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,559
standard communities may be able to like

1002
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,920
just tagging

1003
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:28,319
you know and it'll be less cut less

1004
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,640
complex

1005
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:32,839
you know versus actually using reusing

1006
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:35,359
extended versus using extended

1007
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:38,799
communities

1008
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:42,000
yeah you mean using standard community

1009
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:45,440
yeah so yeah do the same thing

1010
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,520
also he also makes it independent of vpn

1011
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,400
overlay so it's not it's independent of

1012
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,520
uh

1013
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,880
you know the mpls like vpn construct or

1014
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,640
if you're doing um

1015
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,160
even if you're doing like vrf light but

1016
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:59,598
non-vpd and not

1017
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,759
uh non-mpls related overlay but this

1018
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:04,240
becomes independent it's just just

1019
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,319
you're just tagging and so if you're

1020
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:10,078
just needing to tag you may be able to

1021
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:10,079
get away with standard communities maybe

1022
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:19,599
yeah i got a point i will think about

1023
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:23,599
to compare different options

1024
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,599
and feedback to you later

1025
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,720

all you thanks for the presentation in

1027
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:35,359
the comments

1028
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:36,000
and our final uh presentation for this

1029
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:45,759
evening

1030
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:48,160
or morning or day or whatever it is

00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,480
hello hello

1034
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:01,200
so good afternoon from beijing and uh

1035
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,079
it's good to have you all here and today

1036
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:06,319
i'm going to

1037
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:08,880
uh update you with uh our uh

1038
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:10,480
zero one version draft which we have

1039
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,760
already uh presented

1040
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:16,640
at itf 108 which is titled

1041
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,280
traffic steering using bgp flows back

1042
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:22,480
with

1043
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:22,480
srv6 policy so next page please

1044
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,760
so uh i'm gonna start with uh two

1045
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,760
application scenarios of

1046
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,160
our uh draft so uh generally we want to

1047
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,800
do

1048
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,680
uh traffic steering uh using bgp flow

1049
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,040
spec

1050
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:44,078
and we are not like proposing uh any

1051
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:46,880
uh new encoding uh

1052
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,920
of of uh in this draft but some you know

1053
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,200
operational

1054
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,400
operational changes so uh now suppose we

1055
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,680
want to uh

1056
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,559
this is a l3 vpn uh traffic steering

1057
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,640
scenario

1058
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:00,640
and in the next scenario we'll talk

1059
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:04,078
about the internet traffic steering

1060
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,640
okay and uh in this case we want to uh

1061
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,240
steer

1062
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:11,279
the traffic uh from the the blue pass

1063
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:14,160
to the yellow path okay and then

1064
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,720
um so we have a um either a controller

1065
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,839
or

1066
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:21,359
any just regular uh bgp flow spec

1067
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:24,720
speaker that can advertise bgp route

1068
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:28,558
to the head end of an srv6

1069
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:31,839
domain which is router 2 at this case

1070
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:33,119
and this bgp flows back route will

1071
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:35,359
include

1072
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,400
two major parts the first is the

1073
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:39,279
filtering

1074
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,480
components of course and in this case we

1075
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,359
use the

1076
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,640
destination ip address as the filtering

1077
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:47,440
condition

1078
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,160
which is nothing new but for the action

1079
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,040
parts

1080
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,720
we are this is something we are newly

1081
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,680
proposed in this draft

1082
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,720
so uh we are using a combination of

1083
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:00,000
different uh

1084
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:02,240
action components um here we

1085
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,680
propose to use uh three components in

1086
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,200
this example

1087
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:10,078
the first two is uh the redirect ip

1088
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,558
extended community and the second is the

1089
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,960
color

1090
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,640
extended community community so

1091
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:18,240
basically what you can do

1092
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:21,359
with the two components is that when the

1093
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:24,799
head-end router router 2

1094
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:28,160
receives the two components it can

1095
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:31,200
use it to associate with an

1096
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,319
srv6 policy which as shown in this

1097
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:35,759
figure is

1098
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:39,759
the policy two okay and then

1099
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:42,800
um the third component action component

1100
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:45,440
is uh is actually an

1101
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,440
optional component but in this case uh

1102
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,480
this component is needed

1103
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:53,839
uh is needed which is an l3

1104
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:57,119
uh service seed tlv so

1105
00:52:53,839 --> 00:53:00,558
uh for cases uh especially in

1106
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:03,920
an um vpn traffic's theory uh

1107
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:07,119
case you want to uh like specifically

1108
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:09,680
identify uh which link you want to

1109
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,800
like uh direct the past uh through the

1110
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,000
traffic through

1111
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:17,359
uh you probably need uh to uh

1112
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,520
you know instruct the uh endpoint uh

1113
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:22,240
router to tell it for example in this

1114
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:25,599
case uh to tell it to use the uh

1115
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:28,640
and dx uh function so in this case

1116
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:31,680
uh uh l3 service seed is

1117
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:35,040
carried in this flow spec route

1118
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:37,680
okay and then um can i go to the next

1119
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,680
slide please

1120
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,720
and then in this case uh we showed that

1121
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:47,359
the component three

1122
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,319
which is the service seat is uh not

1123
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,558
mandatory

1124
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,839
which means it's optional but it still

1125
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:54,160
has conditions

1126
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:55,359
so in this uh uh internet traffic

1127
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,879
steering case

1128
00:53:55,359 --> 00:54:02,078
uh we only carried the redirect ip uh

1129
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:05,280
community with the color community to

1130
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:08,480
you know indicate the srv6 policy

1131
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:11,839
um but we don't want to like

1132
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:14,720
specify a dt function

1133
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:15,599
there but this is under the condition

1134
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,959
that

1135
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:22,400
the ant seed is usd flavored

1136
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:25,680
if it's like psp or usb flavored

1137
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:28,880
then you still need an service seat

1138
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:39,040
to instruct the endpoint router

1139
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:42,000
okay and next slide please

1140
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:43,200
so here's a summary of uh you know the

1141
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,839
steps that we

1142
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,799
have uh in this draft and as i said

1143
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:49,839
there's no

1144
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:50,720
new encoding and there's no uh ion

1145
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:54,160
allocation

1146
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,279
actions needed here so what we propose

1147
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,839
is generally

1148
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,760
it could be two steps or four steps

1149
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,640
depending on whether you will use the

1150
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,760
service

1151
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:06,480
of ctlv okay so the first step

1152
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,119
is that you need to generate a flows

1153
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,799
back

1154
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:13,599
route with the the two or three

1155
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:15,040
components we just used in this in the

1156
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,920
example

1157
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,558
the service seat is optional depending

1158
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,799
on whether

1159
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,880
it's necessary and in the second step

1160
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:26,000
the head and should

1161
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:28,319
associate the uh

1162
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,200
the next hop as well as the color

1163
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:32,640
community to

1164
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:35,118
an srv6 policy and then if we have a

1165
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:38,319
service seat in step 3

1166
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:39,520
the head end should put this service

1167
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:41,839
seat into

1168
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:44,240
the the folding packets and then the

1169
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:46,880
packet goes through to the end point

1170
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:48,959
so at step 4 the end point will take

1171
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,640
take further actions depending on

1172
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:56,000
uh the service seat okay

1173
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,000
so next page please

1174
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,079
and uh we have also made two changes

1175
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:05,200
from uh

1176
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,680
the initial version and uh first the

1177
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,319
first

1178
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:10,240
change is the handling of uh multiple

1179
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:13,759
communities and thanks to uh

1180
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:17,359
jeff's comments on that um so

1181
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:20,400
in this draft uh we we only want to

1182
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:23,598
like support or or say we only

1183
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:26,960
allow the usage of uh one

1184
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:29,920
uh redirect ip community with one uh

1185
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,040
color community because we think that is

1186
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,680
sufficient

1187
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,160
and for the for the purpose or say uh

1188
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,359
the

1189
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:40,720
uh intuitive of having you know multiple

1190
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:44,240
uh maybe color community with a really

1191
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,799
ip community is that we possibly want to

1192
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,839
do

1193
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:51,359
load balancing but um i would say that

1194
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:54,400
using only one uh

1195
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:56,880
redirect ip with one color

1196
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,079
community is sufficient for load

1197
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,799
balancing so

1198
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,760
what you do is that you basically uh

1199
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:05,280
configure

1200
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,559
you know multiple uh srv6 seats uh lists

1201
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,079
i'm sorry at least

1202
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:13,440
in an srv6 uh policies so

1203
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:16,720
there you go and for the

1204
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:19,040
second change is uh regarding the uh

1205
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,839
cross domain traffic steering and thanks

1206
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:23,440
to

1207
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:26,640
uh cali rush's uh comment and um

1208
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:29,760
we would say that um the

1209
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,640
you know the handling of uh flow spec uh

1210
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,079
communities

1211
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:37,118
um in this draft for uh both the

1212
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:40,480
uh intro s and the cross as

1213
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:42,480
uh cases uh would be the same the only

1214
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,040
difference uh would lie

1215
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,240
uh in the local srv6 policy

1216
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:49,040
configuration

1217
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:51,279
okay so if you want to do like uh cross

1218
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,880
domain traffic steering then the policy

1219
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,079
should be

1220
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,960
a cross-domain uh policy and uh if you

1221
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:59,920
only want to do

1222
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:03,040
an intro domain then it it will be an

1223
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:06,400
inter-domain policy

1224
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:09,920
so uh uh that that's it for uh

1225
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,480
for the presentation and any questions

1226
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,119
or

1227
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,119
suggestions

1228
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,160
you see go ahead

1229
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:26,000
ac linda um cisco systems should this be

1230
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:29,759
a informational draft

1231
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,119
then because it really uses srv6 and

1232
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,839
redirect

1233
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:37,839
prospect redirect draft

1234
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,839
standards

1235
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,559
well i i i think it could be an

1236
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,759
informational because it's like more

1237
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:49,599
like uh you know and usage of

1238
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,960
some uh existing a combination usage of

1239
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:55,040
some existing

1240
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:56,880
uh like methods

1241
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,480
i'm not quite sure but i think it could

1242
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:04,559
be

1243
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:08,640
okay seems logical to me

1244
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,640
this is who where's cody

1245
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:19,839
yes sue did you have something you

1246
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,839
wanted to say

1247
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:26,720
i don't need to repeat what you said i

1248
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,920
if an informational draft would be more

1249
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:31,118
appropriate

1250
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,119
for this draft

1251
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:35,920
okay we'll change that then

1252
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:43,680
any other comments or questions or

1253
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:46,319
i'm sorry uh i have a

1254
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,879
small suggestion it's more appropriate

1255
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:52,160
to

1256
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:52,160
make it than bcp dropped

1257
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,919
uh i don't know let's take that offline

1258
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,160
i

1259
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,319
would need to go and look the craft over

1260
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,319
again

1261
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:07,440
okay i don't know if anybody else has

1262
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:07,440
any input on that question

1263
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:18,480
jeff sorry

1264
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,079
did i raise my hand i don't think bcp

1265
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,559
quite fits the category at the moment

1266
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:22,559
because

1267
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,920
at the moment does not current practice

1268
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:25,040
so it's not necessarily best current

1269
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,839
practice

1270
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:29,200
it definitely fits in the informational

1271
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:32,000
category and

1272
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:34,160
you know definitely useful okay thank

1273
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,160
